  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?** Feature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?** Can't find a way to place a debugger on \"lifecycle hook scheduled a cascading update\" errors\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI'm getting this error currently, I tried adding a debugger in `react-scheduler` but it seems Webpack doesn't pick it up, which means it's not actually importing that in development mode I guess. I don't see this message anywhere in react.development.js, so I guess I'm wondering where this code is coming from?\r\n\r\nI don't need this as a feature but rather just to know where/how you can get a debug breakpoint here, but after [reading this thread](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/834) I didn't see any clear resolution so I wanted to start a ticket for it.",
