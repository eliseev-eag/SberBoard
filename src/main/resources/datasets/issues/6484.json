  "body": "Hi there, \nYou might know, I guess, that there is an issue about typing Korean in the recent version.\nThe problem is when I try to type Korean, the letters are split.\nKorean letters make group letters from element. for example group letters like\n\n> 리액트(which means React)\n\nis composed of\n\n> ㄹㅣㅇㅐㄱㅌㅡ(sort of R, e, a, c, t) \n\nthe first 2(ㄹㅣ) are put together and make the first group letter(리), and so on.\n\nBefore update, if I type `ㄹㅣㅇㅐㄱㅌㅡ` by order, it automatically put together to be `리액트`. It is possible because there is a rule to make them.\n\nBut now in v15.0.1 if I type `ㄹㅣㅇㅐㄱㅌㅡ`, it doesn't put together, so it shows `ㄹㅣㅇㅐㄱㅌㅡ`.\n\nI tried uncontrolled input, that doesn't set it's value through `onChange & setState`, and I worked right. I guess the problem is in onChange & setState...\n\nKorean is one of the biggest language in the world, about 12th. This issue make new version of React useless to every Korean user... I have to be fixed ASAP.\n\n---\n\nI found I just been fixed. thx.\n",
