Major issue.\r\n- [x] Topbar points to `https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html` which is ugly URL\r\n- [x] We shouldn't use `Number` as an identifier https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8034\r\n- [x] Remove vars everywhere except ES5 page\r\n- [x] JSX in depth has weird names like `Story1`, `render2` @lacker \r\n- [x] JSX in depth shows a failing example with `<hello>` tag but doesn't show how to fix it @lacker \r\n- [ ] Localized pages are gone: need to set up a new streamlined localization effort (cc @thejameskyle)\r\n- [ ] Mention in default index.html that it is not production-ready\r\n- [ ] Mark `mockComponent` as legacy and unnecessary \r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/2499#issuecomment-94044857\r\n- [ ] `shallowCompare` on Addons page should recommend `PureComponent` instead\r\n- [ ] Figure out what to do with Community section (https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6099)\r\n- [ ] Mention string refs\r\n- [x] Forms doc has mistakes\r\n- [ ] Forms doc uses setState for uncontrolled components which is confusing\r\n- [ ] Installation is messy\r\n",
