  "body": "I did some preliminary profiling of React 16 SSR, and I found something very similar to what I found in #6862, that escaping IDs was taking an inordinate amount of time. I wrote a similar solution that shortcuts for strings that don't have characters to escape and loops over matches. With this new implementation, I was able to make my (admittedly rather synthetic) [SSR benchmark](https://github.com/aickin/react-16-ssr-perf) run about 20% faster.\r\n\r\nI tried to run the react benchmark in `scripts/bench` to see if it agrees with my benchmark, but it gives me errors that the `chrome-launcher` module doesn't exist. I think this is because lighthouse's code has been reorganized, and fixing the benchmark seemed a little out of scope for this PR. If anyone knows how to get the benchmark running, I'd appreciate the info!",
