  "body": "The majority of components should have PureRenderMixin-like behavior. With es6 classes and function components, there's no easy way to use mixins. Because it's such a common use case I think it should be part of core react.\n\nI think this will encourage more people to use pure render because it's a lot simpler to add. This is a good compromise on the requests to make pure render the default behavior.\n\n``` js\nclass X extends React.Component {\n  static pureRender = true;\n\n  render() {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nfunction X(props) {\n   ...\n}\nX.pureRender = true;\n```\n\n``` js\nReact.createClass({\n  pureRender: true,\n  render() { \n    ...\n  }\n});\n```\n",
