  "body": "In https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12851 we landed a change to the Flow types in `SimpleCacheProvider`, making the types for the various `Record` types recursive with their `next` and `previous` properties.\r\n\r\nOn that PR we may have been running an older version of Flow - I'm not having luck finding the record of when Flow ran for that PR, so not sure.\r\n\r\nIn any case, that PR was merged even though it had the recursive Flow type definitions, plus one or more Flow errors which were unrelated and not detected.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the recursive type definitions is that recent versions of Flow will go into an infinite loop if they try to infer types which are recursive.\r\n\r\nThe solution may be to add more detail to those types, but to unblock things we temporarily made them looser type definitions.\r\n\r\n",
