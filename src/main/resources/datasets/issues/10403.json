  "body": "Fixes two bugs\r\n\r\n1. **Don't warn about setState on unmounted when scheduling error recovery.** We shouldn't schedule an update on unmounted error boundaries, but we don't know if a boundary is unmounted until we traverse its parents. Added an additional argument to scheduleUpdate so we know not to warn about setState on unmounted components.\r\n\r\n2. **Should be able to unmount an error boundary before it is handled.** Fixes the case where an error boundary captures an error, but its parent is unmounted before we can re-render it. componentDidCatch is never called, and we don't remove the boundary from our set of unhandled error boundaries. A non-null capturedErrors does not imply that we have unhandled errors.\r\n\r\n",
