  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nbug\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\nWhen I use `onFocus` or `onBlur` events on an `<input>` element in my React app, if in the`onBlur` or `onFocus`  event handler I set the input's value to an empty string, I get:\n\n`TypeError·TypeError: property \"value\" is non-configurable and can't be delete` OR\n`TypeError·Uncaught TypeError: Cannot delete property 'value' of #<HTMLInputElement>`\n\nLooking at the stack trace, it's because it is trying to delete the value and detach the onPropertyChange handler when onFocus or onBlur is called: \n\n`attachEvent(\"onpropertychange\",d):A.addEventListener(\"propertychange\",d,!1)}function f(){A&&(delete A.value,A.detachEvent?A.detachEvent(\"onpropertychange\",d):A.removeEventListener(\"propertychange\",d,!`\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\nreact 15.1\nAll browsers\n\nI frankly am not able to reproduce this locally on any browser, but we're seeing this error happen 1000s of times in our bug tracking system. I know this is probably not very helpful but I figured I can at least see if anyone else has run into this. Happy to close this issue if you feel there's not enough information. \n",
