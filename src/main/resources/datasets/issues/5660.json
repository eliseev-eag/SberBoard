  "body": "Are stateless components optimized using React.createElement so they arent re-rendered if the props havent changed?\n\nhttps://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#stateless-functions\n\nIf so, it would be nice to mention that in the docs. Because then there is a significant difference between the following:\n\n``` js\nSomeComponent = (props) => {\n  return <div>{props.hugeList.map(/*...*/)}</div>\n}\n\nPerformant = (props) => {\n  return <SomeComponent hugeList={props.friends}/>\n}\n\nNotPerformant = (props) => {\n  return SomeComponent({hugeList: props.friends})\n}\n```\n\nAnd it may not seem evident to someone thinking that they're just functions...\n",
