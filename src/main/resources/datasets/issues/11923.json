For instance:\r\n```javascript\r\nrender(currentState, currentProps) {\r\n  return ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis could allow destructure the arguments to get only the needed properties, for example.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16.2 (It doesn't work in any React version)",
