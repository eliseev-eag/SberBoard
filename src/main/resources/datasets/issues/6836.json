  "body": "This is a work-in-progress PR to further the discussion of #6618. It re-implements server rendering in a way that supports streaming and is hopefully maintainable with unit tests.\n\n**I'm not asking for this PR to be merged right now.** I'm really only opening this PR to allow folks to easily see the diff and evaluate this implementation strategy, as a robust discussion is going on in #6618 about the right way (if any) to achieve streaming render. So **I'm going to propose that for now we keep the discussion about this strategy over in #6618**. The one exception is if you want to comment on the code, of course feel free to do so here. \n\nIf you have any worries/objections about this plan for the discussion, please let me know!\n# \n\n_Before_ submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done...\n1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`. **Done.**\n2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests! **Done.**\n3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation. **Not done.**\n4. Ensure the test suite passes (`grunt test`). **Currently passes, but two tests have been `xit`ed out.**\n5. Make sure your code lints (`grunt lint`) - we've done our best to make sure these rules match our internal linting guidelines. **Done.**\n6. If you haven't already, complete the [CLA](https://code.facebook.com/cla). **Done.**\n",
