  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nReport a bug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nGlobal `window.event` is overwritten in React 16.5+ in development mode. Here're minimal repro steps:\r\n\r\n- React **16.5.2 in dev mode**: https://jsfiddle.net/sergei_startsev/ecz103vL/2/\r\n\r\nIf you click the button, you see `DOMContentLoaded` event type.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe current behavior contradicts with specified behavior [window property event returns the Event which is **currently being handled** by the site's code. Outside the context of an event handler, the value is **always** `undefined`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/event). Moreover it works properly in production mode:\r\n\r\n- React **16.5.2 in prod mode**: https://jsfiddle.net/sergei_startsev/st5L8e02/2/\r\n\r\nIt returns expected `click` event type.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nIt works properly in React 16.4.2 and prod mode:\r\n\r\n- React **16.4.2** in dev mode: https://jsfiddle.net/sergei_startsev/o26L08qw/\r\n\r\nThe issue is reproduced in Chrome 69. It works properly in FF 62 (`window.event` isn't support in 62, however it should be reproduced in FF 63 - it was recently added, see [details](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/event#Browser_Compatibility)).\r\n\r\nIt seems that the issue was introduced by @ConradIrwin in #11696.",
