  "body": "# React should match the w3c syntax for 'autofocus'\n\nAutofocus is an attribute that auto focuses inputs, forms, or buttons. **Autofocus should not have the 'true' or 'false' attributes, nor camel case.**\n### HTML demo http://codepen.io/JulianNorton/pen/xEJaBz\n### Current situation in React: https://jsfiddle.net/7cdxevyo/6/\n#### The following are valid, equivalent and true [w3c]\n\n```\n<input type=\"text\" autofocus />\n<input type=\"text\" autofocus=\"\" />\n<input type=\"text\" autofocus=\"autofocus\" />\n<input type=\"text\" autofocus=\"AuToFoCuS\" />\n```\n#### The following are invalid [w3c]\n\n```\n<input type=\"text\" autofocus=\"0\" />\n<input type=\"text\" autofocus=\"1\" />\n<input type=\"text\" autofocus=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"text\" autofocus=\"true\" />\n```\n\n> A number of attributes are boolean attributes. **The presence of a boolean attribute on an element represents the true value, and the absence of the attribute represents the false value.**\n> \n> If the attribute is present, its value must either be the empty string or a value that is an ASCII case-insensitive match for the attribute's canonical name, with no leading or trailing whitespace.\n> [w3c source](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#attr-fe-autofocus)\n## Recommendation\n\n**Update syntax from `autoFocus={true}` to `autofocus` or `autofocus='autofocus'`**\nHere's an example of what should be considered valid: https://jsfiddle.net/qfrp4az7/1/\n\n`react: 15.3.2`\n",
