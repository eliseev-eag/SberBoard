  "body": "I was a little bit surprised that my reducer was letting me modify the `state` argument, in a TypeScript project:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst reducer: Reducer<SomeStateType, SomeActionType> = (state, action) {\r\n  switch (action.type) {\r\n    case 'increment':\r\n      state.count += 1;\r\n      break;\r\n    default:\r\n      throw new Error();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return state;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would expect to see:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTS2542: Index signature in type '<Readonly<SomeStateType>>' only permits reading.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Suggested change**\r\nUnless I'm not correctly understanding all of the use-cases, we should never be able to modify the `state` argument in the example above. What do you think about updating the type definition for `Reducer`?\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntype Reducer<S, A> = (prevState: <Readonly<S>>, action: A) => S;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also tested that there is no negative implication of \"double-wrapping\" with `Readonly`, in the case where `S` is already defined as a `Readonly` type, i.e.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// @file some-reducer.ts\r\ntype S: <Readonly<SomeStateType>>;\r\n\r\n// @file react/index.d.ts\r\ntype Reducer<S, A> = (prevState: <Readonly<S>>, action: A) => S;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nusing: react@16.8.6 (`useReducer` hook)\r\n",
