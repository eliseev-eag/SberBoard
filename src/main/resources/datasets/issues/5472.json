  "body": "As per comments from @samwgoldman in the following issue, the flow built-in react type definitions are lagging behind and the recommendation is that the definitions be included and maintained in the react repo itself: \n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/1081\n\nThe flow maintainers are doing an excellent job of implementing new JS syntax/features. It would be great if they did not also need to maintain this file:\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/flow/blob/master/lib/react.js\n\nOne could, of course, also relegate this definition to yet another repo.\n",
