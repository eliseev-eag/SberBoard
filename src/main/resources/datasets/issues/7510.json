  "body": "It used to be slow whenever a type miss occurred because expensive `Error` objects were being created. For example, with `oneOfType([number, data])`, passing a date would create an `Error` object in `number` typechecker for every item.\n\nThe savings depend on how much commonly you used `oneOfType()`, and how often it had “misses”. If you used it heavily, you might see 1.5x to 2x performance improvements in `__DEV__` after this fix.\n\nThanks to @spicyj @sebmarkbage for ideas on how to fix this.\n",
