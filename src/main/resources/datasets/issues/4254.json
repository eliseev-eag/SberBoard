  "body": "Currently i'm trying to replace some parts of a huge AngularJS application with React. My goal is to speed up rendering times, especially when it comes to displaying large dataviews.\n\nWhile trying so, i ran into a strange problem. When trying to call React.render() multiple times on the same `tbody`-Element, React throws the following two warnings:\n\n> Warning: render(): Target node has markup rendered by React, but there are unrelated nodes as well. This is most commonly caused by white-space inserted around server-rendered markup.\n> react-with-addons.js:21560\n> \n> Warning: React attempted to reuse markup in a container but the checksum was invalid. This generally means that you are using server rendering and the markup generated on the server was not what the client was expecting. React injected new markup to compensate which works but you have lost many of the benefits of server rendering. Instead, figure out why the markup being generated is different on the client or server:\n>  (client) <tbody data-reactid=\".\n>  (server) <tr data-reactid=\".0.$\n\nI created a simple fiddle just for demonstrating the issue: https://jsfiddle.net/4ca8tkj1/\n\nThe same code works, if i render into a `div`-Element for example: https://jsfiddle.net/5adr5xet/\n\nAm i missing something here?\n\nPS: Thanks for your awesome work on React.js - still love it â™¥\n",
