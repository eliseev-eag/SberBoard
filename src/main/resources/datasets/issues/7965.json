  "body": "I think i have discovered a jsx gotcha i see nowhere mentionned.\nLet's say we have a component defined like this \n\n``` jsx\nconst Comp = ({foo})=>{  \n   const applyer = (foo)=>(\n      <OtherComp stuff={foo}/>\n   );\n   const ResultComp = applyer(5);\n   return (\n      <div>\n         {ResultComp}\n      </div>\n   );\n};\n```\n\nIntended behaviour : in the rendered output, `<OtherComp/>` should be provided with stuff=5, but it receives instead the value of the foo prop provided to Comp, which means variable shadowing does not work.\nI suspect this is relative to the template like behaviour of JSX, but since i have been bited by this gotcha, i think it should be mentionned in the docs.\n\nThe correct code to make this work is \n\n``` jsx\nconst Comp = ({foo})=>{  \n   const applyer = (fooNoConflict)=>(\n      <OtherComp stuff={fooNoConflict}/>\n   );\n   const ResultComp = applyer(5);\n   return (\n      <div>\n         {ResultComp}\n      </div>\n   );\n};\n```\n",
