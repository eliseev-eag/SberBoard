  "body": "We support a very unusual kind of components that look like functional components but return an *instance*.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction Hello(props) {\r\n  return {\r\n    componentDidMount() {\r\n      alert('wow')\r\n    }\r\n    render() {\r\n      return <div>Hi, {this.props.name}</div>\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote these are *not* functional components. They're pretty exotic and don't offer any practical benefits over classes. At the time they were added (I think 0.14?) it was because we thought other type systems might want to compile to a format like this instead of ES classes-like output. But that didn't happen.\r\n\r\nThere's some complexity associated with continuing to support this. Since this is more confusing than useful, I think we should deprecate them in 16.x and remove in 17.x.",
