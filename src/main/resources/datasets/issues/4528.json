  "body": "jscodeshift was fully upgraded to babel and now also transforms transform files (hah!). This simplifies the codemod repo structure quite significantly as we no longer need babel or a build process. See https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift/releases/tag/v0.3.0 (this PR is only blocked by https://github.com/benjamn/ast-types/pull/120 being merged to make the tests pass).\n\nI changed the README instructions to install jscodeshift and clone this repo to run the codemods. If we decide to split off react-codemod into a separate repo, this will make more sense because users won't be required to clone all of React but I think this is fine for now.\n",
