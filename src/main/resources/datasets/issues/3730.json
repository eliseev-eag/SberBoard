  "body": "Hi.\n\nWhen running React.renderToString() on my node.js server I get no error messages when there is a error. Instead everything just stops, and the browser get no response. I've added propTypes, and they give me errors. But if a key inside a object isn't there, there is no error message. This is a big problem when I'm trying to learn React to other developers. Is there a callback or anything to detect errors in React.renderToString?\n\nThanks.\n",
