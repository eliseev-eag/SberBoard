  "body": "I'm not entirely sure if what I'm having here is a problem with Mocha or React, but I really need some help figuring out why my tests are failing with what looks like leaks across siloed documents.\n\nMy test setup is using Mocha, where each individual test spins up a document with jsdom before loading React. I then proceed to run the test of the individual component in each of these separate documents.\n\nMy tests run fine if I only run a single file at a time, but when I run all tests I get errors like `DOMException: Wrong document` (from jsdom) and `Error: Invariant Violation: findComponentRoot(..., .1): Unable to find element...` (from React).\n\nI've created a repository with a minimal setup and a more detailed description here: https://github.com/Munter/MochaJsdomReact\n\nCan anyone help me figure out what the problem is, and how to avoid it, or maybe even fix it?\n",
