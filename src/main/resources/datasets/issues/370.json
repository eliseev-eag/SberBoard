This is not a sustainable long\nterm solution (we shouldn't make people choose like this) but it fixes\nthe problem we have in the short term.\n\nThis also removes the terrible react-transitions build. This is better\nanway.\n\nFixes #369\n\n```\nRunning \"compare_size:files\" (compare_size) task\n   raw     gz Sizes\n320704  62665 build/JSXTransformer.js\n462810  96559 build/react-with-addons.js\n 96721  27035 build/react-with-addons.min.js\n429162  89475 build/react.js\n 90003  25164 build/react.min.js\n```\n\nLet's hold off merging until:\n- [x] We're happy with what's on `React.addons` (as the repo stands today)\n- [x] We update the release tasks so `react-with-addons.js` gets added to the bower repo & starter kit\n- [x] Addons builds end up in `react-source` gem\n- [x] Addons builds end up on builds server\n- [x] We have example(s) using this build\n- [x] Update docs to mention the new build and the things that go along with it. - #314 \n",
