  "body": "I ran into a similar situation a couple of times: https://jsfiddle.net/gjf6u5of/2/\n\nThere is some component that throws for some reason. I got some weird prop and got upset. The stack trace, however, doesn't tell me anything. I doesn't even point me to `<Foo />`. They only non-react frames are the one with `<Fooo />` (the outer-most component) and then with the throwing component.\n\nI would be great if a situation like this was easier to debug. In particular, seeing the state of the parent component would help a lot.\n",
