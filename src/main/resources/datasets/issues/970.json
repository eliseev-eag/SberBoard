  "body": "It currently generates \"pretty output\" as we agreed upon, it respects original indenting all that, newlines are kept as-is. It also puts `{}` at just after/before the outer `()`.\n\nThere is only one case that I know of currently that produces incorrect output and that is when the attribute name and value are on different lines (see below), I could fix it, but I don't think it's worth the code complexity for something you really shouldn't do, but I could fix it.\n\nI back-tracked on removing trailing spaces after commas, it's not super hard to do, but it's a bit of messy to sort out and I don't find it worthwhile right now. I'll leave it for another PR for now.\n\nI haven't had time to test it extensively yet.\n\nPS. There's a also a bunch of source code lines that got trimmed now that I'm using a better editor (I unintentionally added them with my previous whitespace PR).
