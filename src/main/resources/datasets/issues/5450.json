  "body": "I noticed an undocumented change (at least I didn't find it) from React 0.13 to 0.14\n\nNow, React doesn't rerender the component when it is exactly the same instance (i.e. when you save a `<reactComponent />` in a variable), look:\n\nReact 0.13.3: https://jsfiddle.net/zac5zuLo/\nReact 0.14.2: https://jsfiddle.net/2f6muyuk/\n\nEven further, this is not only using React.render, if the components below doesn't have state neither any props, and we just try to rerender the same instance with a forceUpdate or setState for example, the rendering is skipped, look:\n\nReact 0.13.3: https://jsfiddle.net/zac5zuLo/1/\nReact 0.14.2: https://jsfiddle.net/2f6muyuk/1/\n\nI couldn't find this on the react update changelog, maybe it falls under `Many small performance improvements have been made`.\n\nAnd just to be clear, it does work if your components instantiates a new children on the render method, like this:\n\nReact 0.14.2: https://jsfiddle.net/2f6muyuk/2/\n",
