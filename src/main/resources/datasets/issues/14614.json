  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWhen using `useEffect()`, `useMemo()` or `useCallback()`, we can use the 2nd argument to avoid rerunning the effect or updating the value unnecessarily if the values it depends on haven't changed.\r\n\r\nShould I include setters returned from `useState()` in the 2nd argument of these hooks? E.g.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst [value, setValue] = useState(5);\r\n\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  // Hand off setValue somewhere\r\n}, [setValue]); // ?\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm wondering what the exact validity guarantees are around the setters returned by `useState()` or the dispatch functions returned by `useReducer()`. According to the docs, the dispatch function returned by `useReducer()` shouldn't change between re-renders, so it shouldn't be necessary to include it in the 2nd argument of these hooks. `useState()` seems to use `useReducer()` internally, so the same is possibly true for it. Is it officially guaranteed that any setter returned by `useState()` remains valid until the component unmounts?",
