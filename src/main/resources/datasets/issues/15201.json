  "body": "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nMy question is pretty simple but the answer can be complicated I guess.\r\nHave you ever experimented with Suspense together with Redux. I mean, is it possible to wait with Suspense (showing Loader) until Redux will fetch data(with axios for example) and save it to the store? Or should we just wait for the future releases where combining Redux and Suspense will be simple? Meanwhile, is there a way to implement this scenario already?",
