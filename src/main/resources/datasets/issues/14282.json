  "body": "Whenever we do this, Rollup needs to materialize this as an object. This causes it to also add the Babel compatibility property which is unnecessary bloat. However, since when we use these, we leak the object on the `this` binding which could deoptimize inlining/DCE. Most of the time this just works because GCC is smart enough to see that it doesn't leak but not always. By avoiding this pattern it's more predictable.\r\n\r\nIf we really need an object we should export default an object.\r\n\r\nCurrently there is an exception for DOMTopLevelEventTypes since listing out the imports is a PITA and it doesn't escape so it should get properly inlined. We should probably move to a different pattern to avoid this for consistency though.\r\n\r\nDo we need to add this as a lint warning?",
