  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nMost likely a **bug**\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/r555ro878p\r\n\r\nIf you open that sandbox and wait for a compiler to catch up, you see that `TextReturningComponent` has an error. It is expecting `ReactElement<any> | null` to be returned.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst TextReturningComponent: React.SFC = () => 'sometext'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nBased on the [blog post](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/26/react-v16.0.html#new-render-return-types-fragments-and-strings) it should be possible to have a component like that. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nLooking at the [type definition for](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/react/index.d.ts#L292) `render` method it has return type `ReactNode` which is correct. However, the SFC declaration looks like this...\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ninterface StatelessComponent<P = {}> {\r\n  (props: P & { children?: ReactNode }, context?: any): ReactElement<any> | null;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI assume this is just an oversight and there should be `ReactNode` type as well? In case that's true, I am able to create PR for that. Correct me if I am missing something here, please :)\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"react\": \"^16.2.0\",\r\n\"@types/react\": \"16.0.36\",\r\n```",
