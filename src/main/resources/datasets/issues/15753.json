  "body": "<!--\r\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\r\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen updating `top` inline style on an absolutely positioned element in a relatively positioned parent with vertical overflow, the style attribute value updates in the DOM tree, but UI is not repainted to reflect the new value.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nMinimal Demo: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-scrolling-bug-e7l4f\r\n1. Create `div` with a child to apply style to and some text\r\n2. Restrict parent `div`'s size so that text overflows\r\n3. Set parent `div` to `position: relative` and `overflow-y: auto` (`overflow-x` doesn't seem to affect bug)\r\n4. Set child to `position: absolute`\r\n5. Add state to component to track the `scrollTop` value of the scrollable parent `div`\r\n6. Create `onScroll` SyntheticEvent handler that sets the `scrollTop` state\r\n7. Use the `scrollTop` state value to set the absolutely positioned child's `style.top` attribute\r\n8. Attempt to scroll parent but see that child element's position does not update even though, upon inspection, the `style.top` value is being set\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe DOM should be repainted whenever the `style` attribute changes so that changes are immediately visible.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact: 16.8.6 and 16.4.2 (2 different web app projects I work on)\r\nOS: Windows 10, build 17134.765\r\nBrowser: Google Chrome 74.0.3729.169\r\n\r\nNOTE: Tested in MS Edge, and behaves as expected.  May possibly be a Chrome bug and not a React bug.  I ran through several JS commands to set the style attribute without React, though, and Google Chrome updated as expected.\r\n\r\n",
