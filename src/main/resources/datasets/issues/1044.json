  "body": "I'm trying to unmount a React.js node with `this._rootNodeID`\n\n```\n handleClick: function() {\n\n    React.unmountComponentAtNode(this._rootNodeID)\n\n }\n```\n\nBut it returns `false`.\n\nThe `handleClick` is fired when I click on an element, and should unmount the root-node.\n\nI've tried this as well:\n\n```\n  React.unmountComponentAtNode($('*[data-reactid=\"'+this._rootNodeID+'\"]')[0])\n```\n\nThat selector works with `jQuery.hide()`, but not with unmounting it, while the documentation states it should be a `DOMElement`, like you would use for `React.renderComponent`\n\nAfter a few more tests it turns out it works on some elements/selectors.\n\nIt somehow works with the selector: `document.getElementById('maindiv')`, where `maindiv` is an element not generated with React.js, and just plain html. Then it returns `true`.\n\nBut as soon as I try and select a different `ElementById` that is generated with React.js it returns `false`. And it won't work with `document.body` either, though they all essentially return the same thing if I `console.log` them (`getElementsByClassName('bla')[0]` also doesn't work)\n\nThere should be a simple way to select the node via this, without having to resort to jQuery or other selectors, I know it's in there somewhere..\n",
