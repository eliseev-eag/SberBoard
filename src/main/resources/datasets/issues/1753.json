  "body": "When using components with missing/invalid prop, then a warning is logged.\nSame when a child key was not provided.\n\nI would like an error to be thrown instead.\n\nThis has already been discussed on some issues like: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1587\n\nBy the way, I totally support this related issue, to ensure proper Proptype documentation of all components, but would require an error instead of a warning :)\n\nThe more we fail in dev, the better. It would be nice to be able to use React in a very strict way, by using some configuration attribute or something...\n\nOne other thing I would probably add is to enforce all components have a name.\nSee https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1751\n",
