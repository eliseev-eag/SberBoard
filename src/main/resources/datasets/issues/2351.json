  "body": "I thought I'd bring this up before it's set in stone. Since `React.createElement` is intended mostly as a non-user feature as I understand it, wouldn't it make sense to take the opportunity to also change its signature to `React.createElement(type, children)` to avoid varargs for a potential perf boost.\n\nNon-scientific test: http://jsperf.com/varargs/2\n\nPS. Hmm, I guess we already support this... by simply providing only an array to children. But it seems that just touching `arguments` is a significant slow-down (relatively, not necessarily in practice).\n\ncc @sebmarkbage \n",
