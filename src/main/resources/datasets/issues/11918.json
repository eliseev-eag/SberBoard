  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIn mobile Safari, DOM events originating from elements rendered through a Portal do **not** bubble (propagate) up the React component tree.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce....**\r\nPlease see the following JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/zebulonj/wf7orwan/\r\n\r\nIn this JSFiddle, the expected behavior (seen in a desktop browser) is that clicking on the portal content (appearing as a modal, including backdrop) should toggle to the \"On\" or \"Off\" indicator rendered in the main content. However, in mobile Safari (iOS 11.1.1), the click events do not propagate.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nClick events should propagate up the React component tree.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nAffected: React 16.2\r\niOS 11.1.1\r\n",
