  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nFeature/Question\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nReact escapes everything inside href attribute. I belive there are cases when it's undesirable.\r\n\r\nI'm using `renderToStaticMarkup` to render emails that are being sent by Sengrid. Sendgrid provides a functionality to inject links to autogenerated preferences and unsubscribe pages. It does that by replacing some placeholders within emails with actual URLs. Placeholders looks like that: `<%asm_preferences_raw_url%>`. The problem is the React encodes `<` and `>` and the placeholder becomes `&lt;%asm_group_unsubscribe_raw_url%&gt;`.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if there is a solution for that or am I am doomed to `dangerouslyInserInnerHTML` hack?\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/ko4qzq9415\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThere should be a way (different than `dangrouslyInsertInnerHTML`) to avoid escaping.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nAny\r\n",
