  "body": "I have some components that are done such that:\n\n``` js\nvar Example = React.createClass({\n   render: function(){\n    return(\n      <div>\n        ...\n        <SomeComponentName />\n     </div>\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nWhen this component is mounted is there away to say unmount the `SomeComponentName`? Can I do that on the fly or do I have top find the node that `SomeComponentName` is attached to and then unmount it via the node like the docs state.\n\nRight now it only seems like you can unmount by node but if you could unmount by component name that would make life a lot easier in some cases where on route change you only ant to unmount specific components via their name.\n\nMaybe I missing something?\n",
