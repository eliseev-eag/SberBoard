  "body": "Implemented by adding a new field to Fiber called `contextTag`. (Naming suggestions welcome; \"context\" is way overloaded.) It's a bitfield that describes properties about the fiber and its subtree. For example, the AsyncUpdates flag indicates whether the subtree should be async-by-default.\r\n\r\nWhen a fiber is created, it inherits the `contextTag` of its parent. The value is set at construction and is expected not to change once the fiber's children have been reconciled.\r\n\r\nThe user-facing API as implemented in ReactDOM is `ReactDOM.unstable_renderAsync` to create an async-by-default tree, and `instance.unstable_asyncUpdates = true` to create an async-by-default-subtree. We'll use these to incrementally introduce async scheduling in our experiments.\r\n\r\nThe new features are behind a flag called `enableAsyncSubtreeAPI`.\r\n\r\n### Update\r\n\r\nDecided not to add a `ReactDOM.unstable_renderAsync` method in favor of always using `unstable_asyncUpdates = true`, to avoid API bloat. Also, `unstable_asyncUpdates` is now a static method instead of an instance method, which means it works with both functional and class components.",
