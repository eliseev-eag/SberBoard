  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nA bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nReact breaks\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nI wasn't able to create a jsfiddle but this is what's going on:\r\nI am setting up a template for a way I want to build my site, this is (a part of) my structure:\r\n\r\n- src\r\n    - components\r\n        - frames\r\n            - `index.js`\r\n        - pages\r\n            - `index.js`\r\n    - `App.js`\r\n    - `index.js`\r\n\r\nIn `index.js` I import `App.js` and then render it to the DOM\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\r\nimport App from \"./App\";\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById(\"root\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn `App.js` I import my frame\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\nimport Frame from \"./components/frames\";\r\n\r\nconst App = () => <Frame />;\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the index of the frames folder I import a page\r\n```js\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\nimport Page from \"../pages\";\r\n\r\nconst Frame = () => <Page />;\r\n\r\nexport default Frame;\r\n```\r\nin that index I actually do something\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\n\r\nconst Page = () => <div>Hello, world</div>;\r\n\r\nexport default Page;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point a little cumbersome, but still, pretty straight forward. Whenever I do this, my dev server won't load and will eventually give a 'page not responding' error. When I was messing around with it I got it to work once, but then, when I went back to my actual structure (even more deeply nested, exactly like I do above) it will break again.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nReact rendering normally\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.8.6\r\nApp with create-react-app on windows 10\r\n",
