  "body": "I'm trying to compile this example and ran into two issues. The first was that it seemed I needed to install babel-cli, which I did and was able to run the next set of commands but then I get this error:\n\n```\nSyntaxError: example.js: Unexpected token (8:11)\n   6 |       'React has been successfully running for ' + seconds + ' seconds.';\n   7 |\n>  8 |     return <p>{message}</p>;\n     |            ^\n   9 |   }\n  10 | });\n  11 |\n```\n\nI'm still new to using React so it's probably a user error but I figured I'd put in an issue just in case. \n",
