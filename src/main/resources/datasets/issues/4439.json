  "body": "It seems that for widest email client support using the bgcolor attribute on td tags is the best route: https://litmus.com/blog/background-colors-html-email\n\nI would like to write and render my emails in React, since building up the email in components would alleviate some of the pains of using tables for layout and use of inline styles via js would be helpful. But the inability to use the bgcolor attribute is a road block. Would this be ever supported in the future?\n",
