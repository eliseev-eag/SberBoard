  "body": "`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` expects valid sanitized markup from a library like `marked`.  We may not be able to guarantee that the markup is sanitized, but we can spot many obvious errors which are an indication that markup is unsanitized.  Things like an `&` instead of an `&amp;` as per https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5223#issuecomment-184373913.  This is also a good thing to warn about because we can catch subtle SSR markup checksum issues.  If the markup doesn't validate, we should warn.\n\nThe only tricky part here is that we don't want to have the markup validation library required in the production build.\n",
