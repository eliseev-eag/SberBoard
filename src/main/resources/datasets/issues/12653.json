  "body": "I updated a package to work with react 16.3.2. `unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer` was used there. When I replaced it with `createPortal`, nothing happened and no errors were displayed. I wasted several hours to understand that `unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer` could be used anywhere, for example in `componentDidUpdate` (as it was in my case). But `createPortal` can be used only in `render`. So it would be great to have a warning when it is used outside render to let people know what they are doing wrong. And maybe consider adding a note on this in the docs. Thanks.",
