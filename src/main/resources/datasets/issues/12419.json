  "body": "After a lot of discussion and careful consideration, the team has reaffirmed the initial decision to not call _unsafe_ legacy lifecycles `componentWillMount`, `componentWillReceiveProps`, and `componentWillUpdate` for any component that defines the new static `getDerivedStateFromProps` lifecycle. (This applies to the \"UNSAFE_\" aliases as well.)\r\n\r\nThe reason for this decision ultimately boils down to support for the [react-lifecycles-compat polyfill](https://github.com/reactjs/react-lifecycles-compat) and concerns about consistent, predictable behavior for future version of React.\r\n\r\nAs @jquense pointed out with issue #12411, conditional lifecycle behavior is a _new_ thing, and it is not intuitive. For this reason, we needed to improve the granularity and wording of the DEV warning. This PR does that, first by expanding the warning conditionals to explicitly check for `componentWillMount` and `componentWillUpdate` as well (rather than just `componentWillReceiveProps`) and secondly by explicitly stating that \"_Unsafe legacy lifecycles will not be called for components using the new getDerivedStateFromProps() API_\".\r\n\r\nThe entire new DEV warning is:\r\n```\r\nUnsafe legacy lifecycles will not be called for components using the new \r\ngetDerivedStateFromProps() API.\r\n\r\n<YourComponentName> uses getDerivedStateFromProps() but also contains \r\nthe following legacy lifecycles:\r\n  componentWillMount\r\n  componentWillReceiveProps\r\n  componentWillUpdate\r\n\r\nThe above lifecycles should be removed. Learn more about this warning here:\r\nhttps://fb.me/react-async-component-lifecycle-hooks\r\n```\r\n\r\nTests have been updated as well to verify the new behavior.\r\n\r\nResolves #12411",
