  "body": "**Apparently @spicyj already has a pending PR for this that should be considered instead, https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/591.**\n\n---\n\n`key` is currently only obeyed by descendants of the root-node, the root-node itself does not obey `key`. This simple fix ensures that it works on the root-node as well.\n\nI would consider this a bug and speaking hastily to petehunt, he seemed to agree:\n\n`<@petehunt> yeah i think that would be a bug`\n\nMy personal motivation for this is my `<swf>`-component that I will be releasing, it requires this to support changing `src` at run-time (although other workarounds do exist). In my opinion, there's no reason why the root-node should be any different from the other children in this regard.\n",
