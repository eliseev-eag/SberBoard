  "body": "Based on #14952\r\n\r\nUpdates the noop renderer tests to conform to the changes coming in #14853. It overlaps slightly with that PR but it doesn't implement the logic to warn when you nest async `act` calls; it only adds a warning if you call `act` without awaiting it.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we should merge this PR now or if we should wait for #14853 to land first. It may make sense to merge this one and then rebase Sunil's forthcoming changes on top of that.\r\n\r\nIn other words, @threepointone, feel free to ignore this PR if you like â€” it only exists to potentially make your life easier.",
