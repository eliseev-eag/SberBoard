  "body": "It would be nice if in a component I could declare which property (or state) is transferred automatically from parent as a property in this component. For example now If couple of components inside Form require transferring properties from it I'm forced to repeat those properties many times (and I would like to hide them as they represent kind of internal details about relation between child and the parent):\n\n```\nForm = React.createClass({\n      render: function() {\n            <div>\n                <TextField formStatus={this.props.status} formLoading={this.state.loading} title=\"Username\"/>\n                <TextField formStatus={this.props.status} title=\"Password\"/>\n            </div>\n      }\n});\n```\n\nWhat I would like to be able to do is:\n\n```\nTextField = React.createClass({\n      applyFromParent: function() {\n            return {\n                 status: 0, // 0 is a default value in case status prop didn't exist in parent\n                 backgroundColor: 'red',\n                 formLoading: false\n            }\n      }\n      render: function() { return .... }\n});\n```\n\nThanks to that I could write:\n\n```\n<div>\n    <TextField title=\"Username\"/>\n    <TextField title=\"Password\"/>\n</div>\n```\n\nI stumbled across this problem few times already. I think my requirement doesn't violate any React data flow rules. It simply helps to avoid boilerplate. I wonder if React authors had this problem and if they're planning to implement something like this.\n",
