  "body": "Here’s my outline of what I think we should do with addons in React 16.\r\n\r\nTLDR: we’ve done a poor job of supporting them, and they pose a significant maintenance burden due to how our repo and build process is set up. We’re going to release final versions for them, and won’t be maintaining them further.\r\n\r\n# Plan: Don’t Do Anything\r\n\r\n## react-addons-perf\r\n\r\nInternal dependencies (will break in 16):\r\n  * `react-dom/lib/ReactPerf`\r\n\r\nPlan for 15.5: don’t do anything.\r\n\r\nPlan for 16: we won’t be releasing 16 for this package. Right now there is no migration path planned for it because Fiber works differently. Instead, you would use the [browser Timeline integration](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9071) (or polyfill it in your environment). We may later reintroduce something like `ReactPerf`, but in the renderers themselves. However, just like it took us a while to figure out how `ReactPerf` should work, it will take us a while to figure out a better alternative that would be compatible with Fiber.\r\n\r\n# Plan: Fix and Forget\r\n\r\n## react-addons-create-fragment\r\n\r\nInternal dependencies (will break in 16):\r\n  * `react/lib/ReactFragment`\r\n\r\nPlan for 15.5: copy internal dependencies into the package to make sure it works standalone. Ensure there is a UMD build in the standalone package, and that it is documented in package's README. Make sure that accessing it via `React.addons.createFragment` (but not via the package) warns once and suggests using UMD build instead. Release 15.5 without a peer dependency restriction on `react` and forget about it forever.\r\n\r\nPlan for 16: we won’t be releasing 16 for this package. Nevertheless version 15 should keep working indefinitely.\r\n\r\n## react-addons-linked-state-mixin\r\n\r\nInternal dependencies (will break in 16):\r\n  * `react/lib/LinkedStateMixin`\r\n\r\nPlan for 15.5: copy internal dependencies into the package to make sure it works standalone. Ensure there is a UMD build in the standalone package, and that it is documented in package's README. Make sure that accessing it via `React.addons.LinkedStateMixin` (but not via the package) warns once and suggests using UMD build instead. Release 15.5 without a peer dependency restriction on `react` and forget about it forever.\r\n\r\nPlan for 16: we won’t be releasing 16 for this package. Nevertheless version 15 should keep working indefinitely.\r\n\r\n## react-addons-pure-render-mixin\r\n\r\nInternal dependencies (will break in 16):\r\n  * `react/lib/ReactComponentWithPureRenderMixin`\r\n\r\nPlan for 15.5: copy internal dependencies into the package to make sure it works standalone. Ensure there is a UMD build in the standalone package, and that it is documented in package's README. Make sure that accessing it via `React.addons.PureRenderMixin` (but not via the package) warns once and suggests using UMD build instead. Release 15.5 without a peer dependency restriction on `react` and forget about it forever.\r\n\r\nPlan for 16: we won’t be releasing 16 for this package. Nevertheless version 15 should keep working indefinitely.\r\n\r\n## react-addons-shallow-compare\r\n\r\nInternal dependencies (will break in 16):\r\n  * `react/lib/shallowCompare`\r\n\r\nPlan for 15.5: copy internal dependencies into the package to make sure it works standalone. Ensure there is a UMD build in the standalone package, and that it is documented in package's README. Make sure that accessing it via `React.addons.shallowCompare` (but not via the package) warns once and suggests using UMD build instead. Release 15.5 without a peer dependency restriction on `react` and forget about it forever.\r\n\r\nPlan for 16: we won’t be releasing 16 for this package. Nevertheless version 15 should keep working indefinitely.\r\n\r\n## react-addons-update\r\n\r\nInternal dependencies (will break in 16):\r\n  * `react/lib/update`\r\n\r\nPlan for 15.5: copy internal dependencies into the package to make sure it works standalone. Ensure there is a UMD build in the standalone package, and that it is documented in package's README. Make sure that accessing it via `React.addons.update` (but not via the package) warns once and suggests using UMD build instead. Release 15.5 without a peer dependency restriction on `react` and forget about it forever. In README, mention https://github.com/kolodny/immutability-helper as a more maintained alternative.\r\n\r\nPlan for 16: we won’t be releasing 16 for this package. Nevertheless version 15 should keep working indefinitely.\r\n\r\n## react-linked-input\r\n\r\nInternal dependencies (will break in 16):\r\n  * `react/lib/LinkedValueUtils`\r\n\r\nPlan for 15.5: copy internal dependencies into the package to make sure it works standalone. Release 15.5 without a peer dependency restriction on `react` and forget about it forever. There is no extra step for `React.addons` because it is not exposed there at all.\r\n\r\nPlan for 16: we won’t be releasing 16 for this package. Nevertheless version 15 should keep working indefinitely.\r\n\r\n# Plan: Deprecate and Forget\r\n\r\n## react-addons-css-transition-group\r\n\r\nInternal dependencies (will break in 16):\r\n  * `react/lib/ReactCSSTransitionGroup`\r\n\r\nPlan for 15.5: deprecate. We won’t maintain this further. Suggest using `CSSTransitionGroup` from https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group instead. Work with its maintainers to ensure there’s an UMD build (and instructions for it in README).\r\n\r\nPlan for 16: we won’t be releasing 16 for this package.\r\n\r\n## react-addons-transition-group\r\n\r\nInternal dependencies (will break in 16):\r\n  * `react/lib/ReactTransitionGroup`\r\n\r\nPlan for 15.5: deprecate.

Technically it’s still going to be coupled to `react-dom` package. `TestUtils` is technically two completely different things: a thin wrapper around `react-dom` with some introspection, and a shallow renderer. Perhaps it would make sense to completely move `TestUtils` to `react-dom` except shallow renderer which could be published as `react-shallow-renderer`.\r\n\r\n",
