  "body": "I realise contexts are basically undocumented and unsupported so this is shaky territory API wise.\n\nI have a use-case for multiple node packages with their own React installed. Each package provides a Component or two using its own React instance, from its own node_modules folder. I'm finding when using contexts I get the message:\n\n`Warning: owner-based and parent-based contexts differ (values:`undefined`vs`bar`) for key (message) while mounting Message (see: http://fb.me/react-context-by-parent)`\n\nWhen I try and pass contexts down to all the elements. \n\nIf I consolidate the Components into one package then everything works as expected. If I keep separate packages, but export a factory that takes the React instance as a function, everything works as expected. Browserify probably conveniently gets around this with the dedupe if they're all identical versions. Running on the server unfortunately does not.\n\n[Here's a code sample with everything in 1 package working fine](http://smallmu-sandbox.s3.amazonaws.com/react-contexts-single-package.zip). You'll need to run npm install from the project root directory and run `node index.js`.\n\n[Here's a code sample with the separate package and its own instance of React](http://smallmu-sandbox.s3.amazonaws.com/react-contexts-multi-package.zip). You'll need to npm install from the project root directory and <project root>/node_modules/sub-component.\n\nI have three questions: \n1. Is this expected behaviour for contexts, to depend on the React instance?\n2. I've seen people running into problems with multiple React instances in other issues. Is this something I should be avoiding?\n3. If it is something I should be avoiding, is it expected to remain this way for the short/medium/long term or forever?\n\nAlternatively, am I using contexts incorrectly?\n\nThanks for your time, and a wonderful library.\n",
