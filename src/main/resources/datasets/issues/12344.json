  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nThis is a bug in latest react v16.2.0\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIt does not listen to programatically generated key events with react@16.2.0, but with older react@15.5.2 It does the job.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nFind below link for codeSandbox\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/pklvvz6vw0\r\nthis is a basic react app which is trying to dispatchEvent and fill the input field after click on 'Inject' button. react version for this sandbox is react@15.5.2\r\n\r\nif you check the console. It is logging current state of React component\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nif we change version of sandbox to 16.2.0 (latest). It does fills expected value in textbox but it does not get recognised in React internal state. and console log is blank. which means id did not even trigger any internal state change.\r\n\r\nwhat can we do if we want to fill the input textbox programatically.  \r\nwe are setting up our internal test framework where we would want to generate all events manually to observe the entire app behaviour.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nworks with react@15.5.2 but not with latest 16.2.0\r\n",
