  "body": "Not sure this should be filed as a bug, or if this is intended behaviour, in which case it would be more of a feature request, for something that we lost since the last few versions.\n\nWhich is more specific error logging.\n\nSince the last few version this error shows up too many times, without any usable stack-trace:\n\n`There is an internal error in the React performance measurement code. Did not expect componentDidMount timer to start while render timer is still in progress for another instance.`\n\nThis mainly occurs when a prop or state is not defined. This wouldn't be a big problem if I could stacktrace it, but in this case I cannot lead it back to any related component, I have to go off on what I changed last.\n\nI do use `redux` and the stacktrace does go back to createStore and then connect, but this should not be related since this error shows up regardless of which element has an undefined property.\n\nIt is also often accompanied by: \n\n`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '_currentElement' of null`\n\nHow do I debug this error? Or are there plans to improve this?\n",
