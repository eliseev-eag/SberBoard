  "body": "Working against master isn't as straightforward in React as it is in other JS libraries. Typically, it's possible to just point to a SHA commit in your NPM and have it `npm install` and work against that version of the codebase. Since this doesn't happen in React due to the compile step, it'd be nice if there were an official nightly dev-build of React available on NPM.\n\nOne main benefit of this would be for library authors, making it easier to check their projects against changes going into master and potentially weigh in on issues - one example that comes to mind is the warnings which now are around in [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/issues/638) in 0.13 due to some of the context changes.\n",
