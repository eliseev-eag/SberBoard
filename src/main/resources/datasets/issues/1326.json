  "body": "While trying to convince React to replace DOM nodes in-place (which seems is not supported), I've discovered something that looks like bugs. I've put up a demo on http://jsbin.com/hokahaze/6/edit .\n\nFirst of all, if a node gets replaced while animation is progressing, it is not removed. In the demo it means additional lines are created. As soon as the animation completes, the node usually goes away.\n\nThe second \"feature\" here is that if you leave that demo running, change to another tab, wait 10 seconds and change back to the tab with the demo running, it will now have accumulated lots of \"green items\" which are basically stuck (meaning their animation completed, but they were not removed from the dom).\n",
