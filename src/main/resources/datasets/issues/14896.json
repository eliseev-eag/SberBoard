  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have the following problem :\r\n\r\n— When I drag/drop item to an another `array()` > it re-renders the item I moved — (Why?)\r\n\r\n— When I drag/drop in the **same** `array()` > it's not renders. So it's GOOD !\r\n\r\nThe problem is my deepest child, I have a little `fetch()` to retrieve some additional data. \r\nThese data are already fetched.\r\nSo when I drag/drop **I don't want** another fetch. \r\nEvent `React.memo()` solve the problem.\r\n\r\nYou can check the console of CodeSandbox to see the problem :\r\n\r\n\r\n###  [https://codesandbox.io/s/03on3k75xw](https://codesandbox.io/s/03on3k75xw)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nNo re-render of the item, since React already displays it, I just moved to another array. It's still the same item.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n```\r\nReact 16.8.1\r\nMacOS 10.14.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nReact Beautiful Dnd : https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd\r\n\r\n",
