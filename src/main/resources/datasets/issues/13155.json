  "body": "I started looking into fixing https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10188 (which I think would be good before we do https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13149), but it was really hard to understand what's going on in the SSR stack handling because of the unnecessary mutable state.\r\n\r\nI added a detailed test to capture regressions to this part of the code, and then refactored it to remove the stateful `currentDebugElementStack`. We could already get it from the frame if we only passed it down, which is what Iâ€™m doing. This also makes the `!== null` check [motivated in this comment](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10187#discussion_r127573702) unnecessary because even if it's re-entrant, we're going to access the right reference from the argument.\r\n\r\nIn a follow up, I'll try to fix reentrancy for SSR (and add test coverage around that).",
