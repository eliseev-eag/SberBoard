  "body": "#5672 made it clear that we could do better. #5658 improved the situation slightly but we still don't discuss how to actually use these things together.\n\nQuickest short term fix would be to explicitly describe how you would use DefinePlugin to do what envify is doing - https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/592692202335301636 is nice and concise.\n\nLonger term I'd like to have some more flushed out docs around using React from start to finish with both browserify and webpack (and maybe more if needed). But let's start simple.\n",
