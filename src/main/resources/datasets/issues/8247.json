  "body": "> Nobody wants to see `class=\"null\"`. :)\r\n\r\nApologies for this being so small, but I wanted to confirm that this is the approach that you guys wanted to take wrt to helpers - I was going to start working on reconciling styles, but that's a hairy beast and I don't want to make a mess of things without verifying that component-level reconciliation is intended to be inlined into this file.\r\n\r\nIs the `DOMRenderer` supposed to get huge as more features are built, or should each chunk of logic live in another module?\r\n\r\nThanks for your time! ðŸ˜„ ",
