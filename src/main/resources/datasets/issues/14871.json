  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nQuestion / feature\r\n\r\nI've been trying to handle a case where I need to execute a piece of code right after the state is set at a particular place in the code. I do understand I'm supposed to use `useEffect` to respond to changes in state, like so:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst [val, setVal] = useState(null);\r\nuseEffect(() => { /* handle changes to val here */ }, [val])\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the problem is, it will run on all changes made to `val` anywhere in the code. Without the second argument of `setVal` being a callback that'll run after the state is set, how can I execute something after a specific `setVal` function call sets the state ? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
