  "body": "Sending this against master because it's independent and self-contained.\n\nA few changes to unpack here:\n- Updated it to use `babel-standalone` because it is much newer. This is already done in #7668 but since that didn't get merged yet I'm just doing it here, and we can clean up other places as part of #7864. There were no other places where this particular hosted file was used.\n- Changed homepage examples to use ES6 classes.\n- Changed code editor to only show JSX transform but eval code with JSX+ES2015. Verified the eval'd code has ES2015 by console.log()-ing it.\n- Tweaked the examples for better readability.\n- Changed the `render()` to be at the top of Todos example so that you see it immediately and it matches what you see on the screen.\n- Updated main README too.\n- Trimmed extra newline at the beginning from the examples.\n\nHere's how it looks now:\n\n<img width=\"955\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-10-04 at 18 44 45\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/810438/19085941/165bb610-8a64-11e6-89b5-283c43ccb91c.png\">\n\n<img width=\"950\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-10-04 at 18 44 53\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/810438/19085943/1a6620ba-8a64-11e6-9199-8e65fe2f51d8.png\">\n\n<img width=\"949\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-10-04 at 18 46 31\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/810438/19085948/1e4f20f0-8a64-11e6-915f-470a27db89c8.png\">\n\nCompiled JS view:\n\n<img width=\"639\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-10-04 at 18 55 47\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/810438/19085972/352fe714-8a64-11e6-99ab-edb0ece30205.png\">\n",
