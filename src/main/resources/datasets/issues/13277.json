Running on physical iPad works, as does Android emulators.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nComplete Process:\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/tPvpRuh\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\niOS simulators connect to Metro Bundler.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact Native 0.56.0\r\nMacOS 10.13.6 (17G2112)\r\nSame process works on my 2015 Macbook Pro 15\", without issue.",
