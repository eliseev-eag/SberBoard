  "body": "Fixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10993.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t seem like jsdom reproduces the original issue (?!) so instead I added a `<noscript>` into our SSR fixture. I verified the warning appears without the fix, and disappears after the fix.\r\n\r\nThe `<noscript>` tag is special because the browser parses it as text content when scripting is enabled. However, the way we normalized HTML did not reproduce the same behavior faithfully because we didn’t include the `<noscript>` tag itself into that HTML. Therefore, it didn’t switch the parsing mode to treat its content as text.\r\n\r\nThe fix adds a special case for `<noscript>` to wrap it an extra time. I decided to special-case it because it seemed more solid than always wrapping (which is not always possible to do one level, e.g. `tr > td` case).",
