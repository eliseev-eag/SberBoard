  "body": "<!--\r\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\r\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nMight be a bug?\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nReplaced componentWillReceiveProps() with a newly added getDerivedStateFromProps() but the warning keeps appearing in the console.\r\n\r\nI doubted the higher order component at first sight, so removed all the coupling with this component's higher order wrapper. I also removed `children` in render() in an effort to remove all the side effects.\r\n\r\nApparently there's no componentWillReceiveProps() in this component but I cannot get rid of this warning. The only thing I could do was to explicitly assign null to `this.componentWillReceiveProps`, then the warning was gone.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something or is it a bug? I also wish this warning could be optionally turned off in development environment. (Considering the legacy React libraries still use them and can be injected by e.g. HOC)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13134658/38181829-29968f48-3670-11e8-8cd5-be24fe2d6d1e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nclass RootContainer extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    super();\r\n    this.state = {\r\n    };\r\n    this.componentWillReceiveProps = null; // Only way I can turn that warning off\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, prevState) {\r\n    // ...\r\n    return prevState;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>1</div>\r\n      // <Root>\r\n      //   {this.props.history \r\n      //     ? this.props.children \r\n      //     : null}\r\n      // </Root>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nexport default RootContainer;\r\n// export default withRouter(connect(makeMapStateToProps)(RootContainer));\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nNo warning (or at least to turn that off by option even in `development` environment)\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n- React 16.3.0\r\n- React-DOM 16.3.0\r\n- React-Redux 5.0.7\r\n- React-Router-DOM 4.2.2\r\n\r\n**UPDATE Apr 4** \r\n- React-hot-loader 4.0.0 **(CAUSE OF WARNING)**",
