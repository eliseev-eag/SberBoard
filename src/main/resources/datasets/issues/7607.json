  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nBug (from a React user's perspective).\n\n**Why does this matter?**\nThis matters in the context of server-side rendering. I want to have the structure\n\n```\nrender() {\n    return <div>\n        <noscript><StaticComponent /></noscript>\n        <DynamicComponent className=\"yesscript\" />\n    </div>;\n}\n```\n\nwhere my page template contains `<noscript><style>.yesscript{display:none;}</style></noscript>`. Then JS-disabled users will see the static one, JS-enabled users will see the dynamic one, and everyone will be happy.\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/r1k4q6tx/; open the JS console, then click the \"Re-render\" button in the fiddle\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\n`Uncaught Invariant Violation: Unable to find element with ID 3.`\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nThe button should update to \"Re-render (1)\", as it does when you remove set `includeNoscript = false`.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\nI tried 15.3.1 in Chrome 52 Linux. (I understand why it's happening, so I don't think the browser or OS is an issue. The JSX for the fiddle seems not to work in Firefox, but I can reproduce the non-minimal version of the problem there, too.)\n\nI don't know much about how the rehydration process works, but it seems like a reasonable solution might be to pass right over `noscript`s when rehydrating; if JS is enabled, they won't be visible anyway. (In Chrome and Firefox, at least, the noscript setting seems to be constant mod a refresh, so we don't have to worry about changing between renders.)\n\nIt seems to me like this might deserve a fix in trunk, but I would also appreciate any workaround (short of rendering a `<noscript><App /></noscript>` and outputting the whole page twice, which I would really prefer not to do).\n",
