  "body": "After upgrading to v15, my isomorphic rendering app whines on page load.\r\n>warning.js:36Warning: React attempted to reuse markup in a container but the checksum was invalid. This generally means that you are using server rendering and the markup generated on the server was not what the client was expecting. React injected new markup to compensate which works but you have lost many of the benefits of server rendering. Instead, figure out why the markup being generated is different on the client or server:\r\n (client) <!-- react-empty: 1 -\r\n (server) <div data-reactroot=\"\r\n\r\nIt turns out that there is a [change in v15](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/04/07/react-v15.html#document.createelement-is-in-and-data-reactid-is-out) removing `data-reactid` attributes in rendered HTML, but server side rendering method `renderToString` still generated `data-reactid`. As a result, `ReactDOM.render` and `ReactDOMServer.renderToString` never matches and it just keeps whining on error.\r\n\r\nI tried to replace `renderToString` with `renderToStaticMarkup` and the error disappeared. However, there is no `data-react-checksum` attribute in generated HTML markup. In my memory, the `data-react-checksum` attribute is to check whether browser and server side generated HTML matches. Now, there is no such checksum, then every render just compare the whole generated DOM? Will that hurt performance?\r\n\r\n",
