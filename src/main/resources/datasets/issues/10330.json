I can't find find answers on those questions on `Jest`'s website or `enzyme`'s (I know that it's not Facebook) either.\r\n\r\n* If I render a component into a DOM in a test, how will it be destroyed?\r\n* Should I clean up by myself?\r\n* What tools to use for this?\r\n* Just `.unmountComponentAtNode()`?\r\n* Where I will get the container to pass in?\r\n* What about additional component trees like in Popovers?\r\n* What are the best ways to test that there aren't any parts left after my component were unmounted?\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIt will be nice to see such information before people will met memory leaks in their tests, and also help to establish good practices for writing tests.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n",
