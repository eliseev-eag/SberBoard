  "body": "**Summary:**\nSee the style proposal on react-future: https://github.com/reactjs/react-future/blob/master/04%20-%20Layout/Inline%20Style%20Extension.md\n\nThe goal is to enable writing CSS purely in JavaScript. We've been using this for a couple of internal projects and it's proven to be a very expressive tool.\n\nNote that this diff doesn't bring `StyleSheet.create` nor `StylePropType`. I'm keeping it simple by just allowing arbitrary arrays, objects and falsy values.\n\nExample of use:\n\n``` javascript\n...\n  render: function() {\n...\n    <div style={[styles.base, this.state.active && styles.active]} />\n...\n\nvar styles = {\n  base: { color: 'red' },\n  active: { fontWeight: 'bold' }\n};\n```\n\n**Test Plan:**\n\n```\ngrunt test\n```\n\n**Reviewers:** jwalke zpao sema\n**CC:** tomocchino\n",
