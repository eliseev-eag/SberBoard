  "body": "This gives markdown headers an id so that we can link directly to\nsections of our docs. This is better than the alternative of adding them\nall ourselves.\n\nI think this is better than what @SanderSpies added in #359 (sorry!) and is more maintainable. I tried switching to a different markdown parser (maraku) but it struggled with some of the things we do and I think this is _pretty close_ to what maraku does. I'm actually going to take a look at what it does and maybe get inspired... with fewer additional dependencies.\n\nDon't merge me yet.\n",
