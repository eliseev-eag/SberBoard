  "body": "Within: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/shared/HTMLDOMPropertyConfig.js#L108 `is` is listed as a supported HTMLDOMProperty.\n\nHowever, including `is` anywhere in the component means that react treats it as a custom component and will just dump all key=\"value\" pairs without handling other supported HTMLDOM properties like `className` etc.\n\nI came across this when trying to do server side rendering for a third party library that expands `is` into `style={...}`. \n\nI don't expect react to care about the external library overloading `is`, but is it confusing that its listed as a valid HTML property in the release notes, but if you use it it also treats the DOM element as custom.\n",
