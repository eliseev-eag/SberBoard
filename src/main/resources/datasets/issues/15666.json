  "body": "Currently `setState` inside `flushSync` will flush within an offscreen tree. This is because our offscreen bailout is buried into `updateHostComponent` which doesn't run in the jump-over bailout codepath as we go towards the deep update. This duplicates the check there. The new test fails on master. (I'm not sure I understand the change needed in another test so this needs some caution.)\r\n\r\nI've also flipped the condition in both places to check the mode first. Since this is likely a more common first check that will be false.\r\n\r\nNote this adds some overhead in CM to the jump-over bailout codepath. Maybe this is the time to add `<Offscreen />` instead?",
