  "body": "No ostensible bug report or feature request, just genuine interest in the internal dialogue of those who design React.\r\n\r\nWhat motivated the decision to introduce the new `.memo` feature as a separate, opt-in higher order component rather than just not rendering when a function's props haven't changed?\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, a functional component should, by design, have no side-effects; so it shouldn't matter if it won't re-render when none of the inputs have changed. This alternative approach would enforce this behaviour.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was to maintain backward-compatibility in a point release? Or perhaps it was because functional components don't have any state (and therefore can't by default store any `prevProps` objects; but surely React pulls the props from the tree mid-updating [[see, for instance, here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cbbc2b6c4d0d8519145560bd8183ecde55168b12/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L280)].)\r\n\r\nAny light you can shed on this design decision – and anything else that might seem relevant – would be of great interest to me, and would help me on my way to understanding and appreciating this beautiful framework, and language. Thanks!",
