  "body": "I am currently attempting to create a button which is red with the text \"Yes\" that when you click on it the button changes to a green color with the text \"Confirm?\" before the final stage in which an action takes place. Where I am currently at is defining `buttonColor` as a state which changes on the click of the button; the initial color should be `#FD8F83` and the final color after the click should be `#A4D87C`. However, I am currently getting the error \"TypeError: Cannot read property 'state' of undefined\" pointing to the `style={{backgroundColor: this.state.buttonColor}} ` line whenever the code is compiled on the webpage. \r\n\r\n**Defining initial state and behavior on click:**\r\n```\r\ngetInitialState: function() {\r\n    \treturn {\r\n    \t\tbuttonColor: \"#FD8F83\"\r\n    \t};\r\n},\r\nhandleClick(color) {\r\n    \tthis.setState({\r\n\t\tbuttonColor: color\r\n\t}); \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Code inside table in render():** \r\n```\r\n<td>\r\n\t<button \r\n\t\tclassName=\"removeButton\" \r\n\t\tstyle={{backgroundColor: this.state.buttonColor}} \r\n\t\tonClick={function(){this.handleClick(\"#A4D87C\")}}>\r\n\t\tYes\r\n\t</button>\r\n</td>\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any ideas why this is? I am brand new to React so I apologize if it's obvious. I also learned React using createClass so I've been trying to piece together how to make this work with the new `create-react-class` package. Any advice is greatly appreciated! \r\n\r\nReact: `^16.2.0`\r\nChrome: `Version 63.0.3239.132 (Official Build) (64-bit)`\r\n",
