  "body": "Proposed in this [issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11935).\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago i was attempting to support this the same as it was proposed in this [comment](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11935#issuecomment-356024356). \r\n\r\nWhile I was studying React keys flow, i realised that once a key prop is not valid (it holds a non string or number value), React takes the value as default (null) on `ReactElement`. I'm not quite sure how it'd deal on Fiber though.\r\n\r\n![index](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13281562/36062670-310bbeb4-0e58-11e8-9f86-9ac8b77e4d14.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe the solution proposed by @gaearon is better because it would bring a bit of tracing for key props and would help on creating features like [this](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11996).\r\n\r\nI'm open to suggestions for the \"tracing\" enhancement.",
