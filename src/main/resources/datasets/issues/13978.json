You can even use the react dev tools to work out exactly which line the component is defined in the code.\r\n\r\nSimply logging the element is obviously not the most elegant way of showing the user where the mistake is, but would it be possible to do _something_ in order to make it quicker to fix mistaken prop passing like this?\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nAll.",
