  "body": "I'm experimenting with a different way of applying styles. My approach is easily applied with Angular using a directive attribute, but React is my library of choice. [Radium](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium) is a similar example. They wrap the `render` function in order to apply their logic for styling. I suspect there is an opportunity to improve the modularity of React by having an API to set custom attribute handlers and checking/running them when React processes a node's attributes. The current React style attribute processing could be done by a plugin, rather than having the behavior hardcoded in the library. This should make it much easier for libraries like Radium, and after glancing over the source, it looks to be easy to implement this behavior.\n\nI would be glad to work on this and to submit a PR if it is agreed this is a good idea. Here's a quick suggestion for the API:\n\n```\nReactDOM.setAttributeHandlers({\n  style: function(node, value) {\n    // custom logic for applying styles (value) to node\n  }\n});\n```\n",
