  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?** Bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?** React warns you to add `onChange` to `<select multiple>`, even if there is `onMouseDown` (the child options having `onMouseDown` should also be enough!).\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.** https://jsfiddle.net/4zy2esnn/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?** There should *not* be the following warning.\r\n\r\n> Warning: Failed form propType: You provided a `value` prop to a form field without an `onChange` handler. This will render a read-only field. If the field should be mutable use `defaultValue`. Otherwise, set either `onChange` or `readOnly`. Check the render method of `App`.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?** Observed in 15.4.2. I’m assuming all versions of React are affected.\r\n",
