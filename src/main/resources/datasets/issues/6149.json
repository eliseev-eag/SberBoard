  "body": "This relates to the issue described here: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6142\n\nI believe this fixes the intended behavior - unless I have misunderstood the old implementations comment and prepending was the desired behavior. It certainly fixes an issue I was having with this when the children are completely replaced with a new array of children.\n\n`mergeChildMappings` now preserves the order so that new children are appended rather than prepended when _all_ old nodes are removed.\n\nI've also added tests and updated a couple of `CSSTransitionGroup` tests to reflect this.\n",
