On the other hand, the error value provided to `getDerivedStateFromError` is bizarre in that `typeof(error)` is `object` but it has no properties, `toString` returns an error message, and data like `lineNumber` etc don't exist.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI expect the error provided to both `getDerivedStateFromError` and `componentDidCatch` to be the same.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.6.3.",
