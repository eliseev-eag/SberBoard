  "body": "There's a few separate issues but I wanted to file an issue to track them in general:\r\n\r\n* `useState` doesn't offer a way to bail out of rendering once an update is being processed. This gets a bit weird because we actually process updates *during* the rendering phase. So we're already rendering. But we could offer a way to bail on children. **Edit: we now _do_ bail out on rendering children if the next state is identical.** \r\n* `useContext` doesn't let you subscribe to a *part* of the context value (or some memoized selector) without fully re-rendering. **Edit: see https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/15156#issuecomment-474590693 for solutions to this.**",
