  "body": "As I prepare to refactor the Fiber scheduler, I've noticed some quirks in our implementation. This PR addresses one of them.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere's no reason for a timed out Scheduler callback to check `shouldYield`, because the value will always be false until the work has completed. The `didTimeout` argument provides this information to the callback so it can avoid the redundant checks.\r\n\r\nReact's existing check for whether a callback has timed out didn't make any sense, but happened to work anyway. I don't think the wrongness of the old implementation is observable via React APIs but it's incoherent regardless.",
