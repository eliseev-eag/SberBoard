If you click the button, which calls `this._form.submit()`, it does not.\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n`form.submit()` should trigger `onSubmit`\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n15, Chrome (did not test others, unknown if broken in previous versions)\n",
