  "body": "**what is the change?:**\r\nWe want to support calling ReactScheduler multiple times with different\r\ncallbacks, even if the initial callback hasn't been called yet.\r\n\r\nThere are two possible ways ReactScheduler can handle multiple\r\ncallbacks, and in one case we know that callbackA depends on callbackB\r\nhaving been called already. For example;\r\ncallbackA -> updates SelectionState in a textArea\r\ncallbackB -> processes the deletion of the text currently selected.\r\n\r\nWe want to ensure that callbackA happens before callbackB. For now we\r\nwill flush callbackB as soon as callbackA is added.\r\n\r\nIn the next commit we'll split this into two methods, which support two\r\ndifferent behaviors here. We will support the usual behavior, which\r\nwould defer both callbackA and callbackB.\r\n\r\nOne issue with this is that we now create a new object to pass to the\r\ncallback for every use of the scheduler, while before we reused the same\r\nobject and mutated the 'didExpire' before passing it to each new\r\ncallback. With multiple callbacks, I think this leads to a risk of\r\nmutating the object which is being used by multiple callbacks.\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nWe want to use this scheduling helper to coordinate between React and\r\nnon-React scripts.\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nAdded and ran a unit test.",
