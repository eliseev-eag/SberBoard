If you are sure you have a compatible version of @babel/core, it is likely that something in your build process is loading the wrong version. Inspect the stack trace of this error to look for the first entry that doesn't mention \"@babel/core\" or \"babel-core\" to see what is calling Babel.\r\n\r\nThis error has been reported, tried many methods, but still unable to solve\r\n",
