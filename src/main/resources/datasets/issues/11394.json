  "body": " I am a reasonably familiar React coder that was looking for a simple template for a image oriented app.  I downloaded and reviewed/hacked/played with many of the examples in this section.  While most are useful I did notice something that I felt was worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I am alone but I find that many files are  confusing when trying to figure out how code works.  Perhaps it is the hangover for java trained engineers bringing their coding style to javascript?  If so then I really wish I had been to the party!\r\n\r\nThe very nice emoji search app is a good example.  If one consolidates all the files into one file one can make a version that is clear and readable and easily understood with  fewer lines of code **than there are code modules** to wade through to figure out how the code works.\r\n\r\nI actually thought this to be impossible  (and it is impossible  with 80 character or 132 character lines) but with the full use of a 1080p monitor it is very easy to do.\r\n\r\nI am only mentioning this here because react seems to be a particularly sprawling framework that could do with a bit of grooming.  \r\n\r\nMost of the demo's from FB with react are single page demo's (more or less).  \r\n\r\nDoes anyone else agree with me? and if so I would like to propose that there be a section of examples called \"full app snippets\" (or something equally silly) for those of us who get _directory vertigo_  easily. \r\n\r\nSometimes it reminds me of sitting in the back of a car reading a book \r\n\r\non a very windy road :)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9357805/32138757-9d1158ca-bbed-11e7-8433-4de1430e1381.png)\r\n",
