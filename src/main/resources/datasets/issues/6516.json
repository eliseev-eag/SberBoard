  "body": "`ReactDOMInput` and a few other classes handle change event by [scheduling `updateWrapper()` in an `asap()`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/6a8c7518d39d8f1a03543e23aa0c6060a44772e6/src/renderers/dom/client/wrappers/ReactDOMInput.js#L235-L238). It gets executed after the batch, which confuses `ReactPerf` that expects all DOM writes to happen during a batch.\n\nThis causes it to throw when calculating `printWasted()` if you interacted with an input before taking the measurement: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5548.\n\nSince this implementation of `ReactPerf` relying on the stack is [going away](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6046), let's plug the hole temporarily by ignoring DOM writes that occur during postponed `updateWrapper()`. In any case, they have no relation to actual calculations of wasted renders, as they don't occur due to `updateComponent()`, but rather due to `onChange()` special DOM behavior.\n\nThis fixes #5548. Thanks to @Danita for her [help investigating the issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5548#issuecomment-210096490) which allowed me to find the minimal case to repro this.\n",
