  "body": "\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nI am attempting to do \r\n`formHandlerRef =  React.createRef()`\r\nthen attach it to an MDB Col as a ref\r\n\r\npass this down as props to another component\r\n`scrollToFormHandler = () => {\r\n   const formHandler = this.formHandlerRef.current;\r\n   formHandler.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'start', inline: 'start' });\r\n  };`\r\n\r\nand call the function from a child component.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe intended behavior is when the props function is fired off in the child component (after the formHandler component has been rendered and is on another part of the screen) to scroll into view which I have achieved with the following code.\r\n\r\n`scrollToFormHandler = () => {\r\n    // eslint-disable-next-line react/no-find-dom-node\r\n    const formHandler = ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this.formHandlerRef.current);\r\n    formHandler.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'start', inline: 'start' });\r\n  };`\r\n\r\nI have looked online and tried finding any other situations where this was a problem or something I may be missing but have found nothing yet so I am coming here. This may be a problem on my end but just wanted to bring it up in case.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI am using `create-react-app`\r\n`    \"prop-types\": \"^15.7.2\",\r\n    \"react\": \"^16.8.6\",\r\n    \"react-dom\": \"^16.8.6\",\r\n    \"react-router-dom\": \"^4.3.1\",\r\n    \"react-scripts\": \"^3.0.1\"\r\n `\r\nThank you!",
