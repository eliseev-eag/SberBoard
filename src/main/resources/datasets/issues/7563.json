  "body": "Hi everyone.\n\nThis issue is following #6950\nThe fix works on IE11. Unfortunately, it doesn't under Edge.\n\nIt seems that Edge is implementing innerHTML property on SVG tag, but in an inefficient way. Using it appends SVG text in the DOM tree, as it can be seen using the inspector, but Edge doesn't render anything... Unless you modify the svg string in the inspector...\n\nSee the [codepen](http://codepen.io/lgra/pen/OXPgoQ) (updated to use React 15.3) under Edge to see that issue.\n\nOf course, if we enforce Edge to use the hack, it works. I don't know how to enforce it except browser sniffing (grr...).\n",
