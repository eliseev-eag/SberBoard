  "body": "I've just discovered that _stateless components_ aren't pure. You can do:\n\n``` jsx\nconst Clock = () => <div>{moment().format('HH:mm:ss')}</div>\n```\n\nand it works very well as long as the parent component is rerendered often enough.\n\nI think by publishing unpure stateless components in `v0.14`, you lost a good opportunity to teach the community to write fast, pure components. After so many talks where you've mentioned how cool and powerful the principles of immutable data is, I must say I'm dissapointed that you keep adding functionality to React that allows people to write what I think is sloppy code.\n\nBut it looks like stateless components still is a undocumented feature. The only official place I can find infromation about it, is in the release article in the blog. Could it be possible to change the behaviour of stateless components and make them pure in a later release?\n\nIf not: then I would really like another way to write pure, stateless functions. That will probably be something like:\n\n``` jsx\nconst Clock = ({ currentTime }) => <div>{currentTime.format('HH:mm:ss')}</div>;\nClock.isPure = true;\n```\n",
