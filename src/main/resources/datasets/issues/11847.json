  "body": "**Feature request**\r\nWe need to have a way to build the initial state of ReactComponent in case of usage of classes.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWarning in case this.state modified in willComponentMount.\r\n\r\nAccess to partially constructed object in case of somewhat complex state building logic in the constructor.\r\n\r\nFor example, if we have a hierarchy of classes with the _buildState method called in the constructor to generate an initial state.\r\nDerived class overrides the _buildState method to have a richer state. In result, part of the object related to the derived class won't be constructed yet and can't be accessed in the _buildState.\r\n\r\nThe buildState approach is currently used in ReSub framework:\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/ReSub\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nRather no warning in case of this.state modification or new Lifecycle method which is called right after constructor call which returns the state.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16+ is affected.\r\n",
