  "body": "### Bug:\n\nWhen React renders a component with invalid props, it logs a warning.\nIf the same named component is rendered again, with the same invalid props, there is no warning.\n### Demonstration:\n\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/x5b9u8ow/2/\n### Why it's an issue for me:\n\nWhen I am testing my react components with jasmine, karma and webpack all components end up being referred to as `t` (I am not 100% sure why).\nThis means that when I am testing propType validation, subsequent tests that have different components with the same named prop will not log warnings.\n",
