  "body": "I am having an issue with text based inputs in React 0.14.3 and React DOM 0.14.3. When the `onChange` event is fired for an input, the input will be deselected.\n\nHere is what this looks like in the UI: \n![wtf](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3857324/11430565/413317be-944e-11e5-9688-65b1330d252c.gif)\n\nHere is an example [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/xowixu/edit?js,console) of my components. \n\nThere is a `<Form />` top-level component, which describes the fields on the form. This component also holds the state of the form and is the only component that extends `React.Component`.  For each field in the form, there is a `<Field />` child component—which each has a `<Label />` and `<Input />` child. The form also has one `<Submit />` component, which, when clicked, will fire an `onSubmit` function with the state of the form. With the exception of `<Form />`, these components are all stateless functional components.\n\nThe `<Input />` components are controlled. They get their value from the top level form component. The state is properly updated in this top level after the `onChange` event is fired—as you would expect things to typically work with a controlled form. This state is then passed down via props to the input.\n\nI've been trying to figure out what could possibly be the cause of this weird deselection issue, but haven't made any progress... any ideas? Thanks.\n",
