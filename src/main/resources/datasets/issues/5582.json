  "body": "Not sure if this is intended or not, but I didn't see anything in the documentation about it.\n\nWhen using react-dom, it requires import of react even if react itself is never required. For example, in our project we have a backbone shim view that we use merely to render the page component:\n\n```\nReactDOM.render(<SomePage/>, this.el);\n```\n\nNo react-specific transform occurs on the page, however this fails because React is not available. I assume the problem here is the fact React.createElement is needed for the conversion from JSX to JS. While deduceable, this is not very intuitive. Also, this causes linters to fail on the import of React without actually using it anywhere. In both cases, I imagine not desirable behavior.\n\nAny recommendations? I think at bare minimum this should be called out explicitly somewhere (and apologies if it already is and I just missed it).\n",
