  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nA bug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nUsing `<Suspense />` & `lazy` to lazy load components triggers the following warning:\r\n```\r\nWarning: Functions are not valid as a React child. This may happen if you return a Component instead of <Component /> from render. Or maybe you meant to call this function rather than return it.\r\n```\r\nIt does however not affect functionality at all and the lazy loading & rendering of the component works fine.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/mjzj27m0j8\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nNot trigger the warning as this should be a valid way of loading & rendering components [according to the documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html?no-cache=1#reactlazy).\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n`react@16.6.0`\r\n`react-dom@16.6.0`\r\n`react-scripts@2.0.3`",
