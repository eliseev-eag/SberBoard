  "body": "If we make `key` default to the value of `ref` if specified (plus some prefix to avoid conflicts perhaps), it seems to me like it would be a reconciliation win (`key: null` could be used to prevent this behavior, if it was ever needed).\n\nThe only practical difference it should make is if `<input ref=\"a\" />` is replaced by `<input ref=\"b\" />` it will now recreate the element instead of reusing it. To me that actually seems like another win, that's the behavior I would really want if that would happen and I can't think of a scenario where I wouldn't actually want that behavior.\n\nI mentioned it briefly to @vjeux and it seemed reasonable to him at least. :)\n",
