  "body": "Right now we have some inconsistencies which requires cognitive load.\n\nWith the exception of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, I don't think there's ever any reason not to allow any sort of type as a prop in the DOM. Otherwise, `{false}` should put \"false\" in the DOM, `{{foo: 'bar'}}` should put \"[object Object]\".\n\nWe still want to special case `null`/`undefined` as those indicate that we should empty the value. Otherwise, `'' + prop` will ensure that we call `toString()` on the object (so you could have a custom Person object if you want).\n\nThis shouldn't be terriblely hard to fix, but we do want to make sure we test the change thoroughly. It will be a breaking change in some specific cases (mostly forms), so we'll also need to communicate this clearly.\n\nTangentially, we'll be inconsistent with the way types work as children. For example `<div>{false}</div>` doesn't have a child with \"false\" as text. We need to do something for children due to the fact that we use objects and arrays as special indicators for mapping.\n",
