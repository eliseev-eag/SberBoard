  "body": "The bug is extremely weird and I'm not sure whether it's `useClickOutside` broken or React.\r\nReproduce CodeSandox is here: https://codesandbox.io/s/lr668rr94m\r\n\r\nLong story short. I want to handle some logic only when something is `inProgress` if it's not in progress no state changes should happen.\r\nBut when this actual thing is indeed `inProgress` (has a `true` value) in `render` scope it's actually `true` while in callback it somehow appears to be still `false`.\r\n\r\nI watched the code of `useClickOutside` and there is no `useCallback` involved to cause such issue, so I assume it can be some issue with React itself.\r\n\r\nI also opened an issue in the repo:\r\nhttps://github.com/sandiiarov/use-events/issues/35\r\n\r\nPlease check its source code here:\r\nhttps://github.com/sandiiarov/use-events/blob/master/src/useClickOutside/index.tsx",
