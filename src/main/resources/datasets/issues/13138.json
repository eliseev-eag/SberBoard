  "body": "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm running a small project on GatsbyJS, using **Redux** to manage shared state values between multiple components across the React DOM tree.\r\n\r\nWith the release of the new Context API, I'm thinking about replacing Redux (which is a bit overkill for this project). I made some tests, and it's working really fine in runtime.\r\n\r\nHowever, I cannot build the project via server-side rendering. The context seems to be `undefined`. I made a lot of searches on the web about this issue, but there is not so much informations about this (probably because of its young age).\r\n\r\n[The only issue that - I think - is related is from next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/4194) (that is a static website generator aswell). But they don't have any solution neither.\r\n\r\n**=> Is this new Context API compatible with SSR? Do you have any resources / examples about this?**",
