  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nReport a bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nError and warning when trying to dynamically `lazy` load a component from a variable or props.\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning: Critical dependency: the request of a dependency is an expression\r\n\r\nError: Cannot find module './Button'\r\n(anonymous function)\r\n.../dynamic-lazy-load/src lazy groupOptions: {} namespace object:5\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Reproduction**\r\nIn a Codesandbox it seems to be working https://codesandbox.io/s/angry-rgb-vs0g4 fine. For some reason in a non codesandboxed environment, I was able to reproduce the issue [here](https://github.com/ReasonableDeveloper/react-dynamic-lazy-load-bug).\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt should lazily load the component even when the path is passed down via props or stored in a variable without throwing a warning or error. The behavior of following code:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nconst buttonPath = \"./Button\";\r\nconst LazyLoadedButton = lazy(() => import(buttonPath));\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould match the behavior of\r\n```JavaScript\r\nconst LazyLoadedButton = lazy(() => import('./Button'));\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nLatest version of CRA (3.0.1) and latest React (16.8.6)\r\n\r\nThis issue was first reported in the lerna support CRA pull request seen [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6599#issuecomment-511161680).",
