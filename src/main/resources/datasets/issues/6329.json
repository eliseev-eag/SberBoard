  "body": "Example:\n\n```\nconst MyComponent = (text) => {\n  <p>{text}</p>\n}\n```\n\nThat component will not throw any errors, nor will it ever actually render. It's a silly error to make, but I think a warning in cases like these is called for. \"WARNING: Incorrect Usage in MyComponent, see return statement of MyComponent\"\n\nFWIW: the correct code:\n\n```\nconst MyComponent = (text) => (\n  <p>{text}</p>\n)\n```\n\nSee how easy that is to miss?\n\nNot sure how difficult something like this is to figure out. Going to continue looking myself, but if someone has some idea how to go about creating a warning for this scenario, please feel free to point me in the right direction :smile:  \n",
