  "body": "Per conversations with @petehunt in IRC, this PR adds a new `nextUpdate(component, callback)` method in ReactTestUtils.\n\nThis is a convenience method for adding an additional, one-time `componentDidUpdate` method to a component. It's useful for testing components that are updated asynchronously from outside data sources (such as components that fetch data through AJAX). For example, if you had a component that changed a value that was updated asynchronously, you might test in Mocha it with something like:\n\n``` js\nit('updates the value of input.foo with the current state.value', function(done) {\n  expect(1);\n\n  ReactTestUtils.nextUpdate(component, function() {\n    expect(component.getDOMNode().querySelector('input.foo').value).to.be(expected);\n    done();  // (mocha-style async callback)\n  });\n\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    component.setState({value: expected});\n  }, 10);\n});\n```\n\nInternally, this creates a new `chainedFunction` like a mixin would, but resets `componentDidUpdate` back to its initial value after the callback was called.\n",
