  "body": "\"appear\" differs from \"enter\" in that all children of a transition group at mount time will \"appear\" but will not \"enter\". All children later added to an existing transition group will \"enter\" but not \"appear\".\n\nThis extra transition phase allows for animation-on-mount effects.\n\nA mirroring \"appear\" prop has been added to ReactCSSTransitionGroup, however for reverse-compatibility (and because \"appear\" is less common) it defaults to false.\n\nThanks to @appsforartists for his work investigating the possible ways to implement this.\n",
