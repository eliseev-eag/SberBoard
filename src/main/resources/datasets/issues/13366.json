  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nConsider a `<select>` with options from external data, say, \"A\" and \"B\". Users could choose an option, say, \"B\". Since data are from outside, it's possible that later the option \"B\" is no longer an option. The `<select>` will automatically adjust its display to a left option which is \"A\" in this case. Yet, `onChange` is not triggered. This means unless users click on `<select>` and choose the option that is already displayed (which doesn't make sense at all), the internal state of the `<select>` wouldn't be able to change to the correct perceived value.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/zLevVV\r\n\r\nI simulate the external data by having an input text which is a comma-separated choices. Try the following sequences of events:\r\n\r\n1. Select option \"B\" in the `<select>` element.\r\n2. Edit the text box so that its value is changed from `A,B` to `A`.\r\n3. The displayed value is now \"A\", but the current choice in the internal state is still \"B\".\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n`onChange` is triggered, and the internal state is adjusted to \"A\".\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.4, Chrome/Firefox",
