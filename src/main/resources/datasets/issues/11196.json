Well... I don't see any case where a function should live inside the state. \r\n\r\nI saw a lot of posts on StakOverflow about putting Components or Functions on the Redux global State. It might be the same conception. \r\n\r\nI want to create a PR in order to address this warning only on development.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n",
