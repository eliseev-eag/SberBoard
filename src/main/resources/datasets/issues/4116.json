  "body": "The React API and documentation give some mixed messages about whether or not \"state\" is safe to read from externally.\n\nIn code, you can call \"component.state\" to figure out what a Component's State is. This is useful in several situations, but it's particularly valuable when writing unit tests.\n\nBy javascript convention, I would believe this is a public variable. If I weren't supposed to read from it, I would expect it to be called \"_state\".\n\n...but in the documentation, it doesn't appear in the Component API, or any of the examples. It's not used in the Jest examples either.\n\n\"component.props\" is in a very similar situation... although I admit that this one is much less useful, since it doesn't come up as frequently in unit tests.\n\nI can imagine a few ways to make this clearer, depending on the React team's intentions.\n\nIf you intend for them to be public:\n- Add them to the public Component API\n- Use them in some of your official examples\n\nIf you don't intend for them to be public:\n- Ideally, you could do some trickery with closures inside React.render(), so that the input to React.createClass() can touch these variables, but the object returned by React.render() doesn't expose them.\n- Barring that, it'd help if the names started with an underscore, so engineers would know that they're private\n",
