I proposed building an api in enzyme to get hook state through it (See https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/issues/2120\r\n). So I'd like to know when React core team will publish this. Or at least, to make sure if we can safely use that module in the future, through npm package or devtool hook.\r\n\r\nAlso I'd like to leverage the `overrideHookState` api injected into devtool to set hook stat in enzyme. I'd like to ask:\r\n\r\n1. Is it possible to put this into `react-debug-tools`?\r\n2. If not, is it safe (i.e. react will not drop or change `overrideHookState` api easily)for a third party user(not react nor react-devtool) to use it through building a custom devtool hook(So react will inject it into enzyme)?\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI hope `react-debug-tools` published soon and `overrideHookState` can be included. Or at least I'd like to know if build a custom devtool hook to get `overrideHookState` is safe or not.\r\n\r\nI know some people would think it's not a good testing strategy to get / set hook state directly. But I think it's still valuable to be able to do that in some cases.\r\n\r\nAlso cc @ljharb ",
