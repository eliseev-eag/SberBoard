  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThere is a bug in the Create-react-app CLI.\r\nCurrently if you use and old package.json that has the : react-scripts: ^3.1.1 version. \r\nand you run npm i and then try to rum the site (npm start) you get the following error:\r\n\r\n“Definition for rule '@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-assertions' was not found”\r\n\r\nI solved this by deleting the node_module entirely, then I updated my package.json file to use the \"react-scripts: 3.1.2\" version. then i run the npm i again, and it fixed the issue.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the new create-react-app doesn't backward support the react-scripts: 3.1.1 version.\r\n\r\nPlease check this ASAP since I already see posts in StackOverflow, meaning a lot of people are going to encounter this issue.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
