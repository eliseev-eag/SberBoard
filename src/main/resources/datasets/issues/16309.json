  "body": "How can one tell if the `component` being passed is `ref`-able?\r\nThere was a way to tell a function from a class:\r\nhttps://overreacted.io/how-does-react-tell-a-class-from-a-function/\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/**\r\n * Checks if the argument is a React.Component class.\r\n * https://overreacted.io/how-does-react-tell-a-class-from-a-function/\r\n * @param  {any}  Component\r\n * @return {boolean}\r\n */\r\nfunction isComponentClass(Component) {\r\n\t// return Component.prototype instanceof React.Component\r\n\treturn Component.prototype.isReactComponent\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut now there're also `React.memo()` that has `.prototype === undefined` and `React.forwardRef()` that can be passed a `ref` but also has `.prototype === undefined`.\r\n\r\nWhat's the simplest way of telling if `ref` could be passed to a component without having React complaining about it?",
