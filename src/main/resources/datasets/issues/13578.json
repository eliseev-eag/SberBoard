  "body": "Hi,\r\nI am creating a react app using create-react-app. I have some external javascript libraries for template design in main index.html\r\n\r\n```\r\n<script src=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/js/jquery-2.2.4.min.js\"></script>\r\n <script src=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/js/common_scripts.js\"></script>\r\n <script src=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/js/main.js\"></script>\r\n <script src=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/js/owl.carousel.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\nThese JS files are working on first page when the application gets started. But these libraries are not working when redirect to other page from first page. From what I understand, these files are rendering but their functions, variables, and methods are not accessible when the route is changed. I am using react-router-dom v4 for routing .\r\n\r\nI googled it and found a solution- To render the JS libraries by ComponentDidMount() method\r\n\r\n```\r\nComponentDidMount(){\r\n    loadjs('./js/main.js', function(){\r\n    loadjs('./js/common_scripts.js)\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut even this solution is not working. Please help to solve this issue.\r\n\r\nThanks",
