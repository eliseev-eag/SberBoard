  "body": "I just experienced really confusing errors that were happening because of an old component I wrote that was dispatching Redux actions during its `componentWillUpdate`.  The docs only warn that we can't call `setState` during `componentWillUpdate`, but I assume that causing component updates by any other means is likewise a bad idea, so I want to warn other devs about it in the official docs.",
