  "body": "This PR adds support for React Flare to React Native (Fabric only).\r\n\r\nThis includes much of the core work that was already done for ReactDOM's responder system. In fact much of it is copied – but I'm going to leave that intentionally copied for now. We can unify the shared logic in a follow up – but in order not to conflict with existing work on ReactDOM, it's separate for now.\r\n\r\nI've also included a Flare version of the Press responder that works after doing some internal testing on iOS and Android with Fabric.\r\n\r\nI'll also add tests for Press in a follow up, but first wanted to get the scaffolding implementation in without making this PR huge.",
