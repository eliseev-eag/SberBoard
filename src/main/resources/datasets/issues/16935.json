  "body": "If an increased priority dehydrated boundary commits as dehydrated because it is suspended, it no longer has any `expirationTime` scheduled. So when the thenable resolves, it gets the default priority. This increases the `retryTime`. This will almost immediately expire and effectively become sync. We might want to make this slightly higher than Normal but longer expiration time.\r\n\r\nThe upside of eagerly computing this (as opposed to when resolved) is that we can guarantee a predictable order of priorities. (First event in, highest pri.)\r\n\r\nThis PR also ensures that we increase the priority of subsequent events after the first can't be done synchronously. There's no reason to keep them as high as sync since at that point it is already too late since replaying has kicked in. So we schedule with user blocking pri for this case.",
