  "body": "It seems like every time I go to look up the React.JS docs they're out of date, which has become pretty troublesome for me and my team. We have pretty much given up on referring to the documentation that resides on the site because of how unreliable and incomplete it has proven to be.\n\nBecause of this, much of our time spent on work has been struggling to figure things out on our own. This can be understandable for new libraries sometimes, but when the team developing the project is looking for other developers to take this and run with it, it would behoove them to keep the documentation up to date so that the developers testing it out or trying to work with it can adequately develop using it.\n\nI do not have the time or energy to compile an exhaustive list of issues or outdated areas of your documentation, but one such example is the [`Top-Level API` documentation page](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html) whose contents are [either deprecated or out dated](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/docs/docs/ref-01-top-level-api.md).\n\nMethods like `React.render()`, `React.renderToString()`, and `React.renderToStaticMarkup()` have all changed since then as per the [changelog posted by Paul O'Shannessy here](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/10/28/react-v0.12.html)\n\nIt's very hard to continue to develop when the main toolset that is being used has outdated documentation that references. Many developers out side our team share the same sentiment, that much of the documentation is very lacking.\n\nWe're trying to take what you guys have built and build some kick-ass web apps using React.JS! Help us out! :smile: \n",
