  "body": "Upgraded to React 15rc1 today, and a new warning appears to have cropped up:\n\n```\nWarning: SearchBox is changing a uncontrolled input of type text to be controlled. Input elements should not switch from uncontrolled to controlled (or viceversa). Decide between using a controlled or uncontrolled input element for the lifetime of the component. More info: https://fb.me/react-controlled-components\n```\n\nThe component it's referring to is indeed a controlled component for the duration of its lifetime:\n\n``` js\n<input\n  type=\"text\"\n  className=\"typeahead\"\n  onKeyUp={::this.controlsHandler}\n  onChange={::this.changeHandler}\n  value={this.props.search.get('term')}\n  ref={(i) => this._input = i}\n/>\n```\n\nThe problem, I've realized, is that on first render, `this.props.search.get('term')` returns `undefined`, because its value is only populated with text put into the input.\n\nI expect this is a pretty common pattern for controlled components?\n\nOtherwise loving the release - having all SVG attributes at my disposal is very exciting :)\n",
