Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nWhen using `key={Symbol('myKeySymbol')}` we get the following `TypeError: Cannot convert a Symbol value to a string at Object.ReactElement.createElement`\r\n\r\n[codesandbox here](https://codesandbox.io/s/733pypz57j)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nUsing `Symbols` as keys should work seamlessly, in my opinion element keys are a perfect use-case for `Symbols`.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nUsing React `16.0.0` and the browsers affected are Safari, Chrome and Firefox on OSX, but I'm pretty sure this is not browser dependent but a matter of implementation.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n",
