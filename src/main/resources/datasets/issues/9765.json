  "body": "Right now 'React' is undefined in some of our addons which may depend on it:\r\n- [create-class](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/15-stable/addons/create-react-class/create-react-class.js#L764) (documented in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9689)\r\n - [create-fragment](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/15-stable/addons/react-addons-create-fragment/react-addons-create-fragment.js#L11)\r\n - [react-linked-input](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/15-stable/addons/react-linked-input/react-linked-input.js#L1)\r\n\r\nThe problem: running these in an AMD environment without React defined globally will lead to the dependency not being found.\r\n\r\nProbably this can be solved as follows:\r\n1. Manually edit the unminified version, making it work like `react-dom`:\r\n![18697850_420365161667842_787782393_o](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1114467/26412833/ddcbf8ee-405e-11e7-9a0d-bdd138d8aa84.png)\r\n2. Test by modify requirejs or systemjs fixtures as one-offs to test it specifically. This doesn't need to be committed.\r\n3. Submit a PR and a React Core maintainer will rebuild the minified version for you - this is not a process we had intended to repeat so it is not automated in an easy way to reproduce. tag @flarnie and/or @gaearon \r\n\r\nIdeally we are not making changes to the `addons` code, but this is worth doing. If someone wants to work on this I'm happy to review PRs, otherwise will pick it up in the next couple of days.\r\n",
