  "body": "This extends https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/14608 to direct `readContext` calls and adds tests. It turned out it's not super easy.\r\n\r\nI started by directing Dispatcher's `readContext` to `FiberHooks` implementation so that we can check `currentlyRenderingFiber` (which https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/14608 temporarily resets before calling user code from Hooks). But then I realized `currentlyRenderingFiber` is also `null` for classes and context consumers from which it's legit to `readContext()`.\r\n\r\nI struggled a bit but then noticed we already rely on `renderExpirationTime` (per comment) to tell whether we're in a Hook-capable component or not. So I used that too, and only throw if `renderExpirationTime !== NoWork` (we’re using Hooks) and `currentlyRenderingFiber === null` (we’ve stepped into the user code).\r\n\r\nWhile I was there, I also removed unnecessary `FiberBeginWork -> CurrentDispatcher -> readContext` indirection in favor of a direct call, as  `FiberBeginWork` itself is our own code.\r\n\r\nThis PR is client-side only. I started looking into SSR but I think there might be more warts there and I want to do it separately.",
