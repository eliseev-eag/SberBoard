  "body": "React 16.8.6, also updated to 16.9.0 â€” same behavior.\r\nSomewhere deep in the component tree there's a component that renders a `<button/>`.\r\nOn the first run it renders it with one `style`, on a subsequent second run it renders it with another `style`.\r\nI placed a `console.log(style)` there and I can see that when the `style` property is updated the corresponding console line is there.\r\nStill, the actual DOM node for the `<button style={style}/>` is not updated (I can see the previous `style` attribute in the Inspector).\r\nIt is updated only if I \"kick\" the component to re-render manually.\r\nCan this even be possible?\r\nIf you have no ideas then I'll close this issue.",
