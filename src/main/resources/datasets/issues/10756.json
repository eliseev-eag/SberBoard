  "body": "Hello! Really love new features and architecture of Fiber.\r\n\r\nBut because of this new behavior:\r\n> **Non-event attributes with function values**:\r\n> React 16: Warns and ignores them.\r\n\r\nI've got this issue:\r\n```jsx\r\nconst fn = () => null;\r\nfn.toString = () => 'foo';\r\n\r\nconst render = () => (\r\n  <div className={fn}>doesn't add class</div>\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't add className, even if i've override `toString` method, but with object it works:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst obj = { toString: () => 'foo' };\r\n\r\nconst render = () => (\r\n  <div className={obj}>works</div>\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it's OK to have same behavior with function and object.\r\nThis feature is needed in \"bem-cn\" like library, so I can write just `fn`, instead of `fn()` or `fn.toString()`\r\n",
