  "body": "I've been playing around with React 16.6.0 recently and I love the idea of React Memo, but I've been unable to find anything regarding scenarios best suited to implement it. The React docs (https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo) don't seem to suggest any implications from just throwing it on all of your functional components. Because it does a shallow comparison to figure out if it needs to re-render, **is there ever going to be a situation that negatively impacts performance**?\r\n\r\nAnd second question: as long as everything remains pure, is there ever a situation to not wrap a functional component with React Memo?\r\n\r\nThank you.",
