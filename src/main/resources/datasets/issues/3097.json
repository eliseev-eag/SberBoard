  "body": "Eslint now allows us to use a different parser, which allows us to use\nesprima-fb explicitly. This means we don't have to wait for espree to add\nthings like rest-param parsing. Though we do need eslint to upgrade its rules\nto handle that AST.\n\nI had hoped to enable parsing of our tests but we can't do that until we\nchange esprima-fb's XJS nodes to JSX.\n\nWhile I was here, I also enabled the no-unused-vars rule since eslint\nunderstands template strings. I also made the single quote enforcement\nactually fail instead of just warn.\n",
