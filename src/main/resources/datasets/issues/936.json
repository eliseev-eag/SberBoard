  "body": "I went through the code and normalized some code style inconsistencies, primarily:\n1. `Var === undefined` wherever possible, it's shorter and looks like any other comparison (`typeof Var === 'undefined'` sure doesn't), any misuse of `undefined` during development should be immediately apparent as we rely on `strict` in every file (and it would be a major bug regardless, if we can crash earlier = great).\n2. As far as I'm aware, the recommendation for Javascript is to use `===` unless you explicitly want to use `==`. I don't see any reason not to follow it.\n3. We rely on `{key: undefined}` a bit internally as an optimization and it's reasonable to expect others to do the same. Unless we explicitly intend to use `in`, I'm pretty sure what we meant was `!== undefined` (for edge-cases). So lets use `!== undefined`.\n\nFeel free to object to some or all of it.\n\n```\n   raw     gz Compared to master @ 4b392f19a88b099f25f99978a40851c9b5aa0b50\n     =      = build/JSXTransformer.js\n     =      = build/react-test.js\n   -58    -50 build/react-with-addons.js\n   -65    -17 build/react-with-addons.min.js\n   -59    -47 build/react.js\n   -65    -11 build/react.min.js\n```\n",
