Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n```\r\nconst someVar = 'foo';\r\n\r\nconst htmlWithVariableAndCharacters = document.createTextNode(\r\n  ReactDOMServer.renderToString(\r\n    <div>{someVar}anyCharacters</div>\r\n  )\r\n);\r\n\r\ndocument.body.appendChild(htmlWithVariableAndCharacters);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHTML Output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div data-reactroot=\"\">foo<!-- -->anyCharacters</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee it live here: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/mvORKd?editors=0010\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nExpected HTML output:\r\n```\r\n<div data-reactroot=\"\">fooanyCharacters</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nSeen in React 16.7.0, do not know behavior in previous versions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSomething to keep in mind is if you open Chrome Development Tools you will not be able to see these HTML comments as Chrome strips them from being viewed in the developer pane. They can be seen in a server side render string output or if you right-click and choose 'Copy Element' and paste into a text editor.\r\n",
