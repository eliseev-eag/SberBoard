  "body": "We've had a huge number of issues come in here and in the tutorial repo about inconsistencies and confusing parts, especially when it sort of works fine without a server initially and then requires it half way through. We've talked about maybe rewriting it entirely and maybe we will, but in the mean time we should clean it up and make it easier for people to learn React without getting tripped up\n\nAny ideas are welcome, especially from people on the front lines (mailing list, IRC, Slack, Stack Overflow, GitHub)\n\nA couple ideas:\n- Provide a running API server that people can use (probably with a randomly generated API key to make sure people have their own clean environment)\n- ~~Just require a local server from the beginning~~ Done!\n- Remove the `tutorialN.js` bit\n- Paginate so that steps are separated better\n",
