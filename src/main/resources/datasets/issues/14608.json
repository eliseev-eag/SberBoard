  "body": "This PR adds a flag to 'pause' hooks while they're running, so we can throw an error whenever a hook is called inside 2 spots - useMemo's nextCreate function, and React.memo's comparison function. \r\nIt's a bit icky, but wanted to confirm the approach with you. \r\n\r\n- need to add a test for verifying you can't useContext in the same scenarios \r\n- Need to add the same logic to the PartialRenderer\r\n\r\nI could also rename pauseHooks to something more explicit, like pauseHooksWhileComparingMemos",
