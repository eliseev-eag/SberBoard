  "body": "This fixes a crash that only occurs in react-dom 16.4.1.\r\n\r\nsetTimeout and clearTimeout may not be available in some server-render environments (such as ChakraCore in React.NET), and loading ReactScheduler.js will cause a crash unless the existence of the variables are checked via a typeof comparison.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/555\r\n\r\nThe crash did not occur in 16.4.0, and the change appears to have been introduced here: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12931/files#diff-bbebc3357e1fb99ab13ad796e04b69a6L47\r\n\r\nI tested this by using yarn link and running it with a local copy of React.NET. I am unsure the best way to unit test this change, since assigning null to `setTimeout` causes an immediate crash within the Node REPL.",
