  "body": "`<input type='number' defaultValue={someValue}/>` does not work correctly in Chrome. When user type in a decimal point `.`, the point will disappear and the caret will be be reset to the beginning of the input. If you keep typing in `.` twice, the value of input will disappear. However, if a input has no defaultValue, it seems to work fine. \n\nI've put together a fiddle page to demo the bug: https://jsfiddle.net/sc3wpujs/2/\n\nI think it has something to do with the internal state management of an uncontrolled component. When the first `.` is typed, it does not get to `target.value` (chrome may have trimmed the \"unnecessary\" `.` from the value because it's type is `number`). React pushing `target.value` back to input causing the `.` to disappear and caret position reset. Now if two `.` are typed in, the value is no longer a valid number and Chrome may return `''` for `target.value`, causing the input to be reset.\n",
