  "body": "This is part tech-debt cleanup, since the dispatcher didn't really belong in the owner ref to begin with.\r\n\r\nAlso this will be used by the DevTools to support hooks. DevTools need a way to modify the current dispatcher, so renderers will need to inject this ref at runtime.\r\n\r\nNote that external libraries depending on React internals may be impacted by this, but [there are migration strategies involving feature detection](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/14548#issuecomment-452448465) and in general, we don't really support accessing the internals data structure.",
