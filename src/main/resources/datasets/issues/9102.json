  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug-ish\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen doing server-side rendering with React, requiring `react-dom` (which transitively requires `ReactDOMFrameScheduling.js`) throws an exception because rAF is not defined.\r\n\r\n```\r\nInvariant Violation: React depends on requestAnimationFrame. Make sure that you load a polyfill in older browsers.\r\n    at invariant (app/node_modules/fbjs/lib/invariant.js:44:15)\r\n    at Object.<anonymous> (app/node_modules/react-dom/lib/ReactDOMFrameScheduling.js:30:3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can happen if you have a universal component that has top-level imports of client-side libraries, like `react-router-scroll`, that require `react-dom` instead of `react-dom/server`.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI would expect not to get this error unless requestAnimationFrame were actually called. Ex: lazily check for rAF and define rIC.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16.0.0-alpha.3 on Node 7.7.1. This started happening in alpha 3, which shipped and enabled Fiber.\r\n",
