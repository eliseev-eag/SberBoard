  "body": "hi,\n\nWe're using react to build out views in the atom editor. Because atom is an app running production mode, react won't give us proper invariant errors. Looking through the code there were hundreds of checks to see if the code was running the production environment, so it didn't look trivial to add a pull request for this. I did a search replace for \"production\" -> \"development\" and started to get the errors I wanted. \n\nI know we're a special case, but this will come up for any system where you use react in a plugin when the surrounding app is in production mode.\n\nI will look at seeing if I can make atom not run in production mode, but it this feels like something react should support rather than atom to support running a production app in development mode.\n\nThanks for your time,\nFrancois\n",
