  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\n\nIt's more of a bug -- I don't think this behaviour should occur, but it's not a problem in production.\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\n\nWarning appears.\n\n> Warning: Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique \"key\" prop. Check the render method of `List`. See https://fb.me/react-warning-keys for more information.\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\n\n[Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/mnpenner/w42jkebb/1/). I'll paste the code here too, just in case:\n\n``` html\n<script src=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/js/jsfiddle-integration-babel.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/15.1.0/react-dom-server.min.js\"></script>\n\n<div id=\"container\">\n    <!-- This element's contents will be replaced with your component. -->\n</div>\n```\n\n``` jsx\nfunction List(props) {\n    return <ul>\n    {props.items.map(x => <li>{x}</li>)}\n  </ul>\n}\n\nlet listItems = [...Array(10).keys()];\n\ndocument.getElementById('container').innerHTML = ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup(<List items={listItems}/>);\n```\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n\nNo warning.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\nFiddle uses React 15.0.1. Tested in Chrome on Ubuntu. I didn't test previous versions of React, but I suspect it's always been this way.\n\n**Notes**\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, the HTML generated via `renderToStaticMarkup` cannot be updated by React because the essential DOM attributes are stripped away. This means that `key`s should not be necessary because React will never need to match up the elements during a re-render. Supplying `key`s that will never be used just to avoid a warning is tedious. Ergo, warning should be suppressed when JSX is rendered via `renderToStaticMarkup`.\n",
