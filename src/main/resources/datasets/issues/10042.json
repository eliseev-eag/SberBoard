  "body": "**BUG:** can't type in standard (controlled) `<input>` on IE10\r\n(this works just fine on IE11!)\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:** Okay I now know where the problem lies: It has something to do with [cheton/react-sortable](https://github.com/cheton/react-sortable). the input I am talking about here is inside an `<li>` in a `SortableList`. When I deactivate this, the input focus and caret works!\r\n\r\nControlled component with proper `value` and `onChange`.\r\nThe weird thing is, that the input does **not lose its focus** (can be seen because it is still white and the border is there - CSS `input:focus` is 'active'), but the caret simply immediately disappears.\r\nEven more weird is, that the parent node has an onClick, which basically just does `this. amountInput.focus()` and **this works**. The caret shows up, I can type, all is fine. but directly clicking into the input, the caret immediately disappears.\r\n\r\nPlease [check the video](http://jmp.sh/6vX3OKp).\r\n\r\nDid anyone ever experience this? I already tried removing all my Blur, Keydown, whatever handlers and all that from the input, but nothing changed at all.\r\nSo I am basically now down to a simple controlled input, with a `value` and a `onChange` handler. \r\n```\r\n<input\r\n   ref={(input) => { this.amountInput = input }}\r\n   className=\"amount-input\"\r\n   type=\"number\"\r\n   placeholder=\"Menge\"\r\n   onChange={(e) => this.changeAmount('change', e)}\r\n   value={amount}\r\n/>\r\n```\r\nSidenote: my `onChange` does not \"save into state\", but rather into a client Meteor [`minimongo`](https://guide.meteor.com/collections.html) database.\r\nBut again, it works just fine on any other browser, including IE11.\r\nI don't get it.\r\n\r\nMost recent React Version, IE10 in Win7 VM on MacOS.\r\n",
