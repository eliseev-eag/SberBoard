  "body": "The issue [#1478](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1478) was fixed by [pull #2549](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/2549). And from the comments it seems works. But now I meet the same problem with the latest stable edition 0.13. \n\nI write a [todo list](http://jsfiddle.net/foolyoghurt/42uyzs2k/) with react and use ReactCSSTransitionGroup to do some animation. However, when I use `clear completed` button to delete all the completed todo items, only the last item will be deleted just as [issue #1478](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1478) mentioned. And if I don't use `transitionLeave={false}` on ReactCSSTransitionGroup everything works fine.\n\nI see in the [ReactTransitionGroup.js](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/addons/transitions/ReactTransitionGroup.js#L178-L201) some [code committed](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/2549/files) to fix this problem has been **removed** and so does the test case! I wonder what happened.\n",
