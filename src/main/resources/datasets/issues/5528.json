  "body": "This is an attempt at fixing #2461\n\nIf a Component's `render()` function throws an error we catch it, display a warning in the console and then we throw the error using `setTimeout` so that React does not get into inconsistent state but the error is not swallowed and bubbles to the top.\n\nPlease let us know if this is the right direction. We are really not sure about the usage of `setTimeout`, it feels like a dirty hack. The reason for its usage is to not silently fail but to let the error propagate to the top. But we cannot do it synchronously because otherwise React will end up in state that is \"beyond repair\".\n\nWe worked on this PR together with @LeZuse\n\nSee the test case here: http://jsfiddle.net/XeeD/pLqphjm4/\n",
