  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nfeature\r\n\r\n1. css. I love react, but can't help notice vue components does this one thing better. writing css the way css looks, same syntax, and more importantly having access to all css properties. It looks elegant and simple,\r\njust \r\n```\r\n<style> .... normal css here </style>\r\n```\r\n and you create module css. Why can't react have such feature? Every solution I knows has invented its own syntax and walk-around.\r\n\r\n2. Recently I learned it isn't obvious to bind a event handler with argument, and be performant at the same time. \r\n\r\n```js\r\narr.map(item => <li onClick={() => this.handleClick(item.id, item.isComplete) } />)\r\n```\r\nSeems to be the most natural way to pass in arguments to event handler, but this way will create a new function every time the component renders, and possibly damage performance. All the alternative I know seems less apparent, as you are supposed to\r\n ```js\r\narr.map(item => <li onClick={ this.handleClick } />)\r\n```\r\nbind this way and try to pass the arguments some other ways. Is there a good way to solve this?\r\n",
