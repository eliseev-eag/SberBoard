  "body": "# Suggestion: Do not merge\r\n\r\n### Backstory\r\n\r\nWe currently have two \"profilers\" - DevTools visual Profiler (similar to the browser's built in profiler) and `React.Profiler`. It's easy to confuse these two, especially since the DevTools Profiler makes use of the profiling API code. It seems like the profiler API could have a better name though.\r\nThe current two use cases it serves:\r\n\r\n1. Count the number of times a subtree commits (in DEV or PROD).\r\n2. Record the time spent a subtree (in PROD).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the second metric (time spent) isn't all that useful in Concurrent/Batched modes because we reset counters in the case of interruptions or suspends (depending on where the `<React.Profiler>` node is relative to the nearest boundary).\r\n\r\nIt seems likely that a new API (#15727) may better serve the needs of complex apps using these new APIs. So far as I know, the new events would not be coupled with the `<React.Profiler>` API but would be exposed via something new.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nGiven this, we discussed potential new names on the team and the one that had the most support was `SubtreeProfiler`.\r\n\r\nHowever, after looking closer at what would be involved in this rename- I am no longer sure it's worth the effort, given all of the places we would need to change:\r\n\r\n* We have already released a stable version of `react-is` with `Profiler` and `isProfiler` exports, so we'll need to keep those around until v17.\r\n* This also impacts DevTools since it would have to continue to support the old `Symbol.for('react.profiler')`.\r\n\r\n### Overall, I like this name _better_ but I'm not convinced that it's _enough better_ to warrant the hassle. So here is a rename PR, but I think my vote would be to just pass on it at this point.",
