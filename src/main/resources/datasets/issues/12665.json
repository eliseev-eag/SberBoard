  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nThere is a component which renders a child `<embed>`. The `src` property is retrieved from an endpoint and depends on the props passed to the component. When the property changes on an existing `<embed>`, the contents of that embed does not change. To fix, the component has to entirely replace the `<embed>` with something else (for instance, a loading state), and then put a new `<embed>` with the updated `src`.\r\n\r\nI've reproduced this on jsfiddle, below. Two trivia jsfiddles are referred to by the embed, but transitioning by clicking a button does not update the embed despite the property being visibly updated in the DevTools.\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/n5u2wwjg/33890/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen the `src` of the `<embed>` changes, the content should change with it.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReproduced on 16.2.0, unclear which version jsfiddle is using.\r\n\r\nVersion 65.0.3325.181, macOS 10.13.4 Beta (17E190a)",
