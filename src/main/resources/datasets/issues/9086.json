  "body": "In the doc of [ref attribute](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#adding-a-ref-to-a-dom-element):\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <input\r\n        type=\"text\"\r\n        ref={(input) => { this.textInput = input; }} />\r\n    </div>\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI thinks it maybe cause performance problem just as the arrow function of event bind in [handle event](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/handling-events.html)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrender() {\r\n  // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick\r\n  return (\r\n    <button onClick={(e) => this.handleClick(e)}>\r\n      Click me\r\n    </button>\r\n  ); \r\n}\r\n\r\nthe doc mention the performance problem at below:\r\n\r\nThe problem with this syntax is that a different callback is created each time the LoggingButton renders. \r\nIn most cases, this is fine. However, if this callback is passed as a prop to lower components, those \r\ncomponents **might do an extra re-rendering**. We generally recommend binding in the constructor or \r\nusing the property initializer syntax, to avoid this sort of performance problem.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in the [ref attribute](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#adding-a-ref-to-a-dom-element) section,there are no tips.\r\n\r\nSo I want to know your thoughts on this.Thanks.",
