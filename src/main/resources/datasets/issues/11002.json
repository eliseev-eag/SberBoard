  "body": "Hello! I am enjoying going over the new React documentation as I am tutoring a beginner. While reading over the State and Lifecycle documentation, I came across an example where it's possible some confusion may occur. Because of the proximity to the explanation of lifecycle events, a beginner may see `tick()` before they come across the list of lifecycle events and may be lead to believe that all components run a timer every second.\r\n\r\nThis documentation change clarifies how the method `tick()` relates to the example given in the State and Lifecycle documentation. Why this change is necessary is because it may be confusing for beginners who may mistake `tick()` to be a lifecycle API hook.  To clarify, the verbiage is changed so that it becomes more clear that the method is specific to the component and not the API.",
