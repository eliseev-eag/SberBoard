  "body": "The plan is to move unnecessary state out of the production renderer. Therefore there will be no public API to introspect the current state of the tree. I.e. no `_renderedChildren`, props inspection etc.\n\nThe React DevTools will maintain its own shadow tree for introspection / reflection purposes.\n\nHowever, this also means that if you use `React.render` to run deeply rendered unit tests, you will no longer be able to use various reflective APIs to inspect the state of the current React tree. Such as `ReactTestUtils.findAllInRenderedTree`, the legacy `reactComponentExpect` utils etc.\n\nOur recommended unit testing solution is shallow testing.\n\nHowever, it would be possible to create a new renderer that keeps track of the whole React tree, including props, and therefore reenables stateful unit testing. That might be a helpful upgrade path. E.g. something like `ReactTestUtils.render` which would have a forked version of the primary renderer.\n\nSee #4151\n\ncc @spicyj , @dataminr\n",
