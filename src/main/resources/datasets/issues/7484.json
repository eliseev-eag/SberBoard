  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\n(Possibly a) Bug\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\nWhen using react addons perf and printWasted I do not see as many entries as I think I should. In the example case I see no entries.\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\nhttps://github.com/foiseworth/react-perf-tools-issue/blob/master/src/App.js\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nRoot > App should show in printWasted as it does re-render when you click but the output is just a cached element so it was a wasted render.\n\nAs you can see this code will walk up the tree from the Bottom component (which wasn't a wasted render) and mark the App as not a wasted render even though it was.\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/shared/ReactPerf.js#L206\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n15.3.0 / Mac OSX / Unsure\n",
