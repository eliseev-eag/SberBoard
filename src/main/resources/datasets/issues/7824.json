  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\n\nBug\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\n\nReact fails to update text nodes in IE8\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\n\nThis is as close as I could get to a reproduction: https://fiddle.jshell.net/zrozubsb/1/show/\n\nI think JSFiddle itself doesn't work in IE8 though, so it's masking the real problem, which you can see here:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1112998/18934304/cdfe5038-858d-11e6-80cd-2e234c1d007d.png)\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n\nDOM updates/doesn't throw error\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\nReact 15.3.1. Internet Explorer 8. Not sure if it ever worked; I have a feeling it didn't.\n\n---\n\nI will be submitting a PR for this shortly as I know you aren't actively supporting IE8 any more, but it's actually a pretty simple fix. I hope I outlined the issue well enough.\n",
