  "body": "The new context API stores the provided values on the shared context instance. When used in a synchronous context, this is not an issue. However when used in an concurrent context this can cause a \"push provider\" from one react render to have an effect on an unrelated concurrent react render.\r\n\r\nI've encountered this bug in production when using renderToNodeStream, which asks ReactPartialRenderer for bytes up to a high water mark before yielding. If two Node Streams are created and read from in parallel, the state of one can polute the other.\r\n\r\nI wrote a failing test to illustrate the conditions under which this happens.\r\n\r\nI'm also concerned that the experimental concurrent/async React rendering on the client could suffer from the same issue.\r\n",
