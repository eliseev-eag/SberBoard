  "body": "Hello there. Are there any plans for including official community-supported translations for React docs? At @translaiton-gang we've just completed Vue.js` docs Russian translation, and we also have some progress with React ones. I believe, at least Japanese and Chinese communities would also like to have their own translations. So, could we integrate it somehow?\r\n\r\nUPD: I see some random translation files under `docs/community`. Is it how it's done now? How is the document version to display being detected? I mean, I can't see any header dropdown language choice or something.",
