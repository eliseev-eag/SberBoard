  "body": "The map is not complete yet, however I'm wondering what the best approach would be here. I could re-use the `ReactInstanceMap` implementation (love the simplicity btw.), but that would require everything to always be an object for the map. Or I could use an existing polyfill to implement this, but I haven't found any perf testing yet on those polyfills. \n",
