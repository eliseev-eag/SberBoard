  "body": "This PR refactors the experimental event API to use event objects at the point of the responder module, rather than via indirection through the responder context `dispatchEvent`. This allows responder events to be strongly typed and it also means we can avoid using the plugin event system to dispatch the event and instead handle the event directly within the responder system itself.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this removes `stopPropagation` and `preventDefault` from event objects. The short term expectation is that their functionality will exist again but, instead of imperative method calls, the behaviour will live inside the React component tree. This will happen in follow up PRs.",
