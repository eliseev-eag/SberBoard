  "body": "Since fiber types can change during work (see MemoComponent -> SimpleMemoComponent) it seems more appropriate to use the elementType instead to determine a component name.\r\n\r\nMakes #15313 easier (see https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15313#discussion_r275157235). It would also enable #14319 since we no longer rely on internal data structures (fiber types) but public element types.",
