  "body": "Today at work we were trying to debug some code that used stateless components. We found out, that it's not possible to use `refs` on the stateless components as described in the docs. We founded this issue: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4936\r\nand given that it wasn't obvious behaviour, we decided to add this info to the Caveats section in the doc page about ref.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think about this. Thanks!\r\n",
