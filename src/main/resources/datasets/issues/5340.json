  "body": "Hi everybody, \n\nI'm just started learning React recently, and often found myself lost in the limbo when reading about Flux. \nI know it's just the concept about the application architecture to develop website with React.\nBut I have an idea that use routing with Express and use React for rendering the view only.\nIs it a good solution? And should I abandon Flux? \nIs there any reason why we should use Flux?\n\nThanks,\nHuy\n",
