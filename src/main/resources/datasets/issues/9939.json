  "body": "**what is the change?:**\r\nWe ran the latest version of\r\n`addons/create-react-class/create-react-class.js` through https://jscompress.com/\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nThe last corner case I'm thinking of is this:\r\n - The `createClass` deprecation warning never went out in 15.5, and is going out now for real in 15.6.\r\n - The `createClass` UMD build is broken for AMD/CommonJS, but we fixed it. But not for the minified version of the file.\r\n - If someone see the warning, and tries to use the UMD build, then it's going to be broken in some cases.\r\n - Since we're skipping mentioning the add-ons in the blog post, and this might be a new warning for them, this could be a nasty surprise for folks.\r\n\r\nWe can do a quick 15.5.4 release of that package, we would at least fix that case. Seemed worth doing since it took 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nThis diverges from what @gaearon is doing to fix the add-ons. I would\r\nprobably try to use cherry-pick and interactive rebase to move this\r\ncommit to right after\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/commit/ce3ecfb1dfaacb311fb4b37eede56c2667014cfc\r\nand then do the patch release of `create-react-class` from that spot in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nAlternately I can merge this into the forked branch\r\n`15.6-before-addon-reconstruction` and then do the patch release from\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nI didn't test this. Ideally minifying this file won't break anything,\r\nand it's high cost to test add-ons until we have some repeatable tests\r\nin place.\r\n\r\n**issue:**\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9765\r\n\r\n**Before submitting a pull request,** please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.\r\n2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.\r\n4. Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test`).\r\n5. Make sure your code lints (`npm run lint`).\r\n6. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`npm run prettier`).\r\n7. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) typechecks (`npm run flow`).\r\n8. If you added or removed any tests, run `./scripts/fiber/record-tests` before submitting the pull request, and commit the resulting changes.\r\n9. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n",
