The browser's syntax error reporting is pretty much useless, at least in Firefox (it just says \"syntax error\" pointing at the script tag that includes react, or something equally unhelpful).\n\n(I'm surprised that I didn't find an existing issue on this, because I can't be the first person to lose a bunch of time on this, but I didn't.)\n",
