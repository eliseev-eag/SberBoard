  "body": "After digging deeper with [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52553580/react-children-with-non-element-children), I have found `function as a child` is not being considered as **children**.\r\n\r\nTake this example:\r\n```\r\nclass CountExpression extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    const children = React.Children.toArray(this.props.children)\r\n    console.log(children)\r\n    return <p>{React.Children.count(children)}</p>\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n<CountExpression>\r\n   {'one'}\r\n   {'two'}\r\n   { () => <p>Still, this will be ignored as child. Why?</p>}\r\n   <p>This will be included in array - that's fine</p>\r\n</CountExpression>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I would like know why is it so? Is it a bug or an expected behavior?",
