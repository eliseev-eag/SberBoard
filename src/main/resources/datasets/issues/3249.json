  "body": "From Twitter: https://twitter.com/Vjeux/status/569985084524081153\n\nWhen using PhantomJS for testing browser interaction, often times what seems to happen is that values get changed directly on the DOM elements and then the 'change' event is triggered on the element. Because of this, interacting with ReactJS elements through PhantomJS and through jQuery doesn't work for some interactive elements like `<input>` and `<select>`.\n\nOf course, the easiest solution is to take the real elements that are mounted and attach event listeners to them like `$(this.MyRef.getDOMNode()).on(EVENT, CALLBACK)`, but it isn't the most pleasant experience.\n\nIs there any interest in mirroring events on the real nodes to the synthetic events, or is this situation normal? I'd like to be able to interact with my application through PhantomJS, but this seems to be quite the blocker when interacting with input and select elements.\n\nJSBin example here: http://jsbin.com/xawogo/3/edit\n",
