  "body": "This is a pretty invasive refactor of the SuspenseComponent and DehydratedSuspenseComponent.\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this refactor is to avoid the hacky \"upgrade\" and \"downgrade\" by mutating the tag.\r\n\r\nIn the new model, a boundary is always represented by the same SuspenseComponent fiber. Inside it I store a \"DehydratedFragment\". The inner fiber represents the dehydrated nodes in the tree. This can be used to delete the whole thing or insert before it.\r\n\r\nI also switched legacy mode to always client-render the boundary content since we can't hydrate partially in legacy mode. It also warns.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, this (hopefully) shouldn't have an semantic differences.",
