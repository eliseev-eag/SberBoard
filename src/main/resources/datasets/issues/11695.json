  "body": "ESLint by default searches for configurations files up to the root directory. To quote ESLint [documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#configuration-cascading-and-hierarchy)\r\n\r\n> By default, ESLint will look for configuration files in all parent folders up to the root directory. This can be useful if you want all of your projects to follow a certain convention, but can sometimes lead to unexpected results.\r\n\r\nThis is not necessarily wrong, but it can definitely lead to unexpected situations such as having an invalid package.json file in any parent directory and getting an error message or even trickier ones, where a package.json file in any parent directories takes precedence and you end up with different lint rules than those those specified in the project.\r\n\r\nBy adding the `'root': true` option in the configuration we limit it to the specific project.",
