  "body": "\r\nHi guys, I'm wondering if it's possible to only return dom elements from ref callbacks. \r\nIn a codebase we are working on currently, we have the need to use to refs in some parts. We find that we have to wrap our components id divs just so we can get a dom element in the ref; this is required by another library we are using (openlayers). \r\n\r\nIt would be more convenient if only dom elements were returned in the callback (unless ofcourse there is a reason for having custom component object proxies in the callback; in which case can't we have the dom element attached to the proxy?).\r\n\r\nIf it's a trivial change, I would be willing (given some guidance of course ðŸ™‚) to work on it.",
