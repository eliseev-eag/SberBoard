  "body": "To my current understanding, `useLayoutEffect` is used to interact with the browser layout, and to allow you to update a component accordingly.\r\n\r\nIf a sub-component updates, it is possible that the layout of the parent component changes.\r\n\r\nIn the current version of React, the `useLayoutEffect` would not be called on the parent, so the parent is unable to react to layout changes. This makes this API unsuitable for a lot of layout-based use-cases, despite this being its primary use-case.\r\n\r\nIs this something that should be revisited?",
