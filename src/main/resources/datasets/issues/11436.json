  "body": "I'm confused about this error:\r\n`Failed form propType: You provided a `value` prop to a form field without an `onChange` handler.`\r\n\r\nIt makes sense that it would complain about inputs of other types but it seems like a bug to show up for a submit button. W3's docs states that `value` is valid to show text for a submit input, and the docs for React clearly show examples with forms and submit buttons where the only piece of button code is\r\n`<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" />` (https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html).\r\n\r\nMy code is simple. I have a Button component and it's called like this:\r\n`<Button text=\"Something\" />`\r\n\r\nand my component renders like this:\r\n```\r\n<input \r\n    type=\"submit\" \r\n    className={ `button ${ this.props.extraClass }` } \r\n    value={ this.props.text } \r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I get the warning and my button doesn't submit the form (it's apart of a form object with an `onSubmit handler`) I believe it's rendering as readOnly as the warning states. Does anyone know why this happens?\r\n\r\n",
