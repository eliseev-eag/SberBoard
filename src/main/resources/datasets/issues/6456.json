  "body": "In `0.14` it was [quite easy](https://github.com/Wildhoney/Keo/blob/master/docs/SHADOW_DOM.md) to render a component into a shadow root &mdash; this was due to the [`nodeType` check in `ReactDOMComponent`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/0.14-stable/src/renderers/dom/shared/ReactDOMComponent.js#L302-L304).\n\nHowever you'll notice that in `15.0` that [check has been completely removed](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/15-stable/src/renderers/dom/shared/ReactDOMComponent.js#L216) and as such will **always** bind events to the `#document` element &mdash; the `ownerDocument`, rather than the `#document-fragment`.\n\nAs the events that cross the shadow boundary are retargeted to appear as though they're from the shadow host instead of the internals, React's event delegating fails to invoke the event function. In the case of `0.14` the event delegation on the `#document-fragment` correctly handled the event, as it was able to [inspect the `listenerBank`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/15-stable/src/renderers/shared/event/EventPluginHub.js#L128-L131) before retargeting was performed &mdash; any further propagation of the event would have been unnecessary.\n\nNow I realise React doesn't support Shadow DOM natively &mdash; however it seems as though we've taken a little step back, especially with Angular 2 and its Shadow DOM support on the horizon. I'm merely wondering as to the rationale behind the removal of the `ownerDocument` check, and whether we'd be happy to add it back in?\n\n<sup>(For those people who dislike the [CSS Module](http://glenmaddern.com/articles/css-modules) approach)</sup>\n",
