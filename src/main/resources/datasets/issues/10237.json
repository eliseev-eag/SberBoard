  "body": "WIP. I think this is mostly done, still looking at pooling in `TopLevelCallbackBookKeeping`\r\n\r\nThis PR removes `PooledClass` from the synthetic event system in favor of a simpler, event-specific pooling system. \r\n\r\n* It maintains the same pooling API (`getPooled`, `release`) to minimize churn in the event system.\r\n* Instead of `PooledClass.addPoolingTo` it now uses a helper `addEventPoolingTo` defined in the `SyntheticEvent` module\r\n* Removes pooling all-together from `FallbackCompositionState`. It was only being used in a single event plugin, and the way it's structured makes it so there's only ever a single instance anyway. This means we don't need any sort of pooling. Instead, the composition state is now tracked in a single object which can be initialized and reset.",
