  "body": "#### Ensure all commits in master were tested at Facebook.\r\n\r\n* Check that they were a part of the latest internal sync.\r\n* For stable releases, prefer that they’ve been landed for a week or so.\r\n* Only skip this step if you really know what you’re doing!\r\n\r\n#### Verify that you have npm permissions.\r\n\r\n- [x] You’re in `npm owner ls react`\r\n- [x] You’re in `npm owner ls react-art`\r\n- [x] You’re in `npm owner ls react-dom`\r\n- [x] You’re in `npm owner ls react-test-renderer`\r\n- If not, ping someone on the team!\r\n\r\n#### Ensure your React is fresh.\r\n\r\n- [x] Ensure you’re on `master`\r\n- [x] Do a `git pull`\r\n- [x] Is master green on CI? Check [the most recent commits](https://github.com/facebook/react/commits/master).\r\n- [x] Check that your local `git log` output matches the commit list.\r\n- [x] Run `yarn` in the repo root.\r\n\r\n#### Ensure runtime dependencies match what users would get.\r\n\r\n- [x] For `fbjs`:\r\n  - [x] Look at the version range of `fbjs` in root `package.json`.\r\n  - [x] Ensure all `packages/*/package.json` depending on `fbjs` specify the same range.\r\n- [x] For `object-assign`:\r\n  - [x] Look at the version range of `object-assign` in root `package.json`.\r\n  - [x] Ensure all `packages/*/package.json` depending on `object-assign` specify the same range.\r\n- [x] For `prop-types`:\r\n  - [x] Look at the version range of `prop-types` in root `package.json`.\r\n  - [x] Ensure all `packages/*/package.json` depending on `prop-types` specify the same range.\r\n- [x] Run `yarn upgrade object-assign prop-types fbjs`\r\n- [x] This might change the lockfile. This **should not** change any `package.json`.\r\n- [x] Commit the changes, if any.\r\n\r\n#### Do the local sanity checks in the repo root.\r\n\r\n- [x] Run `yarn test` in the repo root.\r\n- [x] Run `yarn lint` in the repo root.\r\n- [x] Run `yarn flow` in the repo root.\r\n\r\n#### _STABLE RELEASE ONLY:_ Update error codes.\r\n\r\n- [x] Run `yarn build -- --extract-errors` in the repo root.\r\n- [x] If `scripts/error-codes/codes.json` changes, `git commit -am 'Update error codes'`\r\n- [ ] **Maybe:** If we still have a separate `*-stable` branch for docs when you’re reading this, we need to cherry-pick that commit to that branch. This makes sure the website decoder knows about the updated error codes. But ideally we should just change docs to serve from master.\r\n\r\n#### _STABLE RELEASE ONLY:_ Write the changelog.\r\n\r\n- [x] Open `CHANGELOG.md` and add release notes in the same format as earlier.\r\n- [x] Make sure the changes are easy to understand. Friendly one-liners are better than PR titles.\r\n- [x] Make sure all contributors are credited, just like before.\r\n- [x] Verify that the markup isn’t messed up by previewing it in the [online editor](https://github.com/facebook/react/edit/master/CHANGELOG.md).\r\n\r\n#### Update the version.\r\n\r\n- [x] Update `version` in root `package.json`\r\n- [x] Update export in `src/ReactVersion.js`\r\n- [x] Update `version` in all `packages/*/package.json`:\r\n  - [x] `packages/react/package.json`\r\n  - [x] `packages/react-art/package.json`\r\n  - [x] `packages/react-dom/package.json`\r\n  - [x] `packages/react-noop-renderer/package.json`\r\n  - [x] `packages/react-test-renderer/package.json`\r\n  - [x] If you see any other packages, update this list :-)\r\n- [x] Run `yarn version-check` to verify your changes.\r\n- [x] `git commit -am \"<version number>\"`\r\n\r\n#### Build it!\r\n\r\n- [x] Run `yarn build` in the repo root.\r\n\r\n#### Run fast packaging smoke test.\r\n\r\n- [x] Open `fixtures/packaging/babel-standalone/dev.html` in the browser for a smoke test.\r\n- [x] It should say “Hello world!”\r\n\r\n#### Run slow packaging smoke test.\r\n\r\n- [x] Go to `cd fixtures/packaging` and run `node build-all.js`\r\n- [x] `npm install -g serve`\r\n- [x] Go to the repo root and run `serve -s .`\r\n- [x] Open http://localhost:5000/fixtures/packaging/ and verify every iframe shows “Hello World!”\r\n\r\n#### Release!\r\n\r\n- [x] Run `git push`\r\n- [x] Run `git push --tags`\r\n- [x] Go to `build/packages`\r\n  - [x] For every subfolder:\r\n    - [ ] **For non-stable versions:** Run `npm publish --tag next` in the subfolder.\r\n    - [x] **For stable versions:** Run `npm publish` in the subfolder.\r\n- [x] Run `npm info <package> dist-tags` to verify that things were published as you expect.\r\n- [ ] **FIXME:** We should really automate this part because it’s currently not atomic.\r\n\r\n#### _STABLE RELEASE ONLY:_ Create GitHub Release.\r\n\r\n- [x] Open [New Release](https://github.com/facebook/react/releases/new) page on GitHub.\r\n- [x] Choose the tag version you just pushed in the dropdown so that it says “Existing tag”.\r\n- [x] Paste the new release notes from `CHANGELOG.md`.\r\n- [x] Attach all files in `build/dist/*.js` except `react-art.*` to the release.\r\n- [x] Press “Publish release”!\r\n\r\n#### _STABLE RELEASE ONLY:_ Update the version reported on the website.\r\n\r\n- [x] Open `docs/_config.yml`\r\n- [x] Change `react_version` in it to the newly published version.\r\n- [x] `git commit -am \"Update the reported React version on the website\"`\r\n- [ ] **Maybe:** If we still have a separate `*-stable` branch for docs when you’re reading this, we need to cherry-pick that commit to that branch. This makes sure the website knows about the updated config. But ideally we should just change docs to serve from master.\r\n\r\n#### _STABLE RELEASE ONLY:_ Update Bower.\r\n\r\n- [x] Clone the Bower repo outside of main repo: `git clone https://github.com/reactjs/react-bower.git`\r\n- [x] Make sure it’s on `master` and you did `git pull`\r\n- [x] Delete all JS files from the Bower repo and copy all `build/dist/*.js` from React repo into it.\r\n- [x] In the Bower repo, `git commit -am \"<version number>\"`\r\n- [x] In the Bower repo, `git tag -a v<version number>` (Don’t miss the `v`!)\r\n- [x] In the Bower repo, `git push` and `git push --tags`\r\n\r\n#### _STABLE RELEASE ONLY:_ Try it out!\r\n\r\n- [x] `npm i -g create-react-app`\r\n- [x] `create-react-app myapp`\r\n- [x] `cd myapp`\r\n- [x] `npm start`\r\n\r\n#### _STABLE RELEASE ONLY_: Reach out to DOM team.\r\n\r\n- [x] Reach out to the DOM team (@nhunzaker @jquense @aweary) in case they would like to go through DOM fixtures.
