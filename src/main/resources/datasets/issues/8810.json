  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\n*bug* ?\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nCurrently after component state change the input element loose focus (I think due to misleading reconciliation mechanism). Playing with `key` doesn't get it work as expected. If we'd remove `this.props.children` from `App` component everything will work as expected. \r\nAnother way to fix this issue is to change `FormInput` component in slightly other way: https://jsfiddle.net/ishestakov/vyypqt60/1/\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/ishestakov/jdcL1bjn/\r\nIf you'd start typing in the input the focus would be lost due to DOM manipulations\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe expected behavior is to only update HTML elements during reconciliation and thus not to loose the focus\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nLatest, also this is reproducible on 0.14.7.",
