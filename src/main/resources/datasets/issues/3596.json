  "body": "I've just been bit by\n\n> React's JSX uses the upper vs. lower case convention to distinguish between local component classes and HTML tags.\n\nand as an after-thought I remembered something about lower-case/upper-case jsx tags. As a good React citizen, I've searched for it on the React site and found it documented here: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html\n\nI'm not new to React, but this took me around 10 minutes to trace down. I generally follow the convention, but I just developed a simple `centered` component for a mostly static site, that simply clones it's children and adds \n`margin: 0 auto; max-width: 900` to each of them. So I thought of this as a simple utility and therefore I lower-cased it.\n\nI understand this might not change, but it's worth at least adding a warning on uncommon html tag names, or better yet, on lowercase jsx tags that are also local variables.\n",
