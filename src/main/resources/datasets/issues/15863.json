Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/react-hdf3sg\r\nChange the \"Layout Size Ratio\"\r\nYou'll see the box resize with the ratio.\r\nNow resize, it resets it to the initial state\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThat the state doesn't revert. (unless I'm misusing react)\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nGoogle chrome. idk about previous versions.\r\n\r\nI've also posted on stack overflow\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/56511176/state-being-reset\r\n\r\nI'm not fully sure if this is a bug or my misuse of react.\r\n",
