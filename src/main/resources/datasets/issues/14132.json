But when I dynamically add an outer component (C), the initialized state inside the parent component (I initialize some state in the constructor) is the props of the B component, not the props of C I want, and When I add C at the end, it is the correct props, so I think the props of the newly added component C depend on the props of the last rendered component.\r\nMy English is not good, I don't know if you can understand it.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.
