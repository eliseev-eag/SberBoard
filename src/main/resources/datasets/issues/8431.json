  "body": "Currently React exposes `React.createElement(type, config, children)` [1] to the outside world and internally calls the `ReactElement(type, key, ref, self, source, owner, props)` [2] function to create the actual Element instance.\r\n\r\n`React.createElement` performs a copy of `config` to create `props` and extract `key` and `ref`. \r\n\r\nIn the ClojureScript world many libraries wrap React to provide a more cljs-idiomatic interface using CLJS persistent maps for props. The \"hiccup\"-syntax is very popular and convenient.\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n[:div {:key \"my-key\" :ref my-ref-fn :other \"props\"}\r\n  [:h1 \"text]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this is far from ideal since we first allocate the CLJS data structures in addition to just `ReactElement`s it is particular inconvenient that we convert the props data once and React does again. It would safe a lot of overhead if you could just call `ReactElement` directly saving a whole lot of work.\r\n\r\n`React.createElementRaw(type, key, ref, props)` would be nice (as the others would be `null` anyways) or maybe under a more obscure name (to discourage use). It is fine if this is marked experimental and not otherwise officially supported. \r\n\r\nHappy to create a matching PR if you folks agree to expose this somewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/6810627a91f2020caee7fecf21580187dc6ef0fc/src/isomorphic/classic/element/ReactElement.js#L183-L265\r\n[2] https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/6810627a91f2020caee7fecf21580187dc6ef0fc/src/isomorphic/classic/element/ReactElement.js#L117",
