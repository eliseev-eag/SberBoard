  "body": "I am not sure how bower support is achieved but it would be really nice to have some simple support for `component` thus allowing:\n\n```\ncomponent install facebook/react\n```\n\nThis would require a `component.json` in the git repo with a `\"scripts\": ...` field pointing to the source files or more likely just a built non-minified dist file given you aren't using `component build` to build this project.\n\nTher's also the issue of add-ons but one thing at a time.\n",
