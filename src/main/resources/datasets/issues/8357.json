However an unexpected thing occurs in mobile (tested in latest iOS on latest mobile chrome and safari).\r\n\r\nWhen you select a value, the select is replaced by a standard button that does nothing. But once you tap on the button, the browser brings up the select menu again even though there is no select element there. If you look into the DOM, there is no select element.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nWhen the select is removed via onChange and the button shows up, tapping the button should do nothing.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n15.3.0.\r\nBrowsers: latest mobile chrome & safari\r\nOS: latest iOS\r\n",
