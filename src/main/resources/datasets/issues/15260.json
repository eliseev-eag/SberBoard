  "body": "Resolves issue #15255 cc @bgirard \r\n\r\nReact uses the [User Timing API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/User_Timing_API) to mark and measure time spent working on various things for development builds. This can be a useful source of information when it comes to cross-referencing browser performance traces. We avoid doing this in production mode though, due to the performance overhead of using the API.\r\n\r\nI believe that we could make an exception for our [profiling bundles](https://fb.me/react-profiling) and log measurements for `Profiler` nodes only. This should be a lot less heavyweight than the full development measurements, while still providing a potentially useful signal in the trace logs.\r\n\r\nHere's an initial pass at this. This change has a minimal impact on the development bundle behavior- (including the `Profiler` id as part of the display name)- which seemed safe enough. I also verified that none of the timer related code leaks into the production bundle.\r\n\r\n### Development bundle\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-03-29 at 1 25 51 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/55260818-9d220c80-5226-11e9-94fd-fa739eddf838.png)\r\n\r\n### Profiling bundle\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-03-29 at 1 30 42 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/55260924-deb2b780-5226-11e9-82fd-94780a139e91.png)\r\n",
