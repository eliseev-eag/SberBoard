  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nI guess bug, but this is not stable feature, so not sure\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nHere is the classical issue with async components in React.\r\n\r\nWhen React application boots (`ReactDOM.render`) and some components are not loaded, it will flush current available components, which can be some loader or empty screen (`null`). If there was some HTML before (SSR or prerendered with react-snap) user will see flash of white screen.\r\n\r\n![filmstrip 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/179534/49975003-1fb6e280-ff3c-11e8-881b-d34eda33bd07.png)\r\n\r\nI expected that `Suspense` would solve this issue, because it suppose to pause rendering. So I hopped it will not flush placeholder while it waits for subcomponent to load.\r\n\r\nOn the other side - I know that Suspense and asynchronous rendering is not finished yet, so I hope it will be fixed in the future.\r\n\r\n**Demo**: https://github.com/stereobooster/react-async-issue\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:stereobooster/react-async-issue.git\r\ncd react-async-issue\r\nyarn\r\n# remove homepage from package.json otherwise it will not work locally\r\nyarn build\r\nnpx serve -s build\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr you can check online version https://stereobooster.github.io/react-async-issue/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI expect that `Suspense` will pause rendering of React until `maxDuration` times out or all components get loaded (whatever comes first), and before this no DOM changes would be flushed.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.6.3. Feature is fresh so no sense to check in previous versions.\r\n\r\n",
