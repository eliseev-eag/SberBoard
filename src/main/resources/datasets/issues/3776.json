  "body": "> Lots of people use React as the V in MVC\n\nI'm sure there was some thought put into this phrase on the website, but I think it breeds the idea that you just dump `React.render` inside of a `Backbone.View.render` as though its a recommended application architecture. In my experience, people end up with all the same problems they had before react: incomprehensible webs of events, cascading updates, etc.\n\nPerhaps something like:\n\n> React is only concerned about rendering UI. Since it makes no assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, it's easy to try it out on a small feature in an existing project, or at the top of a new one.\n",
