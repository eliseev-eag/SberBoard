  "body": "We encountered this while trying to have different parts of form validation happen on both the onBlur and the onClick. It seems that if you update State on an onBlur, and that state element is injected into the DOM via JSX, positionally ABOVE a button with an onClick--the onClick will not fire. \n\nI believe this is related to this issue: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/2291\n\nSee this http://jsfiddle.net/kb3gN/11477/ which is a variation on the example provided above. If you enter some text, you'll have to click the button twice, to see click: true.\n\nNot 100% confident that order matters in the DOM, but you can see it consistently reproducable in the JSFiddle above. \n\n @andela-domonori first noticed the weird behavior. \n",
