  "body": "Fixes #12251\r\n\r\nWe can get rid of some special cases by relying on bubbling for `submit` and `reset` events instead of adding the events to the individual `<form>` elements. After reading #12251 I was curious and had to try that out. Here are my manual testing results:\r\n\r\n#### Modern\r\n✅ Chrome 67 \r\n✅ Firefox 61\r\n ✅ Edge 17\r\n✅ Safari 12\r\n\r\n#### Legacy\r\n✅ Chromium 41\r\n✅ Firefox ESR 52\r\n✅ Safari 6\r\n✅ Internet Explorer 9\r\n\r\n(The browser list is inspired by https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9301#issuecomment-334274439)\r\n\r\n***Note:** This does not fix any bug and also only has minimal impact on the bundle size. I'm not sure if we really want it.*\r\n\r\nI used a custom [fixture](https://github.com/philipp-spiess/react/commit/c7d8ad34bc21368ea9aed6871abc85c174205043) to test that if you want to reproduce. I don't think we want to add this though since I hardly believe that this behavior will ever change again and it would only make manual testing even more time consuming. Let me know if you think I should add it.\r\n\r\nWhile looking in the repository for occurrences of the term `submit`, I also found a lonely test that that was written more than 5 years ago and probably never run until now. The behavior still works, although the API changed quite a bit over the years. Seems like this test was part of the initial public release already: https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/75897c2dcd1dd3a6ca46284dd37e13d22b4b16b4#diff-1bf5126edab96f3b7fea034cd3b0c742R31\r\n\r\nIn addition to all that, I also found out that the yarn lockfile for the DOM fixtures was outdated.",
