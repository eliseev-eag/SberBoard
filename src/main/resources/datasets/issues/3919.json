  "body": "Our tests currently only pass in the browser when running in Chrome. This is because it supports WebComponents already. However they fail in every other browser. I think this is because of when webcomponents.js is actually loaded. It's currently getting packaged into react-test because we're requiring it. It creates a new `Node` which is resulting in nodes we create with `createNodeFromMarkup` to have a different prototype than what is expected in WebComponents. WebComponents's new Node prototype has a different implementation of `insertBefore` which does an `instanceof Node` check which our nodes are failing. I think if we loaded webcomponents.js into the browser before we loaded JS, the node we create for markup wrapping would have the right prototype.\n",
