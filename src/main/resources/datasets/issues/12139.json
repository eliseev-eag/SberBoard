  "body": "I'm a bit new to react. If you have any advice or pointers on my current implementation, i'm always open for advice. \r\n\r\n**Question**\r\nSo i extended the react component class to create a new component.\r\n```\r\nexport default class Comp extends React.Component {\r\n\r\n    method() {\r\n         // do something\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo render the component i'm using the following code:\r\n```\r\nconst nodes = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.class'));\r\nnodes.forEach((node) => {\r\n    ReactDOM.render(<Comp/>, node)\r\n});\r\n```\r\nI'm doing it like this because an element could be on different places on the page. We are currently in a transition of moving all te components to react. But we are not there yet.\r\n\r\nSo if i have multiple components on the page. How can i call the method of a specific component instance? Is there a way to get the instance by selecting the dom element? Or should i approach this in a totally different way? \r\n\r\n",
