The first one adds a test, the last one fixes the bug. The ones in the middle prepare the code to look readable after the bugfix.\r\n\r\nI verified both https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10906 and https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11152 reproduced before, but no longer reproduce after the bugfix.",
