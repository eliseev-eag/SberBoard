  "body": "When trying out the tutorial, I had just moved my comments data to a separate `.json` file, and created the `setInterval` function to poll for changes to the file. (Section titled \"[Updating state](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html#updating-state)\")\n\nAt the bottom of this section the tutorial states \"Try running this in your browser and changing the comments.json file; within 2 seconds, the changes will show!\" They didn't :disappointed:\n\nIt just kept returning the same content, until I told the `$.ajax` call not to cache the result by setting the `cache` option to `false`. Then the comments that I added came through OK and the state of the component updated automatically as expected.\n\nThis PR doesn't add any explanation about the `cache` option, and adds it to any call (also in the KR and JP tutorial.) Most people may be accustomed to using the following:\n\n``` js\n$.ajaxSetup({ cache: false });\n```\n\nWhich would make all calls to XHR functions not cache by default, but for the sake of this tutorial, and avoidance in setting global config options for jQuery, I think it's a good idea to include it in each call so that things work as expected for newbies like myself :smile: \n",
