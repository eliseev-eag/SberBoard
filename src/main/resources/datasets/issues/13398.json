The implementation is fairly simple and could be left to userspace, but since this is an important use case, there's value in standardization.\r\n\r\nFinal name is TBD. I went with `lazy` for now because it's short and descriptive.\r\n\r\nI put it on the main React export because it's small and importing this at the top of every file will get old really quickly.",
