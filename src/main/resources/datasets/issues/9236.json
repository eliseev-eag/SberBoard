Also please let me know if any of my assumptions are totally wrong!\r\n\r\n* It seems that React is mutating the updater right? Which is guess this are \"valid\" mutations. Considering that my assumption is correct, what does a \"valid updater\" is? I currently check for it being either `ReactServerUpdateQueue` or a `ReactNoopUpdateQueue` but I'm not sure if this is correct.\r\n* @acdlite https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9188#discussion_r106303781 I'm having some trouble getting the component name. I tried `getComponentName(instance)` but I'm sure I'm doing something wrong here\r\n* I'm getting an error when running `yarn build` which I guess it has to do with the bundle that gets created for browserify\r\n```\r\nRunning \"browserify:basic\" (browserify) task\r\n>> Error: Cannot find module './ReactServerUpdateQueue' from '/Users/rogelioguzman/dev/react/build/node_modules/react/lib'\r\n\r\nRunning \"browserify:min\" (browserify) task\r\n>> Error: Cannot find module './ReactServerUpdateQueue' from '/Users/rogelioguzman/dev/react/build/node_modules/react/lib'\r\n```",
