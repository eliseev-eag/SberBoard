  "body": "This forks `DOMPropertyOperations` into two different files: `DOMPropertyOperations` is DOM-only and `DOMMarkupOperations` is SSR-only. This way we don’t have to bundle DOM-only code paths into the SSR renderer. I guess ES6 modules would also help here but I didn’t want to wait. I also rewrote markup-related unit tests as integration tests.\r\n\r\nIn last few commits I also rewrote tests for CSS properties in public API, and split markup generation (server only), warning about key-value pairs (shared), and setting properties and validation (client-only).",
