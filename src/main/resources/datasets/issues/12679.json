This is the expected behaviour for this browser.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this issue is that I only have access to the error logs from production via a beacon. I haven't been able to view any console logs  from running in the browser directly, and haven't been able to replicate it in any web editors since those sites just completely don't work in Opera Mini.\r\n\r\nI believe the error is referencing code here: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/1673485720d9ac172fcf1f8628a004a4990bf4f4/packages/react-scheduler/src/ReactScheduler.js#L52\r\n\r\nSorry if this is posted in the wrong place, I'm not 100% sure where I should report this since it's relating to a proxy browser that doesn't run JS on the client. \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen loading `babel-polyfill` before `react` and `react-dom`, the site will render as if it would in any other browser with JS switched off.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI'm seeing this behaviour only in Opera Mini on Android and iOS when in [extreme turbo](https://www.opera.com/turbo) mode.\r\n",
