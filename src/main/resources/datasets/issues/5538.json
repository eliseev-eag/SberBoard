You might be adding a ref to a component that was not created inside a component's 'render' method, or you have multiple copies of React loaded (details: https://fb.me/react-refs-must-have-owner).`\n\nThis has been talked about; the answer: 'don't run two copies of React!'. I got it. Here's the thing: I'm not running two copies of React. I'm building a React component npm module that is installed in a larger project. Within my module, I'm including React as a peer dependency and it's marked as an external in my webpack.config.js. This has actually been working fine all the time, with one exception: when my components have refs.\n\nI've gone so far as to use a document.querySelector() (yikes!) to get rid of that error message. There has to be a better way. I'm opening an issue now, though, because I want to use the react-widgets package and it uses refs. This is breaking my project.\n\nCan't React be smart enough to associate these refs with the running copy of React? Am I missing something?\n\nThanks\n\n-Ben\n",
