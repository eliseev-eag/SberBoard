This happens only while in production enviroment. \r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jdrzejb/react-rerender-bug \r\n\r\nApplication running in development mode is setting key prop properly, thus not making rerenders between route calls inside component.\r\nApp in production mode is appending new value to existing key resulting in rerender and this:\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/BHp8w \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nApplication in production mode should be setting proper key value and not rerendering.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI don't believe that this is browser problem. I had the same issue with Safari 11.0 and Chrome 62.\r\nI have tested it with React 15.6.2 and React 16.0.0\r\n\r\n\r\nI have tried to isolate this issue as much I could. If I can help you any further please let me know. ",
