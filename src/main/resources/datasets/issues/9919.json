  "body": "We absolutely need a build process and tests before making any further changes to these addons.\r\n\r\nThat said, this is a quick fix to hopefully improve the situation in conjunction with the 15.6 release. We will probably continue working on fixing the add-on packages after 15.6.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## The fix:\r\n**what is the change?:**\r\nManually tweaking the UMD builds for both add-ons to include a\r\ndependency on React.\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nThey were broken before for AMD and CommonJS.\r\nFor reasons I have not debugged, the CommonJS builds are still broken,\r\nbut the AMD is now fixed and globals still work:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    do 'react-linked-input' and\r\n    'create-react-fragment' work?\r\n\r\n                before      after\r\n              + my        + my        +\r\n  en^ironment | fix       | fix       |\r\n+----------------------------------------\r\n              |           |           |\r\n  Global JS   |  :) yes   |  :) yes   |\r\n+----------------------------------------\r\n              |           |           |\r\n  AMD         |  X no     |  :) yes   |\r\n+----------------------------------------\r\n              |           |           |\r\n  CommonJS    |  X no     |  X no     |\r\n+-------------+-----------+-----------+--\r\n\r\n```\r\n---\r\n## The process for testing the fix:\r\n**what is the change?:**\r\nSetting up the fixtures to enable manual testing of the\r\n`react-linked-input` and `create-fragment` UMD builds.\r\n\r\nThis was a painstaking and frustrating process and we need something\r\nbetter before making any more fixes to addons. Here is roughly what I\r\ndid;\r\n- add 'console.log' statements to the add-on to confirm that you've loaded the right build case\r\n- copy the add-on into 'build/packages' so that the 'webpack-alias' can find it.\r\n- make copies of each of the following three fixtures for each add-on you want to test, renaming them to specify what you are testing:\r\n\t- globals.js\r\n\t- requirejs.js\r\n\t- webpack-alias/*\r\n- modify those fixtures to use the add-on you intend to text\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nWe need to verify the current state of the bug before fixing it, to\r\nconfirm that the change actually is fixing the bug.\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\n`open fixtures/globals-with-create-react-fragment.html`\r\n`open fixtures/globals-with-react-linked-input.html`\r\n`open fixtures/requirejswith-create-react-fragment.html`\r\n`open fixtures/requirejswith-react-linked-input.html`\r\n`cd fixtures/webpack-aliaswith-create-react-fragment/ && yarn build && open index.html`\r\n`cd fixtures/webpack-aliaswith-react-linked-input/ && yarn build && open index.html`\r\n\r\n",
