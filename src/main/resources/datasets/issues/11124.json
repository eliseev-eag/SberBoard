  "body": "I noticed that the latest docs don't talk about [Transferring Props in JSX with rest properties](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/v15.4.0-rc.3/docs/docs/06-transferring-props.md#transferring-with--in-jsx). \r\n\r\nThis was really useful for building reusable react components. I was curious if omitting this documentation was intentional? If so, it would be great to understand why (not a good practice anymore?). \r\n\r\nOtherwise, I would be happy to send a PR that adds this back into the docs with any changes you and the community want to see. Overall, I just think this is important info to surface in the current docs. \r\n\r\n",
