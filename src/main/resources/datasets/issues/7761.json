  "body": "@spicyj \nI'm implementing a wizard framework, and the basic design is like below\n-  wizard container contains previous/next buttons,and several wizard pages\n-  wizard container maintains a ref to the current wizard page\n-  when the next button is clicked on wizard container , submit() of the current wizard page is invoked thru the ref\n\nhere is the sample code of a wizard page\n\n```\nexport default class BusinessInfoPage extends WizardPageBase {  \n   submit() {\n       let newState = Object.assign({},{\n           submit:true\n       })\n       this.setState(newState)\n   }\n    render() {\n        alert('current wizard page is re-rendered...')\n        let [title, subTitle, breadCrumb] = ['Tell us about your business', \n        'First we need some information about your company']\n        return (<WizardPage title={title} subTitle={subTitle}>\n                    <BusinessInfoForm onSubmit={this.onSubmit} \n                     prestine={this.state.submit}/>\n                </WizardPage>)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nthe problem is that, see I'm using Object.assign to set new state in the current wizard page, and I can see that every time I click the 'Next' button on the wizard container, the alert box pops up saying 'current wizard page is re-rendered'. However, the child component of the wizard page is not (I have an alert box on BusinessInfoForm's render function as well).\n\nI can understand that for the child component, which is BusinessInfoForm , since the passed in prop remains the same (prestine: [boolean] true), there is no need for it to re-render. So the behaviour kind of makes sense.\nHowever, when a parent Component gets re-rendered, shouldn't all its children component all get destroyed all re-constructed again?\nbut it seems like all the children components are **cached**, and are only re-rendered when needed...\n\nI know that I may call forceUpdate to force children components re-render, or simply pass in a new object instead of Boolean. I'm more interested in how react framework is designed than finding a solution for that.\n(yeah,, I know I can debug the source code,, but I don't want to go that far)\n\nCheers\n",
