  "body": "I've included a test link:\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/53n8kgu3/10/\n\n(an alert should happen when you change a select item)\n\nEssentially, i'm letting my back end rendered DOM, drive what should be converted to React Components as I don't have the freedom to render on the back. But, when following this route, it works fine always except for in IE8, `onChange` events aren't fired.\n\nI think it may have something to do with the fact that i'm calling `React.createElement` with a component instance instead of a string. So if that is the case, it either should reject the component instance, or the events should trigger properly.\n",
