  "body": "@syranide @jimfb \n\nThis issue of `<input />` vs `<input value={null} />` has been around for over a year now but I still can't understand the thinking behind the reasoning you give to all the issues that raise it.\n\nI apologise if the following indicates I am misunderstanding something. Please clarify for me what I seem to not understand.\n\nCould you please give an example of where a developer may use `<input value={null} />` for an uncontrolled input.\n\nBecause to me it seems React only \"sees\" such if a developer did something like `<input value={x} />` and `x` happens to be null (`let x = null`). This, in terms of intention, means `x` may be a non-null value later. This should leave the component as a controlled component. My understanding is that React already does this. My issue is about the warning it gives.\n\nCurrently, React 15.x.x gives a warning when it encounters <input value={null} /> and it says the value should not be null but rather an empty string or undefined, depending on whether you want a controlled vs uncontrolled input. The release notes for v15.0.0 say React treats this as an intention to clear the input. Can this warning be dropped because it may lead developers to having `let value = value || \"\"` all over their code, especially if using async store patterns where values may get set at a later point. This leads to the mistake of losing a value of 0 in some instances (or all).\n\nTo me it seems like this is something that should be in docs and not a warning in code. I have yet to see a case where a developer uses the value prop on an uncontrolled input. This is a direct result of lack of cases where a controlled input is changed to an uncontrolled input. In that case, Reach should encourage developers to be more explicit in their intention by having some flow control mechanism that returns a different component altogether instead of setting the same controlled input to null.\n",
