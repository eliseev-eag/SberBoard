Error boundaries stop the double reporting, but only handle errors thrown in render, not errors in handlers etc.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/ebsrpraL/).**\r\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/GMjEpx?editors=0010\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nJust one error thrown\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16.0.0-rc.2",
