  "body": "Proper implementation of #1448, because now there's something factual to discuss.\n\nThe DOM now statelessly reflects the props provided to DOM components.  No more `getDefaultValueForProperty`. `\"\"`, `null` and `undefined` no longer behave differently depending on the value being an attribute or property, with `\"\"` being an actual value and distinct from `null` and `undefined`. I would dare say that this is the _correct_ fix for #1431.\n\nAs is mentioned and benchmarked in the #1448, there should be a theoretically _measurable_ impact of this (in _some_ browsers). But I dare anyone to suggest a reasonable real-life use-case where it is actually at all measurable (unless my benchmark is flawed).\n\n---\n\nIf we want to push the performance of edge-browsers to the limit, we could conditionally make the default type be attribute (instead of property) as FF and Chrome perform significantly better, but they're basically an order of magnitude faster already making it quite pointless (and fragile) IMHO.\n\nBasic tests added, removed an existing test (that has been half-broken) as it no longer makes sense.\n\n```\n   raw     gz Compared to master @ 32b84a4c5ea32835b93a857cf00f0db86d6c755a\n     =      = build/JSXTransformer-previous.js\n     =      = build/JSXTransformer.js\n     =      = build/react-previous.min.js\n     =      = build/react-test.js\n  -580   -172 build/react-with-addons.js\n  -151    -60 build/react-with-addons.min.js\n  -580   -169 build/react.js\n  -150    -53 build/react.min.js\n```\n",
