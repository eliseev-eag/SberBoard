Even if a callback is cancelled, it's still in the\r\n'pendingCallbacks' queue until the rAF runs, and we only schedule a rAF\r\nwhen there are pendingCallbacks in the queue.\r\n\r\nBut since this is obviously wrong, going to fix it.\r\n\r\nWe will be adding a regression test in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nTo fix a random bug which was popping up.\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nAdding a regression unit test in a follow-up PR.",
