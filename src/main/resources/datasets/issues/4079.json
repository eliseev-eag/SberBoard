  "body": "I must be missing something pretty trivial, but I can't get key handler events working in Android Chrome. Here's a jsfiddle that reproduces the behavior I'm seeing: https://jsfiddle.net/waLcu83e/1/\n\nEverywhere but Android Chrome I get the desired results when typing in the input:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/421270/8087684/a3213ade-0f59-11e5-81a7-2427c90d9778.png)\n\nOn Android the events are different/wrong:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/421270/8087911/d828162a-0f5a-11e5-92c6-9f89ea7431b5.png)\n- `ev.which` is 229 (or 0 on some devices) for all the events\n- `onKeyPress` isn't fired\n- If the first character typed is a number, the events are correct\n- Moving the handlers to the input element behaves the same\n\nThe stock browser in the emulator seems to work fine, iOS, etc as well. Like I said, I imagine there must be some simple mistake but I sure don't see what it is\n",
