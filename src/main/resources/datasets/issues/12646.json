  "body": "Hi guys,\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nPossibly a bug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nThere is an issue when HoC update the props that they pass down to their child components.\r\n\r\nAs a example: `react-apollo` has a  `Query` HoC component that does a query for data on the server and when the data is fetched it passes it down to the `children`.\r\n\r\nWhen we use `componentWillReceiveProps` the `nextProps` is updated with the new props, the contrary happens with `getDerivedStateFromProps` which is called only the first time.\r\n\r\nExample Code\r\n```\r\nclass A extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <Query query={GET_DATA}>\r\n        {({ data }) => <B data={data} />}\r\n      </Query>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass B extends React.Component {\r\n  static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, prevState) {\r\n    console.log(nextProps)\r\n    return null\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe first time the `data` obj is empty than is filled with the response.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.3.2\r\n\r\nThank You!",
