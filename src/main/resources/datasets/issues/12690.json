  "body": "Fixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12688. This is not just related to legacy context: as far as I can tell from the test I added, we're currently re-rendering all `forwardRef` components on a deeper `setState`. This seems bad.\r\n\r\nI changed memoization to store the `props` instead of the returned child. Not sure if it matters. Maybe for DevTools?\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure if what I'm doing here is safe. Can `ref` provided by React ever be different in this scenario and \"justify\" re-render?",
