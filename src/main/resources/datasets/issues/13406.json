  "body": "* Replace the contract for injected `invokeGuardedCallback`: instead of writing to two fields, call `this.onError`. I think this is clearer and less fragile. Ironically it's also closer to the [actual www API](https://fburl.com/qib8pelv).\r\n* That lets us convert those fields to variables and convert methods to ESM (hopefully helps a tiny bit with bundle size?)\r\n* Change the www shim â€” we can simplify this during next sync but for now I made it work with old API.\r\n* Rename `invokeGuardedCallback` to `invokeGuardedCallbackImpl` to avoid accidentally importing it directly.",
