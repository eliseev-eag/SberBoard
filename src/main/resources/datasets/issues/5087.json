  "body": "I want to place a widget multiple places in the DOM. \n\n```\na = getFancyWidget();\nreturn <div>\n        <span>{a}</span>\n        {/* main content*/}\n        <span>{a}</span>\n</div>\n```\n\nI have not seen any code that does it. So I wonder if its safe, that it does not mess with react internals. It works with a minimal example.\n\nI want to make a stacked tables implementation like https://johnpolacek.github.io/stacktable.js . For a 3-row table, each `tr` is placed twice, a `td` is placed 4 times. \n\nIn responsive mode in a stacked table, each row is displayed as a 2-column key-value table. It does this by turning each table into a table+stacked table set combo and then using a media query to show either the table or stacked table set.\n",
