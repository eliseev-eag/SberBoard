  "body": "Added EventPluginHub Flow types. Please note, I ran into a weird bug in Flow where the order of the union types mattered. It's why one would see these sort of diffs in two of the files:\r\n\r\n-  current: ?(T | Array<T>),\r\n+  current: ?(Array<T> | T),\r\n\r\nTomorrow, I'll check the Flow project to see if there is already an open issue or resolution regarding the bug.",
