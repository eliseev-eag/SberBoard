  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to do something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst Container = (props) => props.someCondition? (\r\n    <ContainerType1>\r\n        {props.children}\r\n    </ContainerType1>\r\n) : (\r\n    <ContainerType2>\r\n        {props.children}\r\n    </ContainerType2>\r\n);\r\n\r\nconst App = (props) => (\r\n    <Container someCondition={props.someCondition} >\r\n        <ComponentThatDoesAsyncFetches1 />\r\n        <ComponentThatDoesAsyncFetches2 />\r\n        <ComponentThatDoesAsyncFetches3 />\r\n    </Container>\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically what I want is a situation where App is rerendering on a changing boolean prop (Imagine someCondition has an actual changing value), and a different container will render depending on its value, while maintaining the same children inside. Problem is, that those children are doing async fetches (on DidMount), but they re-mount and lose their state while the containers change. \r\n\r\nAny idea how can I achieve this with the children still mounted even if their parent changed?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n",
