  "body": "I have noticed lately that my app is throwing the following warning on load:\n\n```\nReact attempted to use reuse markup in a container but the checksum was invalid. This generally means that you are using server rendering and the markup generated on the server was not what the client was expecting. React injectednew markup to compensate which works but you have lost many of the benefits of server rendering. Instead, figure out why the markup being generated is different on the client or server. \n```\n\nAfter running through the code in the debugger, I've found the only difference between the generated markup and in-page `container.outerHTML` is a lot of lines like the following:\n\n```\n-<img src=\"img&#x2f;3.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-reactid=\".2dfcwnqnrb4.2.0.0.0.1.1.2.0.0\">\n+<img src=\"img/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-reactid=\".2dfcwnqnrb4.2.0.0.0.1.1.2.0.0\">\n...\n-<li data-reactid=\".2dfcwnqnrb4.1.0.5.1.3\"><a href=\"&#x2f;myAccount\" data-reactid=\".2dfcwnqnrb4.1.0.5.1.3.0\">My Account</a>\n+<li data-reactid=\".2dfcwnqnrb4.1.0.5.1.3\"><a href=\"/myAccount\" data-reactid=\".2dfcwnqnrb4.1.0.5.1.3.0\">My Account</a>\n```\n\nThe in-browser generated markup includes the `&#x2f;`, not the prerendered page. Is something misconfigured, or is this a bug?\n",
