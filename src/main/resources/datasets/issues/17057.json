Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-example-25khw\r\n\r\nNotably, look at the tree in DevTools. The name of the component that was wrapped twice shows up as \"undefined\".\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nWhen following code pattern described in the React docs for applying custom names to forwardRefs, you should be able to use a HOC multiple times or use multiple HOCs and still preserve the original component's name.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the object returned [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/c898020e015f4ee6f793a652668d6d78b0d43e76/packages/react/src/forwardRef.js) should also have a 'displayName' field?\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nI discovered this in a project that is on React 16.8.6, but the codesandbox example shows the issue in 16.10.0.",
