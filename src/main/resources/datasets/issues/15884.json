  "body": "(Sorry for the multiple edits, but the template really confused me)\r\n\r\n\r\nBug:\r\n\r\nWhen having a variable number of arguments, such as this sample\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction useSomething(fixedArg, ...args) {\r\n  //Somewhere inside:\r\n   return useMemo(() => /* doSomething */, [fixedArg, ...args])\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe eslint plugin fixes it to:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction useSomething(fixedArg, ...args) {\r\n  //Somewhere inside:\r\n   return useMemo(() => /* doSomething */, [fixedArg, args])\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not correct.  The dots on the rest of the arguments should not be dropped, as the dependencies to be compared are the contents of that array (the values passed), not the array itself.   I don't know how the *rest parameters*  array is assembled by the JavaScript interpreter but my guess it is dynamically assembled, meaning there is a new one every time, which would fail a shallow equality comparison, even when the arguments themselves remain the same.\r\n\r\n",
