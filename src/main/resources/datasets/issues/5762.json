  "body": "makes an attempt at fixing #4251.\n\nFirst, I added support for native mouseenter and mouseleave, I am not sure why they weren't used before, there may have been a good reason I didn't realize :)\n\nThis drastically changes how enter|leave is implemented, modeled after the jQuery approach. I tried to keep with the current implementation but browsers just don't fire the necessary mouse events so it seemed that there was no way to \"fix\" the current approach.\n\nThe EnterLeave logic is pretty deeply integrated so I am not sure I added the various utils in the right spot to maintain correct encapsulation.\n\nWhile fairly easy to implement with normal handlers the React event system made this sort of tough since you don't know interested nodes. One concern with this approach is that it needs to walk up the instance tree for every mouseout|over event fired to try and find a parent node listening for enter|leave. I thought this approach was more in keeping with how stuff works other places, but I wasn't sure if it represents an unacceptable philosophical or perf concern (my light testing didn't seem to indicate that).\n\nAlternatively I could have just used the didPutListener hook to manually attach mouse over|out listeners.\n\nThere could also be a hook or accumulation pattern that does this already that I missed.\n\nthanks for all the hard work ya'll and Happy new years!\n",
