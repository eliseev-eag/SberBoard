  "body": "This PR replaces the traditional event delegation technique employed by React with direct attachment to DOM nodes. This is just an investigation. I'm attracted to it for a number of reasons:\r\n\r\n1. We can remove a lot of code\r\n2. This is another way of addressing scroll jank issues (https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9333) \r\n3. This _might_ fix some issues with disabled interactive element bubbling. I do not know.\r\n4. I might discover a nice middle-ground that is ultimately better.\r\n\r\nIntuitively, event delegation should be faster. It does less work. However I want to figure out _how_ much faster it really is, particularly on weaker devices and IE 9/10. I'm curious about:\r\n\r\n- Start up time\r\n- Memory usage\r\n- Ongoing update costs\r\n\r\nI put up a build here:\r\n\r\n**production:**\r\nhttp://react-local-listeners.surge.sh/react.production.min.js\r\nhttp://react-local-listeners.surge.sh/react-dom.production.min.js\r\n\r\n**development:**\r\nhttp://react-local-listeners.surge.sh/react.development.js\r\nhttp://react-local-listeners.surge.sh/react-dom.development.js\r\n\r\nNow to find some benchmarks.",
