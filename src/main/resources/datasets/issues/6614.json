Strangely, if I change document mode from \"Edge (Default)\" to \"10\" React 15 still behaves as expected.\n\nReading the changelog for R15, this change sounds like it could be related:\n\n> Input events are handled more reliably in IE 10 and IE 11; spurious events no longer fire when using a placeholder.\n> @jquense in #4051\n",
