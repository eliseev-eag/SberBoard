  "body": "To fix https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14481.\r\n\r\nThis matches the feature set enabled in 16.7 alpha â€” even though we won't actually ship ConcurrentMode in the next minor. We'll need to have another discussion about what `next` tag means and whether it should be more like RCs (with `future` tag pointing to all-included builds). But I think this discussion can wait until we ship Hooks in a stable.\r\n\r\nThis release is mostly motivated by fixing https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14481#issuecomment-451700486.",
