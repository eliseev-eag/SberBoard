  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\n\nReport a bug.\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\n\nSeveral versions of `react-addons-pure-render-mixin` (specifically, versions 0.14.4 through 0.14.8) have been published on npm which specify non-existent versions of React as peer dependencies. (0.14.4 has `react@^0.14.4`, 0.14.5 has `react@^0.14.5`, etc.)\n\nI assume this is a bug in the release process for the mixin, where it assumes that an equivalent React version will always exist.\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\n\n`npm i react@0.14 react-addons-pure-render-mixin@0.14` will throw a peer dependency warning, because react-addons-pure-render-mixin resolves to 0.14.8 which wants at least react@0.14.8 (which doesn't exist), whereas react@0.14 can't resolve to anything above 0.14.3.\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n\n`npm i react@0.14 react-addons-pure-render-mixin@0.14` should install the latest 0.14 versions of each package without throwing any warnings.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\n0.14.4 through 0.14.8\n",
