Could React warn user when this happens, something like \"Looks like you tried to supply a key, but the value supplied is undefined. Check the render...\" and so on?\r\n\r\nI think it might make sense to give a more specific warning in this case. Open to suggestions about specific wording and in which case it would be used.",
