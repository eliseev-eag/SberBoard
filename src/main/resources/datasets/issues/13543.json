  "body": "This is mostly all rote search-and-replace.\r\n\r\nThe only commit that seems sketchy is the last oneâ€“ c84b3d6. I couldn't get our packages or suspense fixtures to install correctly. Yarn seemed to want to pull the `schedule` dependency from NPM even though I'd told it to install the local version. This resulted in two packages being installed: one in `node_modules` and one in `node_modules/react-dom/node_modules`. So I added a pre script to remove the redundant one.\r\n\r\nWe can also test our fixtures without this hack by publishing `schedule` version 0.2.0 to NPM (which will also unblock the React Native sync).\r\n\r\nI'm going to step away for a bit (holiday in the US) but I'll check back later... ðŸ˜„ ",
