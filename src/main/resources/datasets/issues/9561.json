  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nbug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nReact allows a dot in a controlled input that doesn't allow changing the value, if the value set as a prop is a number. If it's a string the issue is not present.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/23/\r\n\r\nIn this example the first input allows a dot, even though the code doesn't allow changes. The second input doesn't allow the dot.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe dot shouldn't be allowed.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nversion 15.5.4, Chrome and Firefox (see the jsfiddle example)",
