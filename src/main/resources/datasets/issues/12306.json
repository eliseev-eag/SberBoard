  "body": "New context API is really great, a lot of thanks for your efforts on this. It enabled us by a more efficient and easier way to write React app.\r\n\r\nBut, I still consider it as too much boilerplate/verbosity to use it on each leaf component. Everytime, you may write like this:\r\n```jsx\r\n  funciton ContextWrapperComp() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <ThemeContext.Consumer>\r\n        {({value}) => <RealComp value={value} />}\r\n      </ThemeContext.Consumer>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nSo I published a npm package -- https://github.com/SunHuawei/with-context. I think it is the easiest way to use the new context API. You could use it as a decorator, like this:\r\n```jsx\r\n// export withTheme in some place\r\nimport { withContext } from \"with-context\";\r\nexport const withTheme = withContext(ThemeContext, \"theme\");\r\n```\r\n```jsx\r\n// import withTheme, and use it anywhere\r\nimport { withTheme } from \"./withTheme\";\r\n\r\n@withTheme\r\nexport default class LeafComponent extends React.PureComponent {\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not suggesting adding this as a official implement, nor you would do that I think. Just, please give it a try and tell me what do you think, really appreciate your attention.",
