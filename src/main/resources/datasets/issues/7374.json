  "body": "I've asked the same question [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38639896/return-raw-html-as-from-jquerydiv-div-from-an-unmounted-react-component) but it seems that the only way is to use `ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup(component)` which must be a mounted component first, and I'd just like to feed raw HTML to a plugin like the above linked question.\n\nI also like to avoid jQuery with this, and just have a way to mount a component in the `shadow`, and then have the raw HTML ( not sure how it's called, when you console.log a html element, in chrome it outputs the html as a sort of native html object )\n\nThe only other way I can imagine is using a `ref` to an element, but that still has to be mounted.\n",
