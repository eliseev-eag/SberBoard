  "body": "Clicking `<a>` within SVGs cause issues, in my case missing `<rect>`s. \nOn initial load you ought to see 5 boxes(light brown, red, blue, brown and orange).\n1. Click 1. Now its 3 boxes (blue, brown and orange).\n2. Click 2. Now its 2 boxes (light brown and red).\n3. Again click on 1. 2 boxes :worried: (blue and brown)\n\nWhere does the orange box disappear to??? :confused: Please note this entire thing is SVG and that the link is actually present in the DOM. It just decided not to show itself.\n\nOn Firefox, clicking the link, `TypeError: setting a property that has only a getter` is thrown from  react.js:2059:10 version `0.13.2`.\n\nI initially thought it was a [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) specific issue. \n[Issue w/ React-router](https://jsfiddle.net/LLv2tfm3/)\n\nWrong!!! The same issue exists without the library.\n[Issue w/o React-router](https://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/7889/)\n\nBut it doesn't when using a normal SVG element.\n[No issue w/o React](https://jsfiddle.net/25jt11qm/1/)\n\n> SVG elements\n> The following SVG elements are supported:\n> circle defs ellipse g line linearGradient mask path pattern polygon polyline\n> radialGradient rect stop svg text tspan\n\n[Source](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tags-and-attributes.html)\n\nAlthough if React doesn't support `<a>` within SVGs it ought to throw an error or something.\n\nWhats the cause of this issue? I'm guessing going with `onClick` would be the viable option right now.\n",
