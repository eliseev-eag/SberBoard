  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nfeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIn React 16, the `data-react-checksum` attribute was removed from the server rendered markup. In previous versions, we used this attribute to beacon checksum mismatches to our log servers to be notified of production issues. With the attribute removed, we have no mechanism to determine if a checksum mismatch occurred.\r\n\r\nI'm aware that checksum issues no longer cause the entire DOM to re-render, however, it is still important that we know when they do occur. A typical use case is when we display ads or autoplay video. We want to know if an ad gets re-rendered (double counted) or an autoplay video is interrupted due to React re-rendering the DOM.\r\n\r\nOther related bugs/requests:\r\n- Ability to debug checksums in production - https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10016\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe solution does not necessarily need to re-introduce the checksum attribute again. It could be some other event, hook, or callback that applications can leverage to handle checksum issues.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n- React 16\r\n- All browsers\r\n- Worked in  <= React 15\r\n",
