  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nfeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nthe shallow renderer does not run componentDidUpdate, componentDidMount, or useEffect functions. (I'll call them effect functions for short)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nSee [this enzyme issue](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/issues/1938#issuecomment-476137018) for more details about where this request is coming from. But the general idea is that it is often nice to run effect functions even when shallow rendering, rather than having to use full rendering on those specific tests. \r\n\r\nIf the shallow renderer provided an option to run the effect functions, it would allow people who test with shallow rendering to more easily test their components. Enzyme currently supports this in class components by calling componentDidUpdate/mount directly on the component instance, but this would be a much harder thing to do for hooks, since they are usually anonymous.\r\n\r\nEnzyme used to not allow this at all, but then added an option to turn on this behavior in their shallow renderer, before finally turning it on by default and then adding an option to turn it off. It didn't seem to cause too many issues for them, so I think this approach could work well for the React shallow renderer as well. Obviously I'm only asking for an option to turn it on now, not to change the default or anything.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nAll and no it was never supported AFAIK",
