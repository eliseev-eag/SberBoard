  "body": "This was a change from v0.12 -> v0.13 but I only just now noticed it. Essentially I had a component that did something like this:\n\n```\ncomponentDidMount() {\n  if (this.props.value == '') {\n    this.refs['select'].getDOMNode().selectedIndex = -1;\n  }\n}\n\nrender() {\n  return <select ref=\"select\" value={this.props.value}>\n    <option value=\"Yes\">Yes</option>\n    <option value=\"No\">No</option>\n  </select>\n}\n```\n\nThis meant that if a blank value was provided, the select would display nothing by setting `selectedIndex`. However, in v0.13 [this was added](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/0.13-stable/src/browser/ui/dom/components/ReactDOMSelect.js#L92) which effectively kills this behavior. I think I understand why it was changed since it better matches what the browser shows by default, but I'm trying to figure out a way to still be able to blank a select element without adding an extra blank option element.\n",
