  "body": "Refs #1350\n\nThis PR is mainly to start a conversation. I'm not sure if this is the ideal implementation, and tests need to be added regardless. But I wanted to get some feedback before investing further time.\n\nI'm building a new editor view for Atom with React, and selection restoration is costing ~2ms when handling text insertions. I'd like to selectively disable it for the hidden input element that receives input events on behalf of the editor.\n\nWith selection restoration:\n![screenshot_2014-04-23_09_11_00](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/2779455/369cf1ac-cafc-11e3-8189-3a5b1d719d80.png)\n\nWithout selection restoration:\n![screenshot 2014-04-23 09 14 27](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/2779392/8b98a5a8-cafb-11e3-8cfb-9fbcf68e393c.png)\n\nIdeally I'd like to check a property on the component corresponding to the input node, like `unsafeSkipSelectionRestoration`, but I couldn't figure out how to map the raw DOM node back to the react component that originated it. Is there any global mapping of react id's to component instances?\n",
