Semver was used in various scripts ([ex here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/060581b1287ea75d128f8f6b2b7bf494fe5db4fa/scripts/rollup/plugins/use-forks-plugin.js#L10)) without being listed, which was invalid (it worked because one of React's dependencies was itself depending on semver, which was then hoisted to the top-level through package managers optimizations).\r\n",
