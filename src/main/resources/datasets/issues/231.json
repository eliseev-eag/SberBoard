  "body": "Guys, I'm starting my holidays next week, and also I need this in one of my projects.\n\nI was discussing this with @zpao in one of issue discussions here. \n\nBasically the idea is to take ember-rails code and use it to expose react.js and jsxtransformer.js in assets/.\n\nSecond thing would be to register sprockets engine to transform JSX, we could steal a bit of code from [https://github.com/leshill/handlebars_assets](https://github.com/leshill/handlebars_assets) and using execjs run jsxtransformer. I already tested all this and it works ok. Good thing we have a patch merged to allow jsx transformation using non-node, non-browser JS environment: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/217\n\nIf no one is in a hurry about this, I would start making this gem, restructure the repo a bit (move all gem files into gems/ dir) and make all that's necessary to have a proper react-rails gem. I should be ready with an initial version of this some time next week.\n\nPR will follow.\n",
