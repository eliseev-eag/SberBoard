I suppose it's related to the fact that `for` is a javascript keyword, but as far as I know, there's no public API allowing to use a `for` property as a loop instruction? Wouldn't it be a better API that applies the principle of least surprise here, instead of having us to remember specificity that has no actual impact on how we use the API? (actually, I realize the same could go with `class`/`className`).\r\n",
