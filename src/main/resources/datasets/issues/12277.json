Then it would be great if directly on import an error is thrown if the module combination is invalid (independent of Webpack or process.env.NODE_ENV - because maybe the user of the add-on library will use some other tools).\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Assume that this is \"fancy-react-addon.production.min.js\"\r\n\r\nif (React.environment !== 'production') {\r\n    throw new Error(\"You have to use React's production packages [... some details ...]\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOf course there are also some other use cases where this feature would also be handy or even necessary, but I hope the above use case is already convincing.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n \r\n16.2.0",
