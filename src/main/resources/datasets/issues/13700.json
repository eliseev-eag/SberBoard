Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n5. Run `yarn test-prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) typechecks (`yarn flow`).\r\n10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n**Learn more about contributing:** https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n",
