  "body": "Summary:\nRight now, if a component specifies a propType as, for example, `myProp: React.PropTypes.shape`, without an actual shape parameter, any prop type will be accepted, because `React.PropTypes.shape` returns a function (the actual validator), not an Error, indicating that propType checking passed.\n\nThis can create an unfortunate situation where a component looks like it has fully specified `propTypes`, but in fact does not.\n\nThis commit addresses this by making `React.PropTypes.shape` et al. warn if they are passed arguments from propType checking rather than the single argument expected at creation time.\n\nAlternatively, we could check that only `null` or instances of `Error` are returned from propType functions, but given there is a test case testing that this is not true for custom components, I wasn't sure if that was the right way to implement this.\n\nTest Plan:\nAdded unit tests; ran `jest` in the root repo directory.\nAlso ran `grunt lint` and `grunt test`\n",
