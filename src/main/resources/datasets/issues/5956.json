  "body": "I currently have a working example of a project that uses the latest React + TypeScript (using .tsx files), together with the AMD module loading system (with require.js) and building/running/debugging in Visual Studio 2015 CE.\n\nHowever, if I now try to nest 2 React components into a \"parent\" React component, I am getting exceptions in require.js when running the app...\n\nThe \"child\" React components are working fine individually, so the problem really seems to come from the nesting itself.\n\nIf I run the same project using an older version of React (13.x) and not using AMD modules, then the app works fine, also when nesting the React components.\n\nI've made a test repository public here: https://bitbucket.org/KoenT_IM/typescriptreactvs2015tests \n- HelloPenguin is the old project (using React 13.x and not using AMD)\n- HelloPenguin_React0.14.6_AMD is the new project (latest React 0.14.6 and using AMD)\n  If you remove lines 41 and 42 in ApplicationView.tsx, you will see that the app runs fine, and the individual React components also work fine.\n\nThis must be something I'm overlooking, but I can't seem to pin it down...\nDoes anyone know what could be wrong here and how to fix this problem?\nThanks!\n",
