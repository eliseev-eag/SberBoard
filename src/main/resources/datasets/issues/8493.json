  "body": "I'm using a direct snippet from my personal website, that I can safely assume has it uses widely. \r\n\r\nSomewhere in the render function:\r\n```\r\nconst emailAddress = \"&#115;&#111;&#109;&#101;&#32;&#101;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;\";\r\nconst mailToAddress = `mailto:${emailAddress}`;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd a part of the larger code to render:\r\n```\r\n<address className=\"icons\">\r\n        // Lots more stuff here..\r\n        <a href={mailToAddress} className=\"icon-envelope\"></a>\r\n</address>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above won't work. The problem here is the `href` with the mailTo. React re-encodes all of this. In order to avoid this, the well known way is to use `dangerouslySetInnerHtml`. However, it makes no sense to use it here, since it's a part of a much larger element. And you cannot just set attributes this way, you have to set the whole element. \r\n\r\nAnd this phenomenon is encountered quite often in many scenarios. Personally, I think the whole `dangerouslySetInnerHtml` is over-engineered. Real use cases scenarios, for protecting vital stuff, programmers generally use well known api to encode anyway - this is really pointless in real life practical scenarios - the only thing it gives you is headaches. This often just makes you jump through hoops to perform very simple stuff. \r\n\r\nWould greatly appreciate any suggestion of how to handle the above mentioned scenarios. Thanks.\r\n\r\nPS: The entire address block above is cleanly abstracted into one component which can be found here:\r\nhttps://github.com/prasannavl/prasannavl.com/blob/master/src/components/fragments/Address.tsx",
