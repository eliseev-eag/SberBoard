I am succesfully able to log the ref to the console:\r\n```Javascript\r\nconsole.log(this.div) => <div>Click Me</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nI've put up a repo to reproduce the problem:\r\nhttps://github.com/ajwann/react-ref-debugger-issue\r\n\r\nYou can follow these steps to reproduce the issue:\r\n1) clone the repo\r\n2) run ```yarn install && yarn start``` in the root of the repo\r\n3) open Chrome  dev tools\r\n4) click the text on the landing page that just says 'Click Me' \r\n\r\nYou will end up in a debugger in an onClick callback, and if you try to access ```this.div``` you will get the previously mentioned error.\r\nHowever once you continue past the debugger, you can see that the value of ```this.div``` is correctly logged to the console, and *was* really available in the callback method.\r\n \r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would expect to be able to access instance properties with ref values from within a debugger.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n1) React version 16.6.3\r\n2) Chrome and Chrome variants\r\n3) I don't know\r\n",
