  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nIt is a bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nI am using Webpack to built React based app - [pgAdmin4](https://github.com/postgres/pgadmin4)\r\n\r\nThe app runs in two modes:\r\n1. Desktop (aka runtime) mode - It opens in Webkit browser.\r\n2. Server mode - It opens in any of the browsers such as Chrome, Firefox etc.\r\n\r\nI am getting the error when the app is built(using webpack) with development flag enabled. \r\n\r\nIt works fine in production mode.\r\n```\r\nscritps: {\r\n    \"webpacker\": \"yarn run webpack -- --config webpack.config.js\",\r\n    \"bundle:prod\":  \"cross-env NODE_ENV=production yarn run webpacker\"\r\n    \"bundle:dev\": \"yarn run webpacker\",\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/ebsrpraL/).**\r\n\r\nSince the app is run on Webkit browser, It is not possible to provide a test environment. However, If anyone wants, he can build using the steps provided in [README](https://github.com/postgres/pgadmin4) or this blog [post](https://imsurinder90.github.io/posts/install_qt5.8_with_webkit_on_macosx)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe React base app should run without any error in dev mode.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact v15.4.2\r\nOS - Mac OS X Yosemite(10.10.2)\r\nBrowser - annulen QtWebkit-58 Browser \r\nQt version - Qt5.8.0\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need more details.\r\n\r\n",
