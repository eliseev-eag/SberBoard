Click on the comment icon for an article with lots of comments and wait for them to load.\n\nIn Chrome render performance as well as collapsing a thread (by clicking on a comment) is near instant. In Safari, it will freeze the browser for 10-20 seconds.\n\nCode for the comments render:\nhttps://github.com/reapp/hacker-news-app/blob/master/app/components/articles/Comment.jsx\n\nEven without the dangerouslySetInnerHtml I see really slow performance in Safari. If I remove the comment text altogether it speeds up dramatically, so that is the source of the slowness. Should I put together a smaller demo?\n",
