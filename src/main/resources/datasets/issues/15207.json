However there is still an issue with the current implementation.\r\n\r\n`React.memo` does not forward displayName for tests. In snapshots, components display as `<Component />` and string assertions such as `.find('MyMemoizedComponent')` won't work.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n`React.memo` should forward displayName for the test renderer.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n* React 16.8.5\r\n* Jest 24.5.0\r\n* enzyme 3.9.0\r\n* enzyme-adapter-react-16 1.11.2\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nN.B. - Potentially related to https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14319, but this is related to the more recent changes to support `memo` in the test renderer. Please close if needed, I'm quite new here!\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to submit a PR if the issue is not too complex to look into :smile: ",
