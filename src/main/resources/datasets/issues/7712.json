  "body": "I'd like to keep traditional server side rendering (not react rendering with node) and attach client side code.  \nI believe the following statement might help to achieve that. I wonder if any work is being done.  \nOr any help or guide on how to mix server rendered content (via server side template such as jinja2 ) with react at the moment would be greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html states that \n\n> ReactDOM.render() does not modify the container node (only modifies the children of the container). In the future, it may be possible to insert a component to an existing DOM node without overwriting the existing children.\n",
