  "body": "If you have multiple children leaving at the same time, the TG will re-render its children after each child's leave is complete. There will be 20 re-renders if 20 children were leaving within one render of their parent. \n\nThis creates a clearly visible bottleneck if you have a large volume of children and when their parent gets quick re-renders.\n\nOne example is a search/filter with a large list of filtered items entering and leaving as the user types -- you have to display all filtered items, however many, so that the user can stop typing and scroll if they'd like. I've seen visible bottleneck with just 30 items as I type in 4 letters (4 re-renders from parent).\n\nThis commit fixes the performance issue by keeping track of all currently leaving children (which are also added from `performAppear`/`performEnter`) and only trigger re-render after the last leaving child's leave is complete.\n",
