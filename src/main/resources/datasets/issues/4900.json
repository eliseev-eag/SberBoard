  "body": "Current defensive termination clause is **far broader** defensive than original Apache License 2, which makes difficult to use it in enterprise. It is now covering any actions against any part of Facebook, while previous Apache License covers only this project.\n\nI don't know where to address this issue (e.g. couldn't find a contact at [https://code.facebook.com/projects/]()), so created an issue here. Please forward this issue to Facebook legal / opensource team.\n\nFrom [PATENT in v0.13.3](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/v0.13.3/PATENTS)\n\n```\nThe license granted hereunder will terminate, automatically and without notice,\nif you (or any of your subsidiaries, corporate affiliates or agents) initiate\ndirectly or indirectly, or take a direct financial interest in, any Patent\nAssertion: (i) against Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or corporate\naffiliates, (ii) against any party if such Patent Assertion arises in whole or\nin part from any software, technology, product or service of Facebook or any of\nits subsidiaries or corporate affiliates, or (iii) against any party relating\nto the Software. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Facebook or any of its\nsubsidiaries or corporate affiliates files a lawsuit alleging patent\ninfringement against you in the first instance, and you respond by filing a\npatent infringement counterclaim in that lawsuit against that party that is\nunrelated to the Software, the license granted hereunder will not terminate\nunder section (i) of this paragraph due to such counterclaim.\n```\n\nRelated part from [LICENSE at v11.2](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/v0.11.2/LICENSE)\n\n```\n   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n```\n\nRelated\n- #3554 \n- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9271331\n",
