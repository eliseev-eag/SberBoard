  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nRequesting a feature. As far as my knowledge (Sorry if I am wrong), currently I can't able to find whether an event is a valid synthetic event for a html DOM element. For example onChange is a valid event for <input type=\"text\" />. It would be helpful if we have an API to check whether given method is a valid synthetic event for the html element.\r\n**Use case:**\r\n  Lets say I write a component which has <input /> as child, I would like to pass in synthetic event as props to the parent component. In the child component I would loop to see if a prop is a valid synthetic element and attach as props to the child element. If not don't attach to the HTML element.\r\n\r\nIn parent component \r\n`<Child onEnter = ... onClick = .... All synthetic events ... />`\r\n \r\nIn child component I will render this\r\n`<input  {...validSyntheticEventsCallback}  name=\"name\"  ... /> `                                                     \r\n\r\nvalidSyntheticEventsCallback will include all the props that are valid synthetic events. This will help in making parent components more generic to write. Also all those logic can be included in the parent component itself.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nCurrently we need to manually assign every event with the DOM.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nIt is not related to browser / OS / version issue. ",
