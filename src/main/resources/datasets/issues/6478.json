  "body": "Prior to v15 an input tag like `<input value=\"hello\" />` would be found by a Sizzle/jQuery query like `':text[value=hello]'`. Since v15 the same query returns 0 results. If I reduce the query to `:text` and check its `.value`, sure enough the output is `\"hello\"`.\n\nIf you're wondering what I'm doing, I use Sizzle both directly in my unit tests to assert React output, and indirectly in a DOM-zipper library also for testing.\n",
