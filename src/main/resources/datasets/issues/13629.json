  "body": "I want to run some tests both in Fire and normal modes (https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13628).\r\n\r\nBut for that I need tests to switch on `ReactFeatureFlags` and determine the expected behavior based on that. And this doesn't work in bundle tests so I'd have to make them internal.\r\n\r\nI don't want to make those tests internal. So instead I'm making a readonly version of `ReactFeatureFlags` available to bundle tests. That's sufficient to know in which mode we're running. If you attempt to write to it (as some our tests which need to stay internal do), this will throw.\r\n\r\nI could have used something like `process.env` for this instead. But it felt more confusing to me to have different ways to read a feature flag.",
