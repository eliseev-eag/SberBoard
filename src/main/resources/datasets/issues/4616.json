  "body": "I have read #3152 and #3879 but this seemed like maybe another but related problem.\n\nWhen the browser tries to bootstrap React and rerender the page I get this warning.\n\n```\nWarning: React attempted to reuse markup in a container but the checksum was invalid. \nThis generally means that you are using server rendering and the markup generated on \nthe server was not what the client was expecting. React injected new markup to compensate \nwhich works but you have lost many of the benefits of server rendering. Instead, figure \nout why the markup being generated is different on the client or server:\n (client) e6zyboqo.1.2.1.0.1\">&quot;This is a\n (server) e6zyboqo.1.2.1.0.1\">\"This is a test\n```\n\nApart from the case that it is unnecessary to escape the quote it seems to render differently on the server  and browser. This is just static content so I don't really understand why?\n\nThe markup to render the element is like this.\n\n```\n<p><strong>Next:</strong>\"This is a test\"</p>\n```\n\nHow come it's rendered different?\n",
