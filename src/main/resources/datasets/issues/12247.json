  "body": "(This is related to https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3965.)\r\n\r\nI'm working on a project with a lot of globally unique component instances. (In other words, their `key`s are essentially database IDs.) It also has DnD functionality. For reordering, everything is fine, but moving an instance from one parent to another causes a complete re-render of the instance.\r\n\r\nInstead of moving the nodes around myself, I was thinking of using Portals. Each instance has a prop for which element ID they should render inside. Then, to reparent them, it'd be a simple case of passing a different element ID. (I'm using Redux, so it'd just be a `string` in the state.)\r\n\r\nHowever, changing a Portal's container node also causes a complete re-render of everything passed to `ReactDOM.createPortal`. (See this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/PQQKRP).)\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to skip this re-rendering and effectively move the Portal contents instead?",
