  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nThis is a bug in the docs introduced by our migration to gatsby.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThere is an empty link on the ['Community > Where to get support' page](https://reactjs.org/community/support.html#facebook-and-twitter) at the very bottom. In the past, a twitter timeline was rendered there.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nYou should see a twitter timeline - see old version:\r\n<img width=\"1070\" alt=\"screenshot_with_old_twitter_timeline_highlighted\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1114467/30980356-a8b2ddd6-a435-11e7-8073-490a05bee0eb.png\">\r\n\r\nIt looks like [a script was added in this PR](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/68/files) and now that script isn't being loaded. I think that [adding the gatsby twitter plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-twitter/) would fix this, and if not we probably just need to tweak the gatsby twitter plugin.\r\n",
