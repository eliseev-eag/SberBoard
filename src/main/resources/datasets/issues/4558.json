  "body": "Alternate method of jumping to the root of the render tree.\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4511 is a nasty bug to fix, but the recent event work makes it slightly more likely that we'll hit this bug.  This change helps mitigate the issue by avoiding the calls to `ReactMount.getId()` that do invariant checks, thus allowing us to tiptoe around the underlying issue.\n\nOn a side note, there are some thoughts that this might be slightly faster too, so it might even be a perf win :).\n",
