  "body": "The TodoList component renders a list of `<li>` elements which don't have a unique key which raises the warning:  \n\n> Each child in an array should have a unique \"key\" prop. Check the render method of TodoList. See http://fb.me/react-warning-keys for more information.\n\nMy understanding is that it's done this way for the sake of simplicity and that the unique id is used for performant virtual DOM diffing. \n\nIs it a good idea having a warning raised for an example on the home page of react?\n\nsee: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/gh-pages/js/examples/todo.js\n",
