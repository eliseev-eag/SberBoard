  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nAdd a note to docs about preventDefault causing issues in change handlers for checkboxes/radios.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nThere is no such note about the issue in docs. I had made a PR ( #3069) for this before, it had been merged, but it got lost (removed?) in the new docs. I was helping someone through this exact issue, and they asked \"why isn't this covered in the docs?\".\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThere should be an explanatory note in the docs",
