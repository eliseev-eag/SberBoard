  "body": "Hi, \r\nI am using Snapshot testing for my application.\r\nMy application has a theme, based on some parameter passed to the component. The theme changes the look n feel of the app, by adding some classes to the elements.\r\n\r\nI want to generate snapshots for the components for both the themes.\r\nBut I do not want to duplicate the code or keep two separate .test/.spec files for this.\r\n\r\nIs there a way I can generate snapshot files based on what theme is passed, with just one spec file.\r\n\r\n#### Expected Behaviour:\r\nIf, two theme values are: dark and light\r\nOne Component.spec.js file should generate Component.dark.spec.js.snap or Component.light.spec.js.snap based on the theme passed.\r\n\r\nThis way I can have separate separate snapshots based on theme with just one source .spec file.\r\n\r\n",
