  "body": "When trying to debug performance locally, I was seeing really poor performance while using 0.13.0 for a fairly small dataset.\n\nI wrote up a quick benchmark, and it looks like that while 0.13.0 is around the same speed as 0.12.1 for prod, it's 2.5x slower in dev.\n\nBenchmark: http://jsperf.com/react-0-12-0-to-0-13-1-perf-regression\n\nRelevant screenshot:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/150329/6646478/7e7fa58e-c99b-11e4-9420-8a8131261cc8.png)\n",
