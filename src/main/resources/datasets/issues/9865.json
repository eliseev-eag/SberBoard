  "body": "Greetings React team,\r\n\r\nLet me start off by saying that I am a big fan of the work your team is doing and keep up the good work. With that said, one of the major disadvantages of React is that it sort of throws up when an exception is thrown in one of the lifecycle methods (i.e. null or undefined reference). Although this is ultimately up to the developer to ensure proper error handling, I was wondering if you would consider adding some additional component lifecycle method for catching unhandled exceptions (i.e. componentDidFail). From a developer perspective, this would make my life so much easier and really help to improve the quality of the applications I produce.\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n",
