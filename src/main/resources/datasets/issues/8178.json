  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nbug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nthe search input for the docs page @ https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html does nothing. Seems to not be firing a click handler for the search icon/magnifying glass.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\r\njust try to use the search bar https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt should search the docs. Does react index its docs through an internal search engine/service for search? Just curious\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nNo versions of react, just the docs page.`Chrome v 53.0.2785.143 `. Likely worked before, never actually tried to use search until now.\r\n",
