  "body": "I have a contentEditable element that I'm trying to capture key combos in, ie. CTRL + c.\n\nUsing `onKeyPress` doesn't seem possible because special keys aren't reported. `onKeyDown` also fails because you get one event for the CTRL key and one for the next key. I could check if `ctrlKey` is true, however that doesn't help me with obtaining the charCode for the key combo.\n\nA JSBin demo of what I'm trying to achieve: http://jsbin.com/girusifiba/edit?html,js,console,output (type CTRL + c in the editable `<div />`)\n\nAny advice on how to proceed would be appreciated!\n",
