However, when connecting an iPad with a Bluetooth keyboard for debugging, the only key events that seem to make it through correctly are the arrow keys. Everything else comes in as \"Dead\".\r\n\r\nNote: http://jsfiddle.net/5r0enc79/17 Using this fiddle, all key events appear to be correct on the same iPad.\r\n\r\nVersion of React: 16.4\r\niPad: 11.3 (15E216)\r\nBrowser: Safari\r\n",
