  "body": "As someone unfamiliar with React's Synthetic Event system, it took me a lot of time to find the list of possible values for the `key` prop in keyboard events. I was expecting a numeric value since I vaguely remembered the [`keyCode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode) prop, but that's apparently deprecated now.\r\n\r\nAfter several minutes of searching, I found a link in the [React v0.11 release blog post](https://reactjs.org/blog/2014/07/17/react-v0.11.html#improved-keyboard-event-normalization), so I thought this definitely should be in the docs :smile:\r\n\r\nLet me know if you'd like the language changed or anything like that. I've completed the CLA as well :slightly_smiling_face: \r\n",
