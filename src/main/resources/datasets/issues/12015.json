  "body": "There seems to be bug in React, when child node has textNode it does not render correct output.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce (JSFiddle):\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/vs6cbqdb/\r\n\r\nExpected output is:\r\nHello 12\r\nHello 21\r\nHello 12\r\nBut React rendered:\r\nHello 21\r\nHello 12\r\nHello 21\r\n\r\nrendered output is not matching console log, however when textNode is removed its working as expected. See this fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/4yk06xgp/\r\n12\r\n21\r\n12\r\nAdding text node \"Hello\" before numbers causes unexpected output.\r\n\r\nTested only in React 16.2.0\r\n",
