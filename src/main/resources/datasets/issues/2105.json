  "body": "This is a bug that's difficult to describe - I'm noticing that the Perf tool is incorrectly reporting wasted time even though the DOM did change.\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. Visit http://fiddle.jshell.net/tfKYJ/58/show/light/\n2. Make sure you're focused on the page\n3. Press `K` to start Perf recording\n4. Click on gray area\n5. Press `K` to stop Perf recording\n\nOnly up the Javascript Console, and you'll notice that \"wasted time\" was reported, even though no time should've been wasted.\n\nIf you continue to play around, you'll notice inconsistencies. You may have to click several times during recording to get \"wasted\" time.\n\n(original fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/tfKYJ/58/)\n",
