  "body": "Should we let people invoke `setState` in `componentWillUnmount`? It seems harmless, but currently we throw. In theory, `this.state` should be cleared out when unmounting (but we do not for backward compatibility reasons).\n\nAside, as we get better at clearing asynchronous callbacks on unmount, we should seriously consider clearing `this.state` and `this.props` when unmounting.\n",
