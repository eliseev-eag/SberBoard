  "body": "Hello. Since upgrading to v15 I get this all over the place in my unit tests:\n\n`Warning: It looks like you're using a minified copy of the development build of React. When deploying React apps to production, make sure to use the production build which skips development warnings and is faster. See https://fb.me/react-minification for more details.`\n\nThis warning makes sense in prod but in my case, my toolchain is a little different; I use React with Scala and build a special `test-deps.js` containing all external JS required by unit tests. Minimising it means it loads faster and so I end up with a valid case for a minimisation of the React dev.\n\nIs there a way to remove this warning? It appears a heap of times as my tests are concurrent.\n",
