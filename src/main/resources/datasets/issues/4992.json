  "body": "I'm doing scroll animations with react components. I found that having `scrollPosition` as a state and passing it down via props is terribly slow. `shouldComponentUpdate` won't help, because `scrollPosition` will change at 60fps. Instead I'm using refs to let the new scroll position trickle down via `this.refs[key].handleScrollChange(scrollPosition)`. This works very well, but has one big downside: it's not declarative anymore and I need to keep things in sync manually. Bummer!\n\nI'm opening this issue to discuss ways which could drastically improve `style` animations in react and could also benefit modules such as react-motion. I basically know nothing about the internals of react, but from a api-user perspective I'd imagine the following: allow (per-component) to opt into a separation of react elements and the `style` property.\n1. The new react element (maybe sth. like style-less or plain, we'll find a name) does not allow `style` and warns in debug mode\n2. There's a new `Style` component which is similar to a component. It accepts props (and maybe has state?) and has a `shouldComponentUpdate`. It also requires a parent component. The `render` method returns a plain object (the style as key/value). When re-rendering the style is diffed with the previous and the changes are applied to the parent's component's node style.\n3. The `Style` component can be updated independent from its parent (this gives the performance boost).\n4. We can now move the fast-changing props like `scrollPosition` away from the actual component into the style-component and boom.\n\nThese are just some thoughts from the top of my end. Here's a very simple demo to make a point: https://github.com/Prinzhorn/react-setstate-callstack-of-death (http://prinzhorn.github.io/react-setstate-callstack-of-death/)\n\nHere's a screenshot of what it looks like when I toggle between `setState` based animation and the refs based approach (with 100 animated items)\n\n![screenshot from 2015-09-28 13 36 56](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/679144/10134807/ea742280-65e8-11e5-8e43-759997417f78.png)\n\nI believe that separating the `style` property from the rest will result in similar performance gains while still being declarative (with a single source of truth) and allowing clean separation.\n",
