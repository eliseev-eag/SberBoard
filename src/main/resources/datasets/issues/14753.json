  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nbug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nwith nested components, `componentDidMount` is called first for parent and then for its children.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nthe parent's `componentDidMount` should be called after children's are mounted, otherwise it's impossible to e.g. calculate the parent node's height because it's still empty when `componentDidMount` is fired\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nwe have an old app which used to use react 15.6.2 and that we recently update to react 16.7.0. in this app we have a list of items which can be collapsed or expanded when clicking on a button. since the update to react 16.7.0 this feature is broken because the parent height calculation is done on an empty `<div>`\r\n\r\nthe markup is simple:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  <div ref={this.getNode}>\r\n    {this.props.children}\r\n </div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen calling `componentDidMount` the `<div>` is mounted but empty, because the children have not been mounted yet, so the `<div>` height is zero. react's documentation also states \"It can, however, be necessary for cases like modals and tooltips when you need to measure a DOM node before rendering something that depends on its size or position\", but this is obviously impossible to do correctly if the DOM is only partially rendered...\r\n\r\n",
