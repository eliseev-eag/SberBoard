Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nI did a example project (https://codesandbox.io/s/910pqpn23r?module=%2Fsrc%2FTableRow.js)\r\n\r\nAfter you run, you need only to click the button to see the error.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nUnmount the component correctly\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nTested React version: 16.6.3 and i don't know if this already worked on any previous versions.",
