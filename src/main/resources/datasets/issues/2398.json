  "body": "...or warn?\n\nIt's best practice to defer `React.render` until the container node is actually in the document. That allows `componentDidMount/Update` events work as expected through out the system.\n\nWe could use a in-document detection to determine if a container in the document. If not, we could either warn or use a hack to defer rendering until it actually gets added to the document.\n\nWeb components have similar life-cycle hooks. Integrating with them would likely involve deferring all work until we're in the document.\n",
