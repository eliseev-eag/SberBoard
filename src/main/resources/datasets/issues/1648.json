  "body": "Add the ability to define virtual attributes for HTML elements in `React.DOM`. This would allow semantic attributes to be declared that would be applied to modify some other attributes on the element. They could be declared in such a way:\n\n``` javascript\n/**\n * The callback would be given access to the attribute's value,\n * and allow it to modify the other attributes of the element.\n */\nfunction hiddenAttribute (value, attributes) {\n  if (value) {\n    attributes.style || (attributes.style = {});\n    attributes.style.display = 'none';\n  }\n}\n\nReact.declareAttribute('hidden', hiddenAttribute);\n```\n\nUsing it in JSX:\n\n``` javascript\n/**\n * @jsx React.DOM\n * @jsxns {\"Core\":\"Core\",\"Common\":\"Common\"}\n */\n\nvar MyComponent = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    return <div hidden={true}>...</div>;\n  }\n});\n```\n\nOutputs:\n\n``` html\n<div style=\"display: none;\">...</div>\n```\n\nThis would only be for `React.DOM` elements, not custom components. However, if one were to use `transferPropsTo` on a `React.DOM` element, then it would inherit the hidden attribute.\n\nWhile writing this up, I haven't been able to think of any other useful attributes, so perhaps it's not as useful if there's only the single use case.\n\nIf there's buy-in for a concept like this, I'd be happy to attempt an implementation of it. Just thought I'd propose to see if it would be beneficial to anyone else for a different kind of attribute.\n",
