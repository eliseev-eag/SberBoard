This works well on smaller sites, or in a situation where your company may have a monorepo and can enforce and track these warnings.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIn addition to this behavior, it would be beneficial to React developers if they could have ESLint plugins that had rules for these warnings. Ideally, the ESLint plugin could fix simple cases (methods being renamed) and in more complex cases recommend a codemod.\r\n\r\n——-\r\n\r\nI’m posting this here as per discussion with @acdlite on twitter. See this thread: https://twitter.com/acdlite/status/1178018850937290753?s=21\r\n\r\nUltimately, it is harder for shops that do micro frontends to ensure everyone is compliant with new React versions. It is also easier to catch things early at build time then to dig around in the browser runtime when there may be other compounding issues.\r\n\r\nThe other benefit of this would be that it would enable third party libraries to potentially have “day 1 support” for new major React versions because they could follow the rule set and ensure that they are forwards compatible without being caught trying to do it all at once.\r\n\r\nLastly, I’m happy to help drive/contribute to any rule set to make sure it works in our use case.\r\n",
