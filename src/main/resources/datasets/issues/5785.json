  "body": "The `onSelect` event does not fire while the user is dragging the mouse, only after they release. It would be nice to have an event that fired immediately whenever the selection changed, including while dragging the mouse. This is useful, for example, when syncing selections between multiple collaborators, ala google docs.\n\nThe native [selectionchange](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/selectionchange) event is supported cross browser, way back in IE, Chrome, and Safari, and recently in Firefox 43. Is this something React could polyfill and expose to components?\n",
