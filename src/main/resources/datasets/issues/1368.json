  "body": "When using `<ReactCSSTransitionGroup>` on a component, the special lifecycle hooks are not being called.\n\nI think it would be useful and nice to know when a transition occurs and which state the transition owns.\n\nI guess `ComponentWillEnter`, `ComponentDidEnter` and other special methods were meant to expose those states, but I cannot make it work, unless I use `<ReactTransitionGroup>`, but this way css classes are not being applied during the transition.\n\nDocumentation here (http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html) states:  \n\n\"ReactTransitionGroup is the basis for animations. When children are declaratively added or removed from it (as in the example above) special lifecycle hooks are called on them.\"\n\n\"The example above\" is using `<ReactCSSTransitionGroup>`, so one would expect to have those special hooks being called, but it seems they don't.\n",
