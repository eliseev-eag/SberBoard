  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nFeature\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\nYou need to specify a unique key\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\nN/A\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nIt should behave the same as using a unique key string\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\nN/A\n\n---\n\nThe idea came when I was discussing [a module I wrote](https://github.com/kolodny/weak-key) to take care of this functionality. I can't really think of a reason why this behavior shouldn't work out of the box.\n\nIn a regular setting, people need to either add an id property to objects in an array to spend a non-zero cogintive load figuring out which field or fields will be unique in the set. There's no reason  why just passing an object shouldn't work.\n\nIn a case where the collection is refetched and therefore all the previous references are lost, the elements in the array will tend to be in the same order, and therefore should not cause any perf hit (I don't know enough to comment on the perf hit for an insert or removal in the middle of the collection). SSR should have a similar perf hit (which is to say none), although the `key` prop will need to be stripped out of the server rendered markup.\n\nIs this something worth pursuing?\n",
