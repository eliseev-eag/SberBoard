  "body": "React is an amazing library, literally changed the way I get to develop applications at my job and made a more pleasant experience day to day. However I absolutely hate how so many legacy things affect react. The way react is built is terrible and from issues I've seen it seems to be some \"legacy build system\" monstrosity that could never be fixed because of internal Facebook reliance on these things. A major part of the community suffers from this in more than one way:\r\n1. React is extremely large despite react clones like Preact and Inferno (the most popular alternatives)\r\n2. React distributed size is well large in comparison to vue and angular\r\n3. React Cannot be compiled through Googles Closure Compiler\r\n\r\nA start to this change could be switching to more modern build system like Webpack and Rollup create smaller library output (Particularly Rollup) and smaller bundles for people who use React in their web applications \r\n\r\nAs much as people would love to contribute to change the way react is built someone not familiar to how react current build system is tightly coupled with Facebooks usage will not be able to get a PR successfully merged. I'm hoping that with the rewrite and release of React Fiber this can be fixed and with the new found Performance movement going on in the Javascript community The team at Facebook behind react will accept this call to action and make a change for the better and for all those reliant on react. If not, well, were shit out of luck.",
