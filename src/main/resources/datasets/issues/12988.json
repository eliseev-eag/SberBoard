  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nA bug\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nFor some reason just IE 11 is raising an exception and pointing to this:\r\n```\r\nReactBatch.prototype._onComplete = function() {\r\n  if (this._didComplete) {\r\n            return;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  this._didComplete = true;\r\n  const callbacks = this._callbacks;\r\n  if (callbacks === null) {\r\n    return;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // TODO: Error handling.\r\n  for (let i = 0; i < callbacks.length; i++) {\r\n    const callback = callbacks[i];\r\n    callback();\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nMy guess is that it wouldn't throw an exception if the callback call is handled.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nNot sure, started seeing it in the last month and a half or more.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, the exception just pops up randomly. I can see that it happens on a project a lot lately from the logs. Ill make a fork, this seems very easy to handle, posting for visibility, any insight of what this code actually does and why it would break on ie 11 is welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks",
