  "body": "When you create an input component and set its `value` without providing an `onChange` handler, React will log this to the console:\n\n> \"You provided a `value` prop to a form field without an `onChange` handler. This will render a read-only field. If the field should be mutable use `defaultValue`. Otherwise, set either `onChange` or `readOnly`. \"\n\nThis isn't entirely accurate however. For example in my app I rely on event bubbling so that I can set a single `onChange` on the form component, thereby ~~saving my sanity~~ preventing me from having to add an `onChange` to every. single. field. (There are a lot in the app I'm working on)\n",
