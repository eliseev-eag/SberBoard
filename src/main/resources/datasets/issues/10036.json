  "body": "This is a small follow-on to the addition of ReactDOMNodeStream, allowing users of the API to specify how much memory the stream should use to buffer. \r\n\r\nAs explained in the [Node stream buffering documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_buffering), users of Readable streams can pass in a `highWaterMark` which indicates how many bytes the stream should buffer before pausing the stream. This allows users of the stream to tune how much memory they use, depending on their particular use case. `highWaterMark` defaults to 16K but can be set to any number.\r\n\r\nThe code part of this is pretty simple; `renderToStream` and `renderToStaticStream` now just take in an optional options object with a `highWaterMark` property, and that value is passed along to the `Readable` constructor. All the code for that is in `ReactDOMNodeStreamRenderer.js`. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the PR is documentation and a few simple tests to make sure `highWaterMark` is being used.",
