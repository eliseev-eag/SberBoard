  "body": "I'm  slowly working on making sure no code at FB depends on modules internal to React. Mostly that involves changing code to use public APIs but there are also several things that are in React which are more general purpose and should be moved out to `fbjs`. The example I'm hitting right now is `isEventSupported`, used by `normalizeWheel`, used by `ReactWheelHandler`, used by a couple modules in Fixed Data Table. I know `adler32` is also used elsewhere, as are some of the transition event detection, and there are surely others.\n\nMostly this is a reminder to myself to do this and a notice of sorts to others that random files will disappear from the repo and will live in fbjs instead.\n- [ ] `isEventSupported`\n- [ ] `adler32`\n",
