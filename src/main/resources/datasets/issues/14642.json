Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.:**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/1yom049zkj\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nAttaching ref successfully\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
