  "body": "https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/07/03/react-v0.14-beta-1.html\n\n> The other big change we're making in this release is exposing refs to DOM components as the DOM node itself. That means: we looked at what you can do with a ref to a DOM component and realized that the only useful thing you can do with it is call this.refs.giraffe.getDOMNode() to get the underlying DOM node.\n\nIâ€™ve used `refs` to perform a custom method such as `play()` on a child component. Having only the DOM node accessible will make this no longer possible.\n\nIs there a better practice I should be following to call methods on descendent components?\n",
