  "body": "Since mixins are no longer a part of the future React API plan, and the [current React.createMixin implementation](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/isomorphic/React.js#L78-L81) is just a no-op, I think we can consider removing it.\r\n\r\nSince it was part of the public API I believe it would need to happen in the next major release. Should we add a deprecation warning before then? There are [a number of projects](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%22React.createMixin%22&type=Code&ref=searchresults) that use the API.\r\n\r\ncc @spicyj @gaearon ",
