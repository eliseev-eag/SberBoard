  "body": "The `unstable_handleError` feature #2461 , which allows for error boundaries in components, will attempt to re-render the component after the first error is handled in the boundary defined in `unstable_handleError`.\r\n\r\nOn this second render, by design, if an unhandled error occurs in the render, the error bubbles up to the parent:\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/3bc5595dfd6db741b19f17e7aef98b2c1e4be847/src/renderers/shared/stack/reconciler/ReactCompositeComponent.js#L483\r\n\r\nIt would be better if we can configure this behavior - to be able to choose to have it bubble up, or be handled by the `unstable_handleError` upon retry.\r\n\r\nIn our case, it is acceptable to continue to retry over and over to render the screen and have a few errors, as there is the occasional race condition where the current state is not ready yet for the current component being rendered. It can error a few times until the state is ready.",
