  "body": "The number is the reactTag which is found in product code with `findNodeHandle`. In order to get rid of `findNodeHandle` this needs to be able to be called with a ref. This PR now allows measureLayout to be passed a ref which must be a ref to a native node. \r\n\r\nIn Paper we will get the nativeTag for this ref, in Fabric, in a follow up, this will pull the node off the ref.canonical and call FabricUIManger with it.",
