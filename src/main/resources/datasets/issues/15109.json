  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nbug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIf you render two SVG elements that have a `stop` element with a `stopColor` property that is passed in from props, it uses the same color for both elements even though they are different.\r\n\r\nExample: https://codesandbox.io/s/qookw7v34\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThere should be a black and a white SVG element. The `stopColor` should reflect whatever prop I passed in.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.8.4 (tested in Firefox and Chrome)\r\n",
