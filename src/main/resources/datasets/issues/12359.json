  "body": "Implements the new context API on top of the existing ReactStack that we already use for host context and legacy context. Now there is a single array that we push and pop from.\r\n\r\nThis makes the interrupt path slightly slower, since when we reset the unit of work pointer, we have to iterate over the stack (like before) *and* switch on the type of work (not like before). On the other hand, this unifies all of the unwinding behavior in the UnwindWork module.\r\n\r\nAlso changes the context modules to use module constructors, so that each renderer gets a separate instance, which is currently broken when using react-reconciler.\r\n\r\nThis is not a total unification of legacy context and the new context API. A further step would be to implement the legacy, `contextTypes`-based API on top of `React.createContext`.",
