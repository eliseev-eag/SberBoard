  "body": "`ReactEmptyComponent` registers null component IDs on mount and deregisters them on unmount. However, when rendering server-side `unmountComponent` is never called on the component instance. As a result, null IDs accumulate over time.\n\nThe solution in the PR is simply to not register the IDs when server-side rendering. I have no idea if that's the right solution, but it's certainly _a_ solution!\n\nI'm also not sure if this is still an issue in 0.15. The issue was found in 0.14.7. You can see in this heapdump a ton of React ID strings, each one being retained by `nullComponentIDsRegistry`:\n\n<img width=\"940\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-02-17 at 5 11 16 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/135977/13130574/e50e0d94-d599-11e5-80cf-d83b1b586296.png\">\n",
