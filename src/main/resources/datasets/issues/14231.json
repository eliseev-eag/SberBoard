It appears the value is read before the object is created now and thinks no context is being used.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16.6.3, tested 16.3 too (could not test 16.2 due to other dep depending on new context API)",
