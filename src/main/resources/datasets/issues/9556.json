  "body": "Most Map and Set polyfills work by adding a hidden field to the key. We don't want to do this for fibers because it causes a de-opt. Because the only case where we use fibers as keys is to keep track of failed error boundaries, and the number of failed error boundaries is usually low, we can use arrays instead.",
