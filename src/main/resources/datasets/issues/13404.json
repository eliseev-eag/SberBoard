  "body": "This is the more targeted of two possible approaches to resolve #13400, the other being @gaearon's [suggestion](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13400#issuecomment-413048688) of warning on _any_ string value passed to a boolean prop (also subsuming #13372).\r\n\r\nApart from my [other reservation](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13400#issuecomment-413056690) regarding a blanket warning on string values, the present approach has the advantage of being applicable to `BOOLEAN`, `BOOLEANISH_STRING` _and_ `OVERLOADED_BOOLEAN` props (see [`DOMProperty.js`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-dom/src/shared/DOMProperty.js) for definitions). The latter do legitimately need to accept arbitrary string values alongside booleans; if we did go with a blanket warning, it would only make sense for the first two types, so we'd potentially still want a separate check for `\"\"` to accommodate `OVERLOADED_BOOLEAN`.\r\n\r\nThe one wrinkle here (that would also affect the other approach) is that I had to special-case `value` and exclude it from the warning, since it's somewhat oddly modelled as a `BOOLEANISH_STRING`, making legitimate uses of `value=\"\"` warn under my initial implementation. This raises a separate question, though: when is `value` ever legitimately a _boolean_? (`<param>`? That's a bit tenuous; `value` is certainly not [specced](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/iframe-embed-object.html#attr-param-value) as a boolean there.) However, we can't just remove it from the whitelist, as that would break current behaviour.",
