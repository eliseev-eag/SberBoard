  "body": "My favorite devtools feature, \"Why did this render?\", has a remaining problem: it's too hard to flip through a long list of renders in the Rendered At list to find an interesting render. I know I can use the mouse (or Tab and then Space) to move to the next render, but that's painful if there are 50+ renders to work through.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: when an item in the Rendered At list has focus, then up/down arrows should change the selected render (and scroll the pane up/down if the selected render isn't visible). \r\n\r\nThis would be helpful for accessibility too.\r\n\r\nI'll file a separate issue for keyboard support for the flamegraph view. Keyboard access to that view will be much harder to implement so it makes sense to do it separately.\r\n\r\n---\r\nOriginally reported by @justingrant via https://github.com/bvaughn/react-devtools-experimental/issues/332",
