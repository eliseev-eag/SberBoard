  "body": "Hey there,\n\nI'm trying to use `React.Children.map` in conjunction with `React.addons.cloneWithProps` to create a copy of my children. However, it's [surprising behavior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) to find that map does not return an array as a typical map function would. \n\nThe value I see in returning an array would be enabling one to perform array operations on a collection of children, such as reordering/splicing, inserting new elements, etc. Since it doesn't return an array, and the children are meant to be an opaque data structure, it's unclear to me what the best practice is for doing this type of thing.\n\nI've created a [rough jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/uhe5tgoh/1/) that demonstrates this. \n\nI assume this behavior is for optimization purposes, in which case maybe there is some other way to think about my problem. \n\nThanks for any feedback! Cheers.\n",
