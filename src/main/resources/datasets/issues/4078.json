  "body": "After many hours of contortions, I've been able to get React components under test in a headless nodejs + mocha environment using Domino JS as a fake DOM implementation. We have about 550 component tests that run in about 30 seconds (the first time).\n\nUnfortunately, using the `mocha --watch` command leaks a large number of Elements (~13k) and about 120MB of memory with each test run. After digging through heap dumps, I've found the elements hiding in the [nodeCache](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/client/ReactMount.js#L40) variable in the ReactMount file.\n\nWe are definitely calling `unmountComponentAtNode(component, elementContext)` for every outer component that we render with `renderComponent` and receiving a boolean `true` response.\n\nI added a `purgeAll()` method to my local build that simply resets this cache and this cut about 100MB of the memory loss. There are a number of other global caches hiding in a handful of other modules (include ReactMount). The proposal is that all of these should be reset from some global utility method like:\n\n``` javascript\nReact.addons.TestUtils.purgeCaches();\n```\n\nIf this seems like a change that would be approved, I'd be happy to put together a pull request.\n\n**[Update 6/11/2015]**\n\nFor server side rendering environments, it might be better for this to exist in the real API, not TestUtils.\n\n``` javascript\nReact.purgeCaches();\n```\n",
