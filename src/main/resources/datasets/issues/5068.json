  "body": "I've found obscure problem with re-rendering tbody with smaller amount of children, here is minimal example: https://jsfiddle.net/5xhxfb7g/\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. Select 5 rows, press Apply - you will get table with 5 rows\n2. Select lesser amount of rows, press Apply - you will get\n`Invariant Violation: processUpdates(): Unable to find child 5 of element. This probably means the DOM was unexpectedly mutated (e.g., by the browser), usually due to forgetting a <tbody> when using tables, nesting tags like <form>, <p>, or <a>, or using non-SVG elements in an <svg> parent. Try inspecting the child nodes of the element with React ID `.0.3.0`.`\n\nThe fix is to remove spaces in Table render (line 36), from\n `<tbody> {rows} </tbody>`\nto\n`<tbody>{rows}</tbody>`\n\nI'm not sure if this is a real bug, but it woul'd be nice to have this mentioned in error message.\n",
