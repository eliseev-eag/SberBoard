  "body": "In version 58, Chrome shipped support for the [HTMLMediaElement ControlList API](https://github.com/WICG/controls-list/blob/gh-pages/explainer.md) and, by extension, the controlList attribute on elements like `video` and `audio`.  [Here's how the attribute looks in practice.](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/03/chrome-58-media-updates#controlslist)\r\n\r\nReact <= 15.5.4 does not support this attribute and strips it out with a `Warning: Unknown prop controlsList on <video> tag. Remove this prop from the element.` warning in the console.\r\n\r\nCould you add support for this new attribute? This isn't a pressing issue as it's possible to set the attribute via javascript (i.e. by setting it in a `ref` or in a component lifecycle event), but it would be nice to have it recognized as the valid attribute it is.",
