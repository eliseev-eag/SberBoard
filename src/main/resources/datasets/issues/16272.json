  "body": "Why is the value of the `key`-attribute unavailable in `props`?\r\n\r\nI'm experimenting with state management abstractions, and I wanted to make `key` required and use the value as the key to a state container - something along the lines of this:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Provider store={store} key=\"count\">\r\n    {count => <h1>Count: {count}</h1>}\r\n</Provider>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would be meaningful, because the `Provider` instance can't actually be reused if the key to the store changes, at least not without adding extra complexity.\r\n\r\nCurrently, my only recourse is to duplicate this value with a different name:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Provider store={store} key=\"count\" storeKey=\"count\">\r\n    {count => <h1>Count: {count}</h1>}\r\n</Provider>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is rather inelegant and errorprone.\r\n\r\n`key` is a prop, so I'd expect it to exist in `props`.\r\n\r\nWhy this seemingly arbitrary restriction?\r\n",
