  "body": "`input` is simple enough, it's a bit verbose but there's nothing wrong with `this.getDOMNode().value`.\n\n`select` also has `value`, but it's not supported on IE8 at the very least. Meaning, uncontrolled `select` is not fun at all to work with. If you use `multiple` on top of that, it becomes even worse as `value` seizes to be useful, the nice arrays in React no longer work.\n\nConsidering that it should be very little actual code, is it perhaps an idea to consider having `.getValue()`, `.setValue()`, `.focus()`, etc helpers on inputs? It would make reasonable common use-cases a lot less low-level to work with, at the cost of just a few bytes.\n",
