  "body": "Scheduler needs to schedule a task that fires after paint. To do this, it currently posts a message event to `window`. This happens on every frame until the queue is empty. An unfortunate consequence is that every other message event handler also gets called on every frame; even if they exit immediately, this adds up to significant per-frame overhead.\r\n\r\nInstead, we'll create a MessageChannel and post to that, with a fallback to the old behavior if MessageChannel does not exist.",
