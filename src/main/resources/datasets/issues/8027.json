I think this is the last stuff we need before merging new-docs to master.\n- Adds redirects for all the broken links (that I could find manually)\n- Rename the tutorial so only one thing is called \"Thinking In React\"\n- Made sure prev/next links are correct for the quickstart\n- Fix left nav spacing\n- Get rid of all the unused stuff marked \"old\" like yml config template etc\n- Make sure the error decoder still works\n",
