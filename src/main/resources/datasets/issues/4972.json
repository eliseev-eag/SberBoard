  "body": "I originally left a comment in #4936, but I felt this might be better as a separate issue.\n\n> I completely agree with the rationale behind no backing instances and no refs for stateless components. I want to use pure stateless components as much as possible.\n> \n> However, I'm running into instances where testing stateless components gets tricky. For the most part, using the shallow renderer to render a stateless component has been fine. I can then make assertions on expected props and children. To reduce the duplication, I abstract out the shallow renderer process to a helper function.\n> \n> When, I want to test events, though, I have to take a different route. If my component takes an `onClick` prop, then I wrap it in a class component, so I can access the DOM node to simulate my click event. Again, this isn't a huge deal because I can abstract out the wrap/render process into a helper function.\n> \n> I bring all this up because I feel that it would be nice to have better facilities in `TestUtils` for stateless components. I don't think the answer is allowing `ReactDOM.findDOMNode` to work on stateless components because that opens up it to abuse in normal application code. Are you open to allowing extra functions in `TestUtils` to simplify the process of testing stateless components? Or am I creating a code smell in my testing?\n> \n> I'd be happy to create a PR for `TestUtils` if you think some more helper functions for stateless components would be beneficial.\n",
