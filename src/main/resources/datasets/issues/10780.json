  "body": "I have a question for everyone.\r\nI did a test with react + react-dom and preact + preact-compat using the same js file to generate a bundle using different frameworks. but the output of the react bundle with react-dom is very large, about 224kb. while the preact is 30.7kb, I find that a lot of difference. I do not know if there is any light version of react-dom or I need to do some optimization in the webpack. because it is a very big difference.\r\n\r\nHas anyone seen this and talked about it?\r\n\r\noutput using Preact:\r\n![preact](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5420816/30747055-5e4e1326-9f82-11e7-8b10-586a08e0e1fb.png)\r\n\r\nSame project using React:\r\n![react](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5420816/30747063-6685dd76-9f82-11e7-8e94-1c51a4358a94.png)\r\n\r\nthank you",
