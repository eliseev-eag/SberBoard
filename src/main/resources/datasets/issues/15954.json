It's used for helping with onChange events picked up by the ChangeEventPlugin and the SelectEventPlugin. It was at one point part of the ChangeEvent code before being abstracted out in 2013.\r\n\r\nIf I comment out all but three type checks in this file, The tests all still pass.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst supportedInputTypes: {[key: string]: true | void} = {\r\n  // color: true,\r\n  // date: true,\r\n  // datetime: true,\r\n  // 'datetime-local': true,\r\n  // email: true,\r\n  // month: true,\r\n  number: true,\r\n  // password: true,\r\n  range: true,\r\n  // search: true,\r\n  // tel: true,\r\n  text: true,\r\n  // time: true,\r\n  // url: true,\r\n  week: undefined, // changed from true; same behavior as commenting out the line\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nTests should fail if any of the above branching logic switches from false to true or true to false.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI'm branching off master at `commit 5368f7316c8ae489c6a271694166158428ee4a5e`\r\nThis behavior is code-specific so It should be platform agnostic.",
