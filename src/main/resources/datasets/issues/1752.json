  "body": "Hi,\n\nI want a component to have at least one required children.\nAs children can be both a singe element or an array it is not easy (to avoid useless array allocation according to the doc).\n\nI don't know which is the simplest way to do so but come up with this syntax:\n\n```\n        children: React.PropTypes.oneOfType([\n            React.PropTypes.component,\n            React.PropTypes.arrayOf(React.PropTypes.component)\n        ]),\n```\n\nI guess my usecase can be quite common for people building Modals and things like that.\nMaybe it would be nice to have a simpler way to express the children is required?\n\nMaybe `React.PropTypes.any.isRequired` will do the same job? Is there some kind of guarantee that the children prop will never be a different type than `component` or `array(component)` ?\n",
