  "body": "Fixes the 16.2 regression in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11692.\r\n\r\nRestores the behavior from 16.0 and 16.1 but with a better message.\r\nAlso adds a catch-all to prevent future regressions.\r\n\r\nI thought we could skip them. But then adding support for them later would be a breaking change. Seems better to be strict now, so we aren't blocked on a major release for supporting them in the future.",
