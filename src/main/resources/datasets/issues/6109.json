  "body": "- Fixes the position left-hand nav when scrolling\n- Persists the scroll position of the navigation when clicking through the pages (10 second timeout) using localStorage.\n- Uses the \"sticky footer\" technique on the main footer, so the footer doesn't clash with shorter pages. \n## Rationale\n- Easier to access the navigation when scrolled on a long page\n- Easier to traverse between Docs pages within a given category\n## Notable changes\n- `.nav-docs` is now position: fixed \n- Added a new `main` div which wrap the site contents, except for the footer (for sticky footer)\n- Added a new `fixed-nav.js` file and included in the `<head />` \n## Notes\n- I think this might have been an intention early on for the site, as `position: fixed` is [commented-out](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/docs/css/react.scss#L232). Not sure why it never made it into the initial release of the site, but this implementation is more than just CSS.\n- Tested in latest FF, Safari, Chrome, Edge and IE11.\n- **Question**: I noticed there's a `javascript.js` inside of the ignored `js` folder, but can't find where this is built from? Was thinking I could use that file instead of creating `fixed-nav.js`\n\n![bk6j0nlxaw](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24449/13291697/a366ac1c-db10-11e5-8c06-8f29ec15054d.gif)\n",
