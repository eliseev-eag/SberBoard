Also kinda just going with the flow where this seems to be the place to raise generic \"issues\" even if they're not bugs :)\r\n\r\n1. keys can make things slower\r\n\r\nI had a bunch of items, and the only thing that changed was their x/y positions. adding a key with index made rendering slower. It's possible this is short-sighted though since it could very well change once that \"layer\" has more items changing above/below it, but I found it interesting.\r\n\r\n2. rendering null makes a _huge_ difference\r\n\r\nI had two test cases - a full graphics pipeline vs. an essentially empty POJO renderer. The difference in speed didn't matter about the data or graphics, but rather about what was returned in the components `render()`. For DOM this doesn't work of course - but for custom renderers, when it's known that a certain type of element will be an edge node - doing the side effects in render() (or some other lifecycle) and then returning `null` is _significantly_ faster than even a straight functional component that returns a simple element (which does the same side effects). This makes sense, since react then has less branches to consider (even if those branches point to nothing other than simple objects).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
