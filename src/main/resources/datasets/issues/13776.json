(That is, one that is showing a fallback and waiting for the suspended content to resolve.)\r\n\r\nThe logic I'm leaving untouched with `nextRenderIncludesTimedOutPlaceholder` is *not* correct -- what we want is instead to know if *any* placeholder anywhere in the tree is showing its fallback -- but we don't currently have a better replacement, and this should unblock tracing with suspense again.\r\n",
