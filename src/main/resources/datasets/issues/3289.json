  "body": "I've noticed that there's no way to access a class' statics through one of its instances.\nWhen trying to find a `statics` method inside an instance method, `this` does not contain the method. `this.statics` exists, but is `null`.\n\nThis is something I think could be a bit useful. This is a behavior that exists in Java and other similar languages.\n\nA description of my use-case: I am using [React DnD](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd), and trying to slightly generalize duplicate code.\nBy using this library/mixin, you need to define a static method, which calls a `register` method and passes a constant value. I would like that value to be defined on the class.\n\nBy adding the following bit of code:\n\n``` js\nstatics: {\n  getConst: function() {\n    return 'const';\n  },\n  configureDragDrop: function(register) {\n    register(this.getConst(), ...);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, in my `render` method, I need to access the same constant again:\n\n``` jsx\nreturn (\n  <li className={classes} {...this.dragSourceFor('const')} />\n);\n```\n\nAt this point, `this` does not have `getConst` defined, and `this.statics` is a null object.\n",
