However, we should still warn in DEV because that can end up pretty bad.\r\n\r\nThis starts adding warnings for those cases. I still have several steps left but this can ideally be landed at any midway point if someone wants to review it.\r\n\r\n- [x] Warn for differences in text content.\r\n- [x] Warn for known props that have different values.\r\n- [x] Warn for extra attributes that are not known.\r\n- [x] Warn for dangerouslySetInnerHTML differences.\r\n- [x] Warn for extra nodes that will be deleted.\r\n- [x] Warn for missing nodes that will have a new node inserted.\r\n\r\nLeft this for a follow up PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] Warn for inline styles that have different values. #10084\r\n- [x] Add more test coverage for individual attribute mismatches, insert/delete, style mismatches, single child text content mismatches. #10084\r\n- [ ] Consolidate multiple warnings into a single warn (ideally with a HTML diff like format) instead of just warning for one difference at a time. #10085\r\n",
