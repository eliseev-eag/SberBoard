  "body": "I need rich information with full filenames for Create React App so I can show component stack prominently and map it back to source snippets.\r\n\r\nIdeally I want it for all warnings, but the \"invalid type\" is the most common and useful one, and I'd like to start with it. I'm sending this against 15.6 because I want to get it in soon, and start iterating on this idea. Maybe we'll drop it in 16, or maybe not. I want to play with it for a while. If it works well I’ll send another PR against master later to do this in a more generic way.\r\n\r\nThe stack object format is `Array<{fileName: string | null, lineNumber: number | null, functionName: string | null}>`. `console.stack()` and `console.stackEnd()` does not really exist, but we’ll define it in CRA environment, and possibly in RN in the future. If it works well we can look at proposing a standard since it can be useful for other use cases too.",
