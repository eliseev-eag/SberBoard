Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/1utpfn5s/6/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI expect that the order of props supplied to `<progress />` are irrelevant. In the example above, the initial value of the rendered `<progress />` should be `50`.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nAt least IE11 and Edge (40) are affected. Chrome and Firefox work fine.\r\n",
