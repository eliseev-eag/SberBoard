  "body": "Here is a classic example of creating a React class in es6:\n\n``` js\nexport class Counter extends React.Component {\n  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps, nextContext) {\n     ...\n  }\n\n  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState, nextContext) { \n     ...\n  }\n  render() {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThere are a few things I find bothersome with the lifecycle method names:\n# Problem\n## Including 'component' in the method name is redundant\n\nSince we are extending a class, Liskov substitution tells us that we the subclass we are implementing should implement the behaviors of `Component`. Since we know our class is a Component, saying `componentWillReceiveProps` is redundant, we could just as well say `willReceiveProps`.\n\nThis redundancy may seem trivial, but it is more typing, more boilerplate, and thus, more error-prone.\n## The name is non-orthogonal\n1. `componentWillMount`\n2. `componentDidMount`\n3. `componentWillReceiveProps`\n4. `shouldComponentUpdate` <- :confused:\n5. `componentWillUpdate`\n6. `componentDidUpdate`\n7. `componentWillUnmount`\n\nI end up typing `componentShouldUpdate` more often than I would like to admit. At best, this is a distraction, at worst, it is a subtle source of bugs. \n# Proposed Solution\n\nAdd alias methods fore the lifecycle methods\n1. `componentWillMount`             ----> `willMount`\n2. `componentDidMount`             ----> `didMount`\n3. `componentWillReceiveProps` ----> `willReceiveProps`\n4. `shouldComponentUpdate`      ----> `shouldUpdate`\n5. `componentWillUpdate`             ----> `willUpdate`\n6. `componentDidUpdate`            ----> `didUpdate`\n7. `componentWillUnmount`          ----> `willUnmount`\n\nNow, this will obviously require a deprecation cycle as we need to warn users that are using these method names for other reasons. It seems to be somewhat common (a quick search on Github shows many people doing this).\n## Conclusion\n\nAlthough this may seem like bike-shedding, I think this is important and will save time/agony for the long future of React users (old and new).\n\n:heart: \n",
