  "body": "I think I've come across a bug with TransitionGroup which basically causes properties of the \"leave\" styles to be ignored. [Here](http://jsfiddle.net/matthewwithanm/GqhtQ/)'s a fiddle demonstrating the problem.\n\nAs you can see, the \"leave\" animation doesn't use the correct origin or transition (in the latest Chrome or FF). If those properties are moved to an always-matching selector (\".bluebox\"), it works fine.\n\nMy only guess as to why this would happen is that the active leave class is being added in the same tick as the leave.\n",
