  "body": "Since we already depend on `Map` and `Set` I figured we might as well ask users to polyfill `Object.assign` if they need to.\r\n\r\nIn browsers, it's still not supported everywhere (e.g. IE 11 doesn’t but Edge does). There is a precedent: Relay Modern, Preact, Inferno don’t ship with it. Many Redux apps use `Object.assign` so users resort to polyfilling it anyway.\r\n\r\nIn Node, there was an issue with bad `Object.assign` implementation in some Node version that caused different attribute order. But Fiber is resilient to that so it wouldn’t be a problem anyway.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1551\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-07-26 at 12 53 07 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/28619670-698f13ba-7201-11e7-9878-65f83e04751f.png\">\r\n\r\nTest plan: packaging fixtures work. For internal FB bundles, we didn’t use it in the first place (because we had our own polyfill).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1381\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-07-26 at 12 54 49 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/28619715-a4a1da1e-7201-11e7-903f-bcf6a96fe519.png\">\r\n",
