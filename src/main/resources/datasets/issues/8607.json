  "body": "This uses prepareUpdate to compute the diff to apply. If there is no work to do, we don't schedule any updates at all for the commit phase.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately wrapper components have custom logic that gets applied in the commit phase so for now we need to always schedule an update for those.\r\n\r\nThe payload has an array of only the prop key and values that need to update.\r\n\r\nThis makes the commit phase in the Sierpinski Triangle demo go from 2.5-3ms to <1.5ms. The overall time probably increases but at least now we won't risk dropping frames as we're updating low-pri content.\r\n\r\nA neat side-effect of this is that we no longer depend on any \"contextual information\" like host context or root instance in the commit phase.\r\n\r\nTODO 1: ~~This doesn't correctly apply the diff when the `is` property switches from custom component mode to built-in component mode. I'll just need to deal with that when deleting values.~~ Errr... This is not true. We can't switch between modes. I just added some unused code at some point because I thought we could.\r\n\r\n~~TODO 2: A more fundamental problem is that we always need to update the pointer to the \"current\" fiber atm because of how the lazy event listener thing works. I could probably change it to store the props object instead of going through the fiber.~~\r\n\r\n~~TODO 3: Flow infinite loops. (Updating to 0.37.1 doesn't help. https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8608)~~ Fixed using workaround.",
