The React documentation website only shows documentation for the current version of React.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template for React 16: https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/, template for React 15: https://jsfiddle.net/hmbg7e9w/).**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nDocumentation for previous versions of React is available somewhere.  Ideally, there's a version picker at the top of the page to select which version of React you're working with, like python.org (for example)\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nEvery version of React before the latest\r\n",
