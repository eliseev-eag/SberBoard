  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nSuspense adds display: none to all top level child elements in IE11.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/w0573w2owk\r\nCode sandbox can't render in IE11 either, but in this example I would expect to not see IE11 because the div would have display: none on it.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nTo be visible and not have display: none on the children.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nI had to revert back to react-loadable to fix this.\r\n",
