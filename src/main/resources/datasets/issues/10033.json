  "body": "We received an issue (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10022) related to a behavior exhibited in Firefox where extraneous zeroes (like `\"3.0000\"`) were dropped from the input display value. This can be observed here:\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/ps3s5v56/8/\r\n\r\nThere's nothing we can do about this, but the input number logic is pretty hairy. I wanted to make sure we had a test case to cover switching between the same number at a different level of precision (like from `\"3\"` to `\"3.000\"`, even if there's not much we can do about Firefox.",
