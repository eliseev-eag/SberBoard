  "body": "I was recently profiling a DEV build of React and noticed this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"728\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-04-04 at 15 48 53\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/38317573-3e36d3fc-3825-11e8-8777-6b65079bf38f.png\">\r\n\r\nSo almost 10% of the time was spent building component stacks for a warning that doesn't fire once. This is because the code looks like\r\n\r\n```js\r\nwarning(condition, message, getStack())\r\n```\r\n\r\nand so we evaluate `getStack()` regardless of whether it fires.\r\n\r\nWe already have a build step that \"hoists\" invariant conditions to prevent unnecessary work for invariants. In this PR, I extend an existing warning build step to do the same thing.\r\n\r\nEssentially it turns the above code into\r\n\r\n```js\r\nif (!condition) {\r\n  warning(false, message, getStack());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is nice both because it delays evaluating the arguments for the common case, and because we don't even have to step into `warning` at all.\r\n\r\nI enabled it in tests too for parity.\r\n\r\nOne potential pitfall is that it's easier to introduce a mistake into the argument calculation, and if it's never evaluated in tests, we'll never know. But we generally don't add warnings without tests so that seems like it won't be a big problem in practice.\r\n\r\nFull bundle diff: https://gist.github.com/gaearon/0bc2fd23d957e2ddc3939ef7425b3afd\r\n\r\nThis has no effect on production bundles because they don't contain warning calls.",
