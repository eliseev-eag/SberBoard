  "body": "Problem:\r\nLet's assume you are implementing a component suite providing some dozen superfancy ready-to-use components for React users.\r\nHowever, you do not know whether the users of your library are preferring JSX or normal JavaScript.\r\nIn the non-JSX case, most users surely want to write:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nFancyButton({ text: 'Click me' })\r\n```\r\ninstead of\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nReact.createElement(FancyButton, { text: 'Click me' })\r\n```\r\nSo far, for non-JSX users, providing a component as a component factory seems to be the better solution, whereas JSX users would surely prefer the component class itself (as \"createElement\" does not support component factories yet).\r\nThis is not very convenient. The component suite provider has to decide whether the components shall be provided as factories or as classes (respectively \"render functions\" in case of stateless functional  components) or whether she/he should always provide both versions at once.\r\n\r\nFeature request:\r\nWhy not promote component factories to first-class citizens in the React world (instead of downgrading them to \"legacy\" as currently planned) and make sure that functions like \"createElement\" etc. will support component factories at the same level as component classes (respectively \"render functions\" in case of stateless functional  components) are supported currently?\r\n\r\nBTW: By having access to the component factory you also have access to the component class/function via \"factory.type\" (which is considered \"deprecated\" by the React team - I do not know why, because \"factory.type\" seems very helpful). \r\n\r\nHere's a little example:\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/nse64ev9/\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance ",
