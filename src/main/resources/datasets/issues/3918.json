  "body": "Having run into several issues related to reading state that has been set but not yet committed to the component's state, I've been wondering why `setState` is asynchronous at all. Wouldn't it be better to do an async render instead? This would allow you to synchronously update state all you want, with the same performance benefits of async state changes.\n\nI'm imagining:\n1. `setState` mutates state immediately\n2. the same mechanism for batching state changes is invoked, only...\n3. the event originally causing state mutation simply triggers render instead\n\nThoughts?\n",
