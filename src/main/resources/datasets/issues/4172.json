  "body": "Freeze ReactElement.props in dev mode.\n\nThis diff removes the dev warning and freezes the props in dev.  This means there is a minor divergence in runtime behavior of dev/prod, and breaks devtools (new devtools on the way), but we knew/acknowledged those points.  As per @sebmarkbage, we are ok with these facts and still want to freeze.\n\nDetails: One might wonder why we freeze some things in the unit tests.  This is because phantomjs has a quark where it treats frozen objects as different from non-frozen.  Jest and Chrome don't care if things are frozen, but travis uses phantomjs, so, yeah.\n",
