  "body": "The update queue is in need of a refactor. Recent bugfixes (#12528) have exposed some flaws in how it's modeled. Upcoming features like Suspense and [redacted] also rely on the update queue in ways that weren't anticipated in the original design.\r\n\r\nMajor changes:\r\n\r\n- Instead of boolean flags for `isReplace` and `isForceUpdate`, updates have a `tag` field (like Fiber). This lowers the cost for adding new types of updates.\r\n- Render phase updates are special cased. Updates scheduled during the render phase are dropped if the work-in-progress does not commit. This is used for `getDerivedStateFrom{Props,Catch}`.\r\n- `callbackList` has been replaced with a generic effect list. Aside from callbacks, this is also used for `componentDidCatch`.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [x] Class components\r\n- [x] Host roots\r\n- [x] Fix Flow\r\n- [x] ~Update React DevTools dependency on `hasForceUpdate` (in a separate repo)~ I reverted this change",
