Obviously server side rendering is impossible via JSFiddle, but the markup should be equivalent to having rendered `Test` into a div with id `test-1` during server side render.\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/y8o5n2zg/\r\n\r\nAs seen in the fiddle, an attempt to ReactDOM.hydrate() a portal results in:\r\n> `Warning: Expected server HTML to contain a matching text node for \"Hello World\" in <div>.`\r\n\r\nAdditionally, after failing to hydrate, React renders the component and appends it resulting in a duplicated section of DOM:\r\n> `<div id=\"test-1\">Hello WorldHello World</div>`\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIn an ideal world, calling hydrate on a component that has portals would allow those DOM containers to hydrate into the components they were rendered with.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI've only tested this in 16.4.1, but I've confirmed the behavior in Chrome and Firefox. Given that I'm really looking at an edge case here I doubt it worked previously.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### *Why* I'm doing this edge-case-y nonsense:\r\n\r\nWe're currently using multiple React roots on our pages (as some portions of the pages are not rendered by React yet), most of which are server-side rendered. We'd like to be able to hydrate them into a single React root on page, so that we can share contexts between them without difficulty and without repeating those context components in memory (in some cases we can have a good number of roots on the pageâ€”20-30, perhaps?).\r\n\r\nIn searching, I found a few potentially related bugs (#12615, #10713, #11169), but it seemed like these really didn't line up with my (hopefully valid?) use case.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",
