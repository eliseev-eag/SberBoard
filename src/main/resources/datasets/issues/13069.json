  "body": "This removes our runtime dependency on fbjs for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n* We didn't get much value from it, the changes are pretty rare\r\n* It obscures what we're bundling and sometimes is more generic than we need\r\n* It drags some runtime dependencies that we don't use\r\n\r\nI had to fork www's invariant and warning. Technically they were *already* implicitly forked (because www's CommonJS resolution gave us a different module) so this is just making it implicit. Warning needs to be forked because of blacklists, and invariant needs to be forked because of differences in production argument formatting logic (which goes through `ex` internally).\r\n\r\nNote: to fully get rid of it we'd also need to remove it in `prop-types` (https://github.com/facebook/prop-types/pull/194).",
