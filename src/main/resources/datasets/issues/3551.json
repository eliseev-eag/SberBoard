  "body": "In an existing project with a complex directory structure of js files we are moving them one at a time over to React components. The existing build system takes all of the js files in this structure and produces the final built files. In these directories we take one js file at a time and convert it to a jsx file.\n\nWhen a *.jsx file changes, the compiler builds the resulting js file but then re-builds the same file again when the js file is added to the tree.\n\nTo reproduce assume the directory structure of:\n\n```\njsx-test\n  \\src\n    source.jsx\n```\n\nFrom within `jsx-test` run `jsx -wx jsx src src` it will build the source.jsx file.\nMake a change to the source.jsx file and you'll notice that it builds it twice, the second time after the js file gets added to the tree. \n",
