  "body": "We will need a way to get host nodes in React DevTools with the new API. We currently get them by reaching into `ReactDOMComponentTree` directly but I propose to transition to using devtool API (#5306) for this so that other renderers can provide their own host nodes when they become available.\n\nI propose that the renderer code would emit something like\n\n``` js\nif (__DEV__) {\n  ReactInstrumentation.debugTool.onSetHostNode(inst._debugID, node)\n}\n```\n\nwhen node becomes associated and \n\n``` js\nif (__DEV__) {\n  ReactInstrumentation.debugTool.onSetHostNode(inst._debugID, null)\n}\n```\n\nwhen it is deassociated.\n\nFor DOM renderer, it would [happen here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/c7ef0af54b86f86acb2198bb2b7f921e205b06c3/src/renderers/dom/client/ReactDOMComponentTree.js#L44-L56).\n\nThen we would add `getHostNode()` to [ReactComponentTreeDevtool](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/c7ef0af54b86f86acb2198bb2b7f921e205b06c3/src/renderers/shared/devtools/ReactComponentTreeDevtool.js) that would handle `onSetHostNode` event.\n\nDoes this sound reasonable? Longer term it would make [something like this](https://twitter.com/CamJackson89/status/734353190502727680) possible in userland.\n",
