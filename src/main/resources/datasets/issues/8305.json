  "body": "Firstly, congrats on the release :)\r\n\r\nWith the  v15.4.0 update, a couple of our projects tests are failing given the changes to `ReactTestUtils.Simulate` as discussed here:\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7642#issuecomment-244516991\r\n\r\nThe work-around was to use `ReactTestUtils.SimulateNative` - however it's still not entirely clear what the difference between `Simulate` and `SimulateNative` are? When and why should one be used over the other?\r\n\r\nIt feels like these docs should be updated to reflect this change:\r\nhttps://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#simulate\r\n\r\nFinally, is there a reason that `SimulateNative` does not appear in the docs? I'm concerned that others are going to be caught out by this change also.",
