  "body": "Added some tests for the non-DOM version of Scheduler that is used as a fallback, e.g. Jest. The tests use Jest's fake timers API:\r\n\r\n- `jest.runAllTimers()` flushes all scheduled work.\r\n- `jest.advanceTimersByTime(ms)` flushes only callbacks that expire within the given milliseconds.\r\n\r\nThese capabilities should be sufficient for most product tests. Because jest's fake timers do not override `performance.now` or `Date.now`, we assume time is constant. This means Scheduler's internal time will not be aligned with other code that reads from `performance.now`. For finer control, the user can override `window._sched` like we do in our tests. We will likely publish a Jest package that has this built in.",
