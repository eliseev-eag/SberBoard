  "body": "Docs say about refs in shallow rendering:\n\n> Shallow testing currently has some limitations, namely not supporting refs. \n\nHowever, if I shallow render a component, the `ref` property is present correctly. We're using it in react-shallow-testutils like this:\n\nhttps://github.com/rkovacevic/react-shallow-testutils/commit/b20af04fef4ade7df111e131792bb178794a789a\n\nIs this feature stable, can we rely on `ref` being present? \n",
