Otherwise any newly added invariants can't be [\"decoded\"](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/f0ba6bbf200e301e97c3170f42f12bd2d20fd967/scripts/jest/setupTests.js#L57-L75), as they're not in the committed error code file.\r\n\r\nI noticed this in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11652. Will see if the same fix there works. If it does, I'll merge this.",
