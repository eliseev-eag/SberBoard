This makes sense when the component is first created within the client. However, it doesn't make sense when the component has been hydrated, as `componentDidMount` is called after the content is already visible, and possibly after the user has already scrolled.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to add a `componentWillHydrate` lifecycle method? Then I could do something like this to achieve the desired behavior:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncomponentWillHydrate() {\r\n  this.hydrated = true \r\n}\r\ncomponentDidMount() {\r\n  if (!this.hydrated) {\r\n    this.scrollToTop()\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nAll",
