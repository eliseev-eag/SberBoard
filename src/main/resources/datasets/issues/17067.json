  "body": "I have a pattern question.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking of using a pattern where I extract my logic in higher-order components, so components are actually \"dumb\".\r\n\r\nSo instead of\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Signup = props => {\r\n  const [onSubmit, {data}] = useMutation (SIGNUP_GQL)\r\n  return (\r\n    ...\r\n  )\r\n}\r\nexport default Signup\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll do\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst withMutation = gql => C => props => {\r\n   const [onSubmit, {data}] = useMutation (SIGNUP_GQL)\r\n   return <C onSubmit={onSubmit} data={data} />\r\n}\r\n```\r\nonce, and then just\r\n```js\r\nconst Signup = ({onSubmit, data}) => (\r\n  ...\r\n)\r\nexport default withMutation (SIGNUP_GQL) (Signup)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo far I haven't encountered any problems (up to many typo's ðŸ˜‰). However, the docs say that hooks can only be called inside the body of a functional component. So my question is whether `withMutation (..) (..)` count as a functional component for this definition.\r\n\r\nAnd in general the question is whether react hooks have full support in HOC. My naive understanding is that those two approaches should be *fundamentally* equivalent regardless of the implementation. But I want to make sure, and if they aren't, whether the developers plan to support HOCs going forward. I am structuring my whole project this way, so that's why this is important to me. And I haven't read the hooks implementation, so not versed in how it works.\r\n\r\nCheers. ðŸ™‚",
