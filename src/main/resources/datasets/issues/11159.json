  "body": "`<input autoFocus />` works on the client but not when hydrated.\r\n\r\nThat's because this used to be implemented in JS as a special case but `hydrateInstance` doesn't cause a commit effect to be scheduled that can call `.focus()` like `finalizeChildren` does.\r\n\r\nThe question here is, should we even bother implementing this in JS anymore or should we just emit the `autofocus` attribute in SSR and let the browser take care of it.\r\n\r\n",
