  "body": "* 5a12260: **Added invariant check for native dispatching an unsupported event type**\r\nThis prevents a case of a silent failure when native dispatches an event that JavaScript does not know how to handle.\r\n* 633235e: **Added iOS direct event type \"onSnapshotReady\"**\r\nThis is used for snapshot testing. I missed it initially since I didn't gather event types from test-specific native views.\r\n\r\nThese issues were uncovered while running integration tests during a React Native fbsource sync.\r\n* Before this fix, our snapshot tests failed due to timeouts.\r\n* After commit 5a12260, snapshot tests failed with: _Unhandled JS Exception: Unsupported top level event type \"topSnapshotReady\"_\r\n* After 633235e, snapshot tests pass.",
