  "body": "This is a temporary change I want to get into 15.0.\n\nWe intend to change the measurement format significantly in #6046. **In order to introduce the new `ReactPerf` with a different and more detailed measurement format during 15.x release cycle, I propose to make the measurement structure opaque-ish in 15.0.**\n\nI searched the GitHub for usage of `ReactPerf.getLastMeasurements()` and couldn’t find any popular projects relying on its internal structure except React Native in [this single module](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/14555063bb496973f19f198bf05a2802efbde4e4/Libraries/Utilities/RCTRenderingPerf.js#L53-L61). I left `__unstable_this_format_will_change` as a workaround in case RN makes a release with 15.0 before we ship 15.1 with the new `ReactPerf`, or if anyone else really needs reading those measurements in the raw form.\n\nIn any case I will be working on updating React Native to use the new `ReactPerf` later so I don’t think we should be held back by this. It’s likely that by the time React Native is ready to switch to 15, the new `ReactPerf` will be ready, but if not, `__unstable_this_format_will_change` covers their use case.\n\nAll existing methods continue to work with the measurements returned from `getLastMeasurements()` so we aren’t breaking the contract. We’re just signaling that the internal format of measurements is an implementation detail in 15.0 until we iron it out and present the new, more detailed one, in 15.1.\n## Test Plan\n\nVerify that `ReactPerf.printExclusive()`, `ReactPerf.printInclusive()`, `ReactPerf.printWasted()`, `ReactPerf.printDOM()` still work both with zero arguments and with a single argument obtained from `ReactPerf.getLastMeasurements()`. Verify that `ReactPerf.getMeasurementsSummaryMap()` still works with a single argument.\n## Reviewers\n\n@sebmarkbage \n",
