  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\n_bug_\n**What is the current behavior?**\n1. Create list of elements, which contains just _one_ element. Element key is undefined.\n2. Render list properly.\n3. React throws warning: `VM60 react-with-addons.js:22809 Warning: Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique \"key\" prop.`\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\n\nThis is an example: https://jsfiddle.net/ah0r5ffs/\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nExpected behavior: list contains just one element, therefore, key is unique. Warning shouldn't be displayed. \n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\nAppeared in the following versions: (\"react\": \"15.3.1\", \"react-dom\": \"15.3.1\")\nThis worked in previous version. (\"react\": \"15.0.2\", \"react-dom\": \"15.3.1\")\n",
