  "body": "I love that there are \"invariant\"s everywhere, but sometimes the errors they report aren't immediately understandable. For example, if a mixin defines a default prop that's also defined in your component, you get the lovely error:\n\n```\nUncaught Error: Invariant Violation: mergeObjectsWithNoDuplicateKeys(): Tried to merge two objects with the same key: [the duplicate key was here]\n```\n\nIt took me a while to figure out the cause. [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/kb3gN/592/)\n\nAnother I've run into is `Each child in an array should have a unique \"key\" prop. Check the render method of undefined.` (console.warn'd) Which happened when I had passed in an undefined function as an `onClick` prop.\n",
