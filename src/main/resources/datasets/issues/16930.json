  "body": "Now that hooks have an easy, non-HOC, non-renderprop, way of accessing context:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst value = useContext(MyContext);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt'd be great to be able to do the same thing from class components, i.e.:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst value = MyContext.currentValue;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know there would be caveats like \"don't capture the value\" (b/c when the context value changes, you'd want to be sure you're using the latest currentValue on each render), but hooks also have caveats about usage.",
