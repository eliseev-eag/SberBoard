  "body": "Move \"actual\" time tracking attributes onto the `Fiber` object and track for every `Fiber` within a `Profiler` tree. This change is being made so that DevTools has the ability to display timing info for all components in an application (or a subtree) simply by flipping the root `Fiber` and its alternate to `ProfileMode`.\r\n\r\nThis change should have no impact on the production bundle since the newly added fields are stripped out if `enableProfilerTimer` is disabled. It should have minimal impact on the dev and [production profiling](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12886) bundles since measurements are only recorded if `ProfileMode` is active.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] All existing unit tests pass.\r\n- [x] Bundle size isn't impacted for non-profiling builds. (See below.)\r\n- [x] Reset \"actual\" time durations for all Fibers after commit- even ones that didn't update due to bailouts. (Otherwise their durations will accumulate for the next eventual re-render.)\r\n- [x] Don't reset durations before DevTools commit hook is called. (Otherwise DevTools will be unable to read these values for profiling mode.)\r\n\r\n### Bundle sizes\r\nBuilt after rebasing on master:\r\n![screen shot 2018-05-25 at 9 52 24 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/40556403-5e31b330-6001-11e8-8e56-663d84187475.png)",
