  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen `ReactDOM.createPortal` is used with a container in a new window (by calling `window.open()`), and `window.getComputedStyle()` is called on a DOM node found in the container an `Unspecified error.` is thrown in IE. This seems to work fine in Chrome, and Firefox, but in IE (running version 11.0.09600.19003) it throws an error.\r\n\r\nThe issue can be seen in the following CodeSandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/zk7895x5n3\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nCalling `window.getComputedStyle()` on an element in a portal located in a new window should work in IE like it does in the other browsers.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nI see this issue in React/React-dom v16.3.2, IE v11.0.09600.19003 (running in VirtualBox on a Mac).\r\n",
