  "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nI usually am in the situation where I have to write code like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nreturn (\r\n  <div className={classnames(['...', '...'])}>\r\n    Children\r\n  </div>\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems simple, but when you have more elements that need dynamic classes, it gets tedious and pretty hard to read. I propose the following thing:\r\n\r\nWhen `className` attribute is evaluated, how about running it through [`classnames`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames) before rendering the HTML?\r\n\r\nThis means that the `className` attribute should allow `Array<string>`, `{[string]: boolean}` and `string` types and would become much simpler to write code.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?",
