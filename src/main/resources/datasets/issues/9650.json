  "body": "Doing this first on master, then will cherry-pick to 15.6 branch.\r\n\r\n**what is the change?:**\r\nSwapping out `warning` module for a fork that uses `console.warn`.\r\nIt looks like we were using the `warning` module for deprecation notices, *but* there is also a 'deprecated' module designed specifically for deprecation notices.\r\n\r\nHowever, we could not find any place that it was currently used.\r\n\r\nSince React's build process is not 100% clear to me, I assume it could still be used somewhere by something and just updated it along with other deprecation notices.\r\n\r\nWe might consider a follow-up diff that does some clean up here;\r\n - remove 'deprecated' module if it's unused, OR\r\n - use 'deprecated' module for all our current deprecation warnings\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\n- We have had complaints about noisy warnings, in particular after introducing new deprecations\r\n- They potentially cause CI failures\r\n- Deprecations are not really time-sensitive, can ship without breaking your app, etc.\r\n\r\nFor more context - https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9395\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\n`npm run test`\r\nAlso planning to do some manual testing and paste in screenshots in comments to show how the changed warnings look.\r\nThere are some failing snapshot tests that seem unrelated, but looking into those also.\r\n\r\n**issue:**\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9395\r\n",
