  "body": "The _owner field is unnecessary since it's reachable from _currentElement.\n\nThe _lifeCycle field is unnecessary because an internal component should\nnot even need to exist at all if it's unmounted. It should be dereferenced\ninternally, and never exposed externally.\n\nThe only case where it's important is for batching updates where we\ncurrently avoid calling performUpdateIfNecessary if it's mounted. However,\nthis function is already only executed \"if necessary\" so we just make sure\nthat it's not necessary after unmount by resetting all the pending fields.\n\nDrop ReactOwner.Mixin. This is not used anywhere else. To avoid over-abstraction we should just inline this.\n\nDrop this.props internally. It's only exposed on the public instance.\n\nDrop inaccessible methods that are no longer accessible and the isOwnedBy check\nis only used in a method that is not accessible.\n",
