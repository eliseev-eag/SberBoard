  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nI have a list of components that change their height based on their internal state (open/close) and close after the user clicks outside that component (so only one is open at a time). It's possible to toggle other component's onClicks that are above the currently open component but not the ones below it. It seems that onClick doesn't fire on the components that are in different position than initially rendered.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template for React 16: https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/, template for React 15: https://jsfiddle.net/hmbg7e9w/).**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/6z6nov18zw\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThat both components above and below the component open when clicked.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior can be achieved by using addEventListener.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16, tested on Firefox/Chrome/Safari\r\n",
