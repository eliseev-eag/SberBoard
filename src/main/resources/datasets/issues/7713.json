  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\n- feature \n\nRef this tweet from Dan - \nhttps://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/775647965197336576\n\nIt's currently too easy to use React in `development` mode while in production, and there's little warning from the library that this is happening. Further, it takes a fair bit of googling to know what to do, (it's tucked away under 'advanced performance' in the docs, _and_ doesn't include directions for webpack/browserify). \n\nAs a start, I recommend that react _always_ log a message to console when it's in development mode. Something like - \n\n\"running in development mode, use [production mode flags](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/advanced-performance.html) to speed up your code\"\n\nThis stands out, and I hope will prevent some, if not most, of these misses. \n",
