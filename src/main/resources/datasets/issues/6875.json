  "body": "Couldn't find a react-docs repo or anything, so I'm posting it here.\n\nI just spent the past 30 mins googling how to get webpack to build React in production, and the page https://facebook.github.io/react/downloads.html wasn't very clear.\n\nI ended up having to hunt down a \"production is undefined\" error, and ended up asking on the IRC before I could get a clear answer.\n\nThe CORRECT way to build react in production, is to add the following to your plugins array:\n\n```\nnew webpack.DefinePlugin({\n    'process.env': {\n        NODE_ENV: '\"production\"'\n    }\n}),\n```\n\nWould be great to get this on the docs. Notice that production is a string, containing `\"production\"` with LITERAL double quotes. Here is the page (might be others too) in question: https://facebook.github.io/react/downloads.html \n",
