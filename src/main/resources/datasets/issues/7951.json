  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nfeature\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\nA React element like `<div data-foo={'&bar'} />` renders as `<div data-foo='&amp;bar'></div>`.\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nThe above behavior is expected in the majority of cases; it is [strongly recommended on w3.org](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/guidelines.html#C_12).\n\nHowever, in some scenarios (an automated parser that does not play nicely with encoded special characters, etc), a user may want to render arbitrary strings into attributes, without the automatic encoding.\n\nIn the same way that `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is provided for entire elements, we could have a `dangerouslySetAttributes`: \n\n```\nconst getAttributes = () => ({ \"data-foo\": \"&bar\" });\n\n<div dangerouslySetAttributes={{__attributes: getAttributes()}} />\n```\n\nCurrently, a workaround I'm using is to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` on the container element of the node. Being able to set the attribute specifically would be a bit safer.\n\nThoughts? I'm on the fence as to whether this is a good idea, since it opens up another avenue of inserting invalid HTML. Nevertheless, I'm interested in hearing if it can be justified on the same grounds as `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.\n",
