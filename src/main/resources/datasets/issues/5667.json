  "body": "Since react-dom introduced, I am sorry it is really buggy to me how to bundle React in my projects, because the following line in index.js: \n\n```\nmodule.exports = require('react/lib/ReactDOM');\n```\n\nIt means the `react-dom` will require the file `ReactDOM.js` directly, and I have to require the same source code too.\n\nHowever, to save the time to bundle react and make my React component unaware whether it is `react` or `react/addons`, I always bundle the `react/dist/react-with-addons.min.js` or `react/dist/react.min.js` directly, and use browserify expose them as `react` for other module.\n\nIt makes my component can always start with the following line:\n\n```\nvar React = require('react') // whether it is react or react/addons\n```\n\nBecause usually I bundle react in a site-core.js for all other app in the website, the site-core.js is completely independent. It use browserify to expose `react` for other module to require.\n\nIf some components want react, and some components want react/addons, till the end, you have to require react/addons. The component only need `react` will get nothing, so I expose `react/dist/react-with-addons.min.js` as `react` for all.\n\nNow, the problem is, react-com always want to require `react/lib/ReactDOM`, it will require a duplicated React when i bundle `react-com`. I see `require('react/lib/ReactDOM')` as a temp solution, so I am asking if any plan to de-couple react-dom from react ? Sorry for asking :)\n",
