  "body": "I suspect this applies to all SVG elements, but I only know `<g>` for sure. Due to lack of an SVG `<image>` I'm needing to use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. I created a [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/9quroqqv/1/) to demonstrate the issue. This will switch between two images of Tux each second. It will also dump `innerHTML` to the console after each render.\n\nEvery browser renders correctly initially, but only Chrome can update.\n- Chrome: Everything works as expected\n- Firefox: the `<image>` gets converted to an `<img>` and disappears. I assume because it's now an HTML `<img>` inside an SVG context.\n- Safari: `innerHTML` looks fine, but the image never changes.\n- IE 11: `innerHTML` looks fine, but the image never changes.\n",
