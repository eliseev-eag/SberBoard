  "body": "Fixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8260.\r\n\r\nIt removes the `error` event listener which caused all jsdom errors to be ignored. We still *silence* some of the errors, but at `console.error` call time. The benefit of this approach compared to our existing `event.preventDefault()` call is that we still *fail the test* if the error was unexpected (like described in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8260). And it's nice to remove the weird hack with mucking the error prototype.\r\n\r\nI implemented silencing by adding a few special cases to our `console.error` mocks that ignore certain messages (see `shouldIgnoreConsoleError.js`). I've spent a few days trying several other explicit approaches before that. They were all too annoying and complicated, and led to too much noise in tests themselves. Especially because we have many different configurations (dev, prod, bundles). Ignoring ended up the most straightforward (and hopefully maintainable) solution. And that's what we were effectively doing anyway, except at an earlier stage.\r\n\r\nFor the few cases where we were testing logging itself, I changed those to directly overwrite `console.error` and assert on the mock calls. Seems easier than remembering what gets mocked and when. I also made the test non-internal while I was at it.",
