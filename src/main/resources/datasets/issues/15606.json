  "body": "This doesn't happen with deprioritization since those are not \"updates\"\r\nby themselves so they don't go into this accounting.\r\n\r\nHowever, they are real updates if they were scheduled as Idle pri using\r\nthe scheduler explicitly. It's unclear what suspense should do for these\r\nupdates. For offscreen work, we probably want them to commit immediately.\r\nNo point in delay them since they're offscreen anyway. However if this is\r\nan explicit but very low priority update that might not make sense.\r\nSo maybe this means that these should have different expiration times?\r\n\r\nIn this PR I just set the suspense to the lowest JND.\r\n\r\nHowever, we don't want is for these things to commit earlier in case\r\nthey got batched in with other work so I also ensured that they're not\r\naccounted for in in the workInProgressRootMostRecentEventTime calculation\r\nat all. This makes them commit immediately if they're by themselves, or\r\nafter the JND of whatever they were batched in with.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I think that we should probably never schedule anything at\r\nNever that isn't truly offscreen so this should never happen.\r\n\r\nHowever, that begs the question what happens with very low pri work that\r\nsuspends. Do we always work at that level first?",
