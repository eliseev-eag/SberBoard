  "body": "As per my chat [here](https://twitter.com/nickdima/status/723904527083147264) with @gaearon I'm filing an issue to discuss this further.\n\nI would like to avoid a specific element that I rendered on the server from beeing further updated by react once it reaches the client.\nOne specific use case is rendering ad server tags that are kind of a pain in the ars, using things like `document.write`, etc. I render them using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` but sometimes when React is doing the reconciliation client side they get re-render so they stop executing. Now I managed to track down some of these cases by fixing render differences between server and client which would trigger DOM patching but it still seems to happen.\nAny advice?\n",
