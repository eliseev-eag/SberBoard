  "body": "In the server side rendering example, the initial startup js function calling `React.render` is being generated dynamically via PHP. In the comment it says I really should be using webpack instead of browserify. It isn't immediately clear what that means.\n\n```\n// index.php\n// Generate the code required to run the component on the client\n// We assume that the Browserify bundle is loaded in the page already\n// and that you used -r to get a global require() function that provides\n// every $module you may request as well as React.\n// Note that this solution is simple but I don't think it scales to\n// multiple large pages very well. For that you'd be better off using\n// webpack.\n$startup_code = <<<SCRIPT\n<script>\n(function() {\n    var React = require('react');\n    var Component = require($module_for_js);\n    React.render(\n      React.createElement(Component, $props_json),\n      document.getElementById($container_id_for_js)\n    );\n  })();\n</script>\nSCRIPT;\n```\n\nCan someone elaborate on this? In what way do I use webpack instead of browserify? Thanks.\n",
