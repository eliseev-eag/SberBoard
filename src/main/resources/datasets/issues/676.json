  "body": "Hi all, I was learning and reading through the documentation of React and I've realized it is awesome, even the docs page.\n\n> But I think it can be improved, in order to be more social and _community-driven_.\n## The main idea\n\nBuild a section like the one who Yeoman's has (yeoman.io/community-generators.html), or the one who GruntJS's has (http://gruntjs.com/plugins), in which I can see all the 3rd party components created on top of React framework.\n### Establishing a standard\n\nWhen authoring public React components, the user should follow a standard, for example, publishing the component to Bower, adding them a prefixed namespace, for example, if I'm creating a _Tree_ component, then I should register it on Bower as `react-component` in order to make it findable and indexable by the section page.\n\nAny thoughts?\nRegards.\n",
