  "body": "I thought that this might be broken but looks like it's not. I still suspect that we'd have to do the rethrowing (of multiple captured promises) in the complete phase. I can't think of a case where this breaks though. I think this is because the potential bug only happens if we're in an \"invisible\" tree but we only want that to count if the invisible tree is a preferred boundary. In the case an avoided boundary is the only thing that is invisible, it doesn't matter because we want to use the inner most boundary anyway in those cases.",
