  "body": "Hey guys!\nSo in this application I'm writing there's a component called \"help section\". It's basically a box that shows some predefined texts about the component the user's messing with.\n\nI want to be able to tell my \"help section\" component which component to show help for. As of now, I'm using Flux with some actions and a store. This isn't too bad and works quite nicely, however it's quite a large setup, with 2 files defined specifically for this cause. There are also a number of other issues that I've experienced such as \"help section\" actions dispatching because of other actions (which raises a \"Cannot dispatch in the middle of a dispatch\" error).\n\nHowever, if I could define \"help section\" as a **singleton**, I could just `import helpSection from './HelpSection` and be done with it, since I'll get the **instance** of \"help section\". All I have to do is expose a method on `helpSection` that sets the properties I want to change and call it.\n\nI know it breaks React's unidirectional data flow, with a component changing another component, but maybe it's worth it sometimes. The way I think about it, it's sort of a combination of a store, some actions and a component into one object. A lot of components will only get instantiated once at run time so maybe it'll be quite useful in some cases.\n\nI couldn't find any reference to this on the web other than in [this JSfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/7764/), which seems to work nicely (It's a bit unclear IMO). Is this a good way to do it?\n\nI'm quite a novice in JavaScript and React so I might be missing some obvious points, hopefully not.\nWhat do you think about this?\nThanks for reading.\n\n(P.S. Sorry for any ambiguousness, English is not my native language... :smile:)\n",
