Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nTry the following code in a project using Flow:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// @flow\r\n\r\nimport { hydrate } from 'react-dom'; // Flow error: This module has no named export called `hydrate`.\r\n\r\n// calling it as a method on the default export also fails:\r\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\r\nReactDOM.hydrate(); // Flow error: property `hydrate` not found in ReactDOM\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIt should not cause any Flow errors.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nreact-dom 16.2.0\r\nnode 8.9.4\r\nflow 0.64.0\r\n\r\nI don't think it has ever worked.\r\n",
