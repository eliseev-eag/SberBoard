See the codepen below.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion this is a bug because it breaks the isolation of components and forces me to change my way of writing conditional components when using hooks with `useState`.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/reacthooksbug-n529s\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nComponents with `useState` hooks never share their state.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI have reproduced this with versions 16.8.2 and 16.8.6 (did not try it with others).",
