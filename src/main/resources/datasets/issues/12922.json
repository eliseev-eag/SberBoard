Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nExample is as follows: http://jsbin.com/yawasoz/1/edit?html,js,output\r\nAdd some item, click on it, try to edit it.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nTo work like this (React 16.3): http://jsbin.com/luzimujiwi/1/edit?html,js,output\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nI think this happens only in React 16.4, 16.3 seems to work fine (same code, different React version): http://jsbin.com/luzimujiwi/1/edit?html,js,output",
