  "body": "We added integration with Danger in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11865.\r\nIt shows a bundle size difference on PRs, like this: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12028#issuecomment-358717464.\r\n\r\nWe should change the output so that production bundles are bold in the results. I think we can also remove the red triangle on increase from the development bundles because they're not as important.",
