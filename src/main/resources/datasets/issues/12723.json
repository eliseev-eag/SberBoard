  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIn tests, if the component passed to `root.findByType` was created using `forwardRef` it can't be found.\r\n\r\nIf I use `root.find` to loop over all the nodes and log `.type` I see that the ref-forwarding-component is skipped entirely.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/k0o70vjv07?module=%2Fsrc%2Findex.test.js\r\n\r\nI expect the second test to work like the first, however the second test is failing.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThis may just be the way that `forwardRef` works, but the reason I expected it to work is I'm using it to make wrapped controls, like the `<FancyButton>` example from the documentation. When writing tests I want to be able to find a `FancyButton` and test it's besing passed the correct props, and not have to check that the DOM rendered by `FancyButton` is correct; that's already being tested in `fancy-button.test.js`\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nUsing React 16.3.2, failing in Chrome and Node 8.11.0\r\n\r\nI've tried all the `16.3.x` versions in codesandbox and they all failed.",
