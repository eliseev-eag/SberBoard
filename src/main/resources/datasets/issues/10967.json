  "body": "I tried moving the TypeKit tag from the bottom of the `<body>` to the `<head>` but this didn't resolve the flicker. According to [the docs](https://helpx.adobe.com/typekit/using/embed-codes.html) this is actually expected. TBH this flicker existed on the legacy site as well so I'm not sure how high-priority it is but it _is_ annoying.\r\n\r\nSo I'm now leaning towards removing TypeKit entirely and just using `sans-serif` font. Joe is going to circle back to this tomorrow and try out some other fonts that don't require using TypeKit (eg San Francisco). I think we could merge this PR for now (to remove the flicker) and then merge his later (to make things look better).\r\n\r\nNetlify preview: https://59ce854bdf99532e00fdf5d0--reactjs.netlify.com/\r\n\r\ncc @vjeux",
