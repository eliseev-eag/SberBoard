  "body": "It seems that I can't fetch multiple APIs in a single hooks and use arrays to return values.\r\n\r\nCode Sandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/ykly7w7w9x\r\n\r\nSay I have components  which need to fetch data with several APIs,  I would like to abstract the hook into a single `useMultipleFetch`. But the problem is state would not update after fetching finished. I must manually update the state by resize the window to force states update.\r\n\r\nexpected : \r\n\r\n```\r\nFetch result (expected 3 `done`)\r\n[\"done\",\"done\",\"done\"]\r\nisLoadings result (expected all `false`)\r\n[false,false,false]\r\n```\r\nbut got: \r\n\r\n```\r\nFetch result (expected 3 `done`)\r\n[\"\",\"\",\"\"]\r\nisLoadings result (expected all `false`)\r\n[true,true,true]\r\n```\r\nfor the first time.\r\n\r\nBTW use a single fetch hook would avoid this problem, so I guess it could be that React can't handle state as a nested array.\r\n\r\nIs this the wrong way I use it and is it not supported by React hooks? Or is there any other thing wrong?",
