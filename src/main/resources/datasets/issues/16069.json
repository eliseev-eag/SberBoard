Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nThe current warnings point the developer only to the source code, and it would be AMAZING if we'll easily see which component instance caused the warnings. Consider a list with hundreds of items, each rendering a component. ATM there's no convenient way to track down the renegade instance.\r\n\r\nSo instead of the current behavior:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6963212/60722000-479d8000-9f38-11e9-9295-a113dbac079d.png)\r\n\r\nAlso add:\r\n\r\n```\r\nindex.js:1375 Warning: Failed prop type: The prop `latitude` is marked as required in `RestaurantListItem`, but its value is `null`.\r\n\r\nRestaurantListItem's instance has the following props: {OBJECT_OF_PROPS_THAT_OPENS_ON_CLICK}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI currently find myself many times having to temporary do this in different components.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me like a very easy thing to add, at least for development build.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nI can take a swing at it with some guidance (I'd love to dip my toes in React's code)",
