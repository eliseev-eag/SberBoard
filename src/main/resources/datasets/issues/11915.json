  "body": "This doesn't measurably change anything, but makes the code clearer in my opinion.\r\n\r\nPreviously we had `ReactEventEmitterMixin` that exported a single `handleTopLevel()`  helper. This function was re-exported from \"specific\" modules like `ReactBrowserEventEmitter` and `ReactNativeEventEmitter`. The \"mixin\" naming refers to it previously being `Object.assign`-ed, although it's not the case anymore since we migrated to ES Modules.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the mixin is extremely tiny and just calls two functions on `EventPluginHub`. At first I wanted to inline it into the \"specific\" emitters, but then I realized I might just put it into `EventPluginHub`. This got me thinking: why do we even expose `enqueueEvents()` and `processEventQueue()` from `EventPluginHub`? Because we use them from `handleTopLevel()` and a few other places. But now that `handleTopLevel()` is in `EventPluginHub`, can we unify other callers behind a single method too? It turns out that they are always called one after another, so they might as well be unified into a single method. I did just that, and called it `runEventsInBatch()`.\r\n\r\nIn the second commit, I realized that there is no need to inject `handleTopLevel()` dynamically because it's always known statically, and we no longer rely on overriding it from tests (fixed in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11327). So I hardcoded it instead.\r\n\r\nIn the third commit, I renamed `handleTopLevel()` to `runExtractedEventsInBatch()` to make it clear that it is equivalent to `runEventsInBatch()` for the extracted events. I also removed a bunch of module redirects, and changed the callers to import it from `EventPluginHub` directly since neither of the redirect sites actually did anything with the arguments.",
