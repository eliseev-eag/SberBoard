  "body": "We have a fairly advanced class system that is integrated with react. With 0.10 we managed to make it work using stock build, with 0.11 and its refactoring of descriptors it is no longer possible. I know that in 0.12, React will have `createFactory()` as part of its public API, so is there a chance we can have it in 0.11.x? Perhaps hidden in `__internals`? It's important for us to have an unwrapped version of it, just a reference to `ReactDescriptor. createFactory()` method.\n",
