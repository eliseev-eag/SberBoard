  "body": "Consider the following scenario (or [run it](https://github.com/d4goxn/iso-form-issue-repro)), in a simple isomorphic app that consists of a single-input form.\n1. A form is rendered on the server with existing data and sent to the browser, along with dehydrated state\n2. The user edits the form\n3. The browser loads the app, slowly, which rehydrates its state and bootstraps over the form\n4. The user hits a save button\n\nAt this point, React has found no reason to rerender the form or throw a warning, even though the values of the form elements have been updated by the user before the app was listening to them. As a result, app state is out of sync with form input values. The user has just re-saved their old data (app state), but sees their new data (form values). If they leave, they lose their changes even though it appears that they just successfully saved.\n\nI have decided to solve the problem by putting a ref on every form input, and copying their values into app state on `componentDidMount`. I can probably make the solution a little more DRY than that sounds at first.\n\nI'm thinking that a better solution might be to have React include input values in the checksums. Is there a technical reason why this is not how isomorphic rendering already works?\n",
