  "body": "Hi, \n\nThe Flux architecture seems to recommend having React elements bind to change event listeners to Stores, and call `forceUpdate()` when changes occur. I do this, and generally find that deferring forceUpdate calls is more useful, as it prevents multiple calls to forceUpdate on the same tick (I think). \n\nThe idea comes from [react-mixin-manager](https://github.com/jhudson8/react-mixin-manager#deferupdate), which provides one implementation. \n\nPersonally, I have seen a performance boost (I think) from using the following simple mixin: \n\n``` coffee\nmodule.exports =\n  deferUpdate: ->\n    setTimeout =>\n      @forceUpdate()\n    , 0\n```\n\nI'm not sure if this is a good idea generally, or if it should be incorporated into React core, but I thought I'd throw it out there. \n(meta: are issues like this encouraged or frowned upon here? I know it's a large project with a lot of \"real\" issues the core devs need to be paying attention to.)\n",
