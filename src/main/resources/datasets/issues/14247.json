  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIn Webpack, when mode is set to 'production' and devtool is set to a setting that produces source-maps, React produces unexpected results. After long experimentation, I believe the behavior is caused by module concatenation. It affects one particular library, which I have included in the repo below.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/volkanunsal/webpack_bug\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe input field should not lose its focus, but does.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.6.0\r\n\r\nIt works only when the library is loaded as ES5. I'm not sure if it's a React bug or a Webpack bug, to be honest. So I'm filing it on both React and Webpack repos. \r\n",
