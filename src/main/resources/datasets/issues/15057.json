  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThe warning is triggered after an intricate sequence of events. I stumbled upon it by accident, assumed it was an error in my code, but then step by step removed everything in my application until I was left with a fairly small bit of code that doesn't seem to be doing anything illegal from the API point of view, yet is triggering a warning.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem:**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/q87882qv64\r\n\r\nThe example is my real application code trimmed down as much as possible to demonstrate the warning. So some of the code might be a bit nonsensical/contrived, but that's because I removed lots of surrounding code leaving only the relevant bits for reproducing the issue.\r\n\r\nIn other words, there might weird looking uses of useEffect and weird sequencing of things, but that sort of falls out of how I've structured my routes, state, components in the full app, etc.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would like to know if\r\n\r\na) is this a React bug that I stumbled upon that should be fixed?\r\nb) is this something I'm doing \"wrong\" and how I could fix that in my application (i.e. is this a real memory leak being caused because of the way I structured the code)\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.8.4",
