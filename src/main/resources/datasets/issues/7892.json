  "body": "Calling it modern feels weird although modern and classic are the internal folder names.\n\nThere’s been some chatter about `createClass` and `PropTypes` being generally in maintenance mode as `class` and `Flow` are the future. I was playing around with the build system anyway (see #7850 and https://twitter.com/iamdustan/status/783701952483856384) so decided to try to create a build removing `createClass` and `DOMFactories`. Potentially `createFactory` and `createMixin` could be removed as well.\n\nThe build of react-slim.js vs react.js is displayed in the screenshot below:\n<img width=\"511\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-10-05 at 9 14 54 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/227879/19137308/d084b2b2-8b40-11e6-9c0f-798cfef0c832.png\">\n\n**Diff**\n\n```\nreact-slim vs react: -31,869\nreact-slim.min vs react.min: -5,755\n```\n\nRemoving PropTypes may be problematic due to `context` still using it? This is part of an experiment I’m considering that would convert https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod/blob/master/transforms/class.js to a `babel` transform to run over arbitrary components outside of direct control (aka `babel` over `node_modules`. Heresy, heresy!)\n",
