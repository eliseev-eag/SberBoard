  "body": "More aggressive alternative to #5687, This PR tracks the value for all inputs and only fires a change when the value changed. This is similar in theory to how the onInput polyfill works **except** it doesn't track the value in `activeElement` but on the input DOM node. It certainly starts to edge into \"not to spec\" territory, but onChange is already pretty unique in React so perhaps that's not important.\n\nThe extra state tracking isn't ideal, but it has benefits over the track-when-focused approach. For one testing is easier. detached inputs will still fire onChange events, which will break a lot less existing tests. I could also track the value on the node instance, instead of the DOM node, but I wasn't sure if how ya'll feel about mutating the component instance that way.\n\nThe downside to this approach is that manually triggered events won't fire if the value hasn't changed. As far as I can tell there isn't a way to distinguish between naturally triggered events and manually triggered ones. Not sure if it's worth it, since most are triggered in testing by the ReactTestUtils, it might make sense add a flag that way?\n\nfixes #554, fixes #1471, fixes #2185 (that last one is probably caused by something else entirely but it was fixed in my testing)\n\ncc: @jimfb @spicyj @syranide \n",
