  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nNot sure, maybe more on the feature side\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen opening an iframe to a third party site, I need access to the user's camera. The new specs for Chrome states that since version 64, we need to add the `allow` attribute in order to have access to things like camera or microphone.\r\nHowever React (15.6.1) does not recognise this attribute and removes it. Therefore I don't have access to the user's camera.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<iframe\r\n           title=\"Open identification process\"\r\n           src=\"thirdparty.com\"\r\n           frameBorder=\"0\"\r\n           width=\"600\"\r\n           height=\"800\"\r\n           allow=\"camera; microphone\"\r\n         />\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error displayed in console:\r\n`Warning: Unknown prop `allow` on <iframe> tag. Remove this prop from the element. For details, see https://fb.me/react-unknown-prop`\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThis tag should be known\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact version: 15.6.1 (no real possibilities to change to 16 yet)\r\nChrome: Version 64.0.3282.140 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\nOS: MacOS Sierra\r\n\r\nSorry if this was already reported. I couldn't find another issue mentioning this.\r\n",
