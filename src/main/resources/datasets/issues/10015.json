  "body": "I'm about to start larger error handling PR to fix some outstanding bugs (see https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9210). This is a smaller one that cleans up some messiness that I noticed when reviewing the error handling logic.\r\n\r\nNo observable changes, just refactors the code a bit to make it easier to follow.\r\n\r\n- The first commit focuses on begin phase errors. It uses `performFailedUnitOfWork` instead of separately calling `beginFailedWork` and `completeUnitOfWork`.\r\n- The second commit focuses on commit phase errors. We have a special, forked version of the work loop that does an additional check on each fiber to see if it's an error boundary with an unhandled error. But this only relevant after the commit phase, because begin phase errors are handled using a stack unwind. So we should only run this loop right after committing.",
