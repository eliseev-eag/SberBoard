  "body": "ReactPerf and ReactDefaultPerf allow for profiling the react internals of ReactCompositeComponent but what I really think would be useful is for React to have a start(), stop() style for perfing the components. Or, possibly just track these methods automatically and spit out warnings. \n\nSome long range uses would be:\n- how many times did you call shouldComponentUpdate? what was the response? if you're always returning true, that might be insightful for your components.\n- how many times did you call setState? could compare this with # of render cycles to track forced renders possibly?\n\nI had started work in #4522 but that just needed to be closed. \n",
