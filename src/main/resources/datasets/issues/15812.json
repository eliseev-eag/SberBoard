For this components i use react hooks. After editing any of component i use `npm link`, and in project i use `npm link @mycomponents/core` and project crushes with this error:\r\n\r\n`Uncaught Invariant Violation: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component.`\r\n\r\nI was trying to publish `@mycomponents` in my repository and after publishing i run `npm install` and all works correct from node_modules.\r\n\r\nProbably problem with npm link\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nnpm link works correctly with hooks\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nreact: v16.8.6\r\nreact-dom: v16.8.6\r\nbrowser: Google chrome Version 73.0.3683.103 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n",
