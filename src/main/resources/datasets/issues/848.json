  "body": "Briefly spoke to @petehunt about this. Tracking it with an issue.\n\nThere are times when having multiple insertion points would be useful. The old Web Components spec was looking to do this with the `select` attribute of `content` - http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/#insertion-points. I'm not sure what the current W3C plans are.\n\nPete said that this could be done for now by passing other children in as props. But it feels like a hack.\n\nRiffing on that old spec's idea, something vaguely like this:\n\n``` html\n<div>\n  <div class=\"header\">\n    { select(this.props.children, '.title') }\n  </div>\n  { this.props.children }\n</div>\n```\n\nWhere the `.title` string is a CSS selector, and any matching elements are removed from the `children` to avoid duplicate insertion.\n",
