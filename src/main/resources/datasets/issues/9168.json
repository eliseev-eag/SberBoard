But why?\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem**\r\n\r\nDemo: https://jsfiddle.net/superKalo/jdqe74uv/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIf I understand well how [the way keys work](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys), I would expect to get the same warning with the nested array of `data`, just like the one with the flat array of `data`, since in both cases there are no `key` attributes set.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nSpot on React 15.4.2.\r\n\r\nTested on Chrome 57.0.2987.98, Firefox 52.0 and Safari 10.0.3 on macOS Sierra.",
