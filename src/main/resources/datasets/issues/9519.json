  "body": "I want to make a proposal to add Accessibility documentation to the React docs.\r\n\r\nBeing a great fan of both accessibility and React, I have experienced how well React can be geared to easily adding accessibility features. Adding docs about it would maybe help with more accessible React apps being built out there.\r\n\r\nAs base for the proposal I have created a taste of the docs it would become. However, I would first like to test if this kind and style of accessibility docs would fit the vision of the maintainers before spending too much time on it.\r\n\r\nHere is a snippet from a section of what I have already made:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5063473/25382404/c4206e7e-29b7-11e7-9ca3-d023f5d3c088.png)\r\n\r\nI have gone for the Eutopia, with a section in the main menu being dedicated to accessibility. It is very hard to bring the necessary basics home in a one pager, I think. I know it is a big ask to add a major section to the docs but maybe it would be great to show off a11y as a first class concern in the docs.\r\n\r\nSo the sections I have in mind are:\r\n\r\n**Building accessible forms**\r\nHere I have already created a section on labelling but it needs to be extended with validation error texts.\r\n\r\n**Controlling focus**\r\nShowing how showing focus on form controls should be maintained and how one can ensure that keyboard users do not get frustrated by losing focus and how to bypass blocks of content in pages.\r\n\r\n**ARIA roles, states and properties**\r\nAn overview of what ARIA is and how can be used to create more complex accessible widgets\r\n\r\n**Developer tools**\r\nA look at tooling that makes accessibility visible for developers. Examples would be browser a11y inspectors, `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, `react-axe`, `aXe` itself and a quick how to on screen readers.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing your comments :-)\r\n",
