  "body": "I'm thinking that propTypes could be extremely useful in vanilla JavaScript that I write. I'm just exploring the possibility right now, but I am wondering how difficult it would be to pull propTypes out of React into a standalone VanillaJS library. If it sounds like a reasonable thing to do, where would I start?\n\nEdit: I should be more clear. What I'm really after is the ability to add type checking to my functions without using something like TypeScript (not that TypeScript is bad, but I'm investigating alternatives). It would be awesome to have an abstraction to check arguments to a function the way that `propTypes` checks the properties given to components. That's what I'm really after.\n",
