  "body": "This has been suggested and discussed before: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/74, https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/221, https://github.com/facebook/esprima/pull/6, etc.\n\nBut it seems to me like the discussions rather died out than a rejection of the issue. So here's for one final resurrection of the issue, with a proper implementation, using the XML-namespaces as seemed to be preferred by @jeffmo.\n\nIn my opinion, this issue points to a very pleasant _but not required_ feature that vanilla JS has, that JSX currently lacks. To me, it also highlights a possible issue with respect to best practices for sharing components and frameworks, as this may have impact design decisions depending on the authors preference for JS or JSX. Having to locally require and assign every single component intended to be used is _tedious_ and unnecessarily verbose. Simply being able to refer to a collection of components, as we easily can in JS, should be available to JSX as well.\n\n``` JS\n// In plain JS\nvar MyDOM = require('MyDOM');\nMyDOM.ComponentA(null);\nMyDOM.ComponentB(null);\n\n// In existing JSX\nvar MyDOM = require('MyDOM');\nvar MyDOM_ComponentA = MyDOM.ComponentA;\nvar MyDOM_ComponentB = MyDOM.ComponentB;\n<MyDOM_ComponentA />\n<MyDOM_ComponentB />\n\n// In enhanced JSX\nvar MyDOM = require('MyDOM');\n<MyDOM:ComponentA />\n<MyDOM:ComponentB />\n```\n\nThis brings JS and JSX to parity on this issue in my opinion, without inventing custom features or weird syntaxes, and it seems to me that this should not block any important future design decisions (that would be compatible with JSX), and it's entirely optional for the user.\n\nTechnically, the JSX implementation quotes invalid JS identifiers resulting from unusual characters in namespaces or tags (when possible), which explains the implementation of `quoteNamespacedTagName`.\n\nThis PR depends on https://github.com/facebook/esprima/pull/7 for `fb-esprima`, which is why the tests are failing.\n\nAll feedback and criticisms are appreciated.\n\nFixes #74.\n",
