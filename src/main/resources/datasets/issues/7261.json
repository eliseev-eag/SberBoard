  "body": "[Dependency CI](https://dependencyci.com) is a new service out there.\nIt checks the status of the projects dependencies post commit.\nIt is able to read the dependencies from package.json and checks the dependencies for various metrics, e.g. for being deprecated, unmaintained or check the license.\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\nCurrently when adding or updating dependencies you have to check them manually.\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nEnabling this could just give some additional metrics on the dependencies of the project. \n\nIt is free, fast and does not need any integration than signing up with GitHub giving it access to the repo and enabling the switch.\nOther large open source repositories like pm2 or Mozilla's Servo have already enabled it.\n",
