  "body": "Seems to me that this will be a hairy one to fix.\r\n\r\nThe warning/error messages emitted from React often rely on string substitution of the native console.log function to give necessary location of the problem.  But when the console.log functions are patched in applications to redirect messages to the server for logging, say, in json format to a file, the templates' string substitution parameters are lost.  ex. `Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique \"key\" prop.%s%s` which isn't very helpful to see in the log in a large project with many developers.\r\n\r\nI believe this could be easily addresses in the logger patch if there were a reliable way to assign the output of native string substitution to a new javascript string (so that the full string message could be wrapped in json metadata AFTER the substitution), but this native string substitution doesn't seem to be available to javascript and there's no way to get resulting string.  We could add a javascript implementation of string substitution such as https://github.com/anseki/console-substitute, but there's [not much of a spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console#Using_string_substitutions).\r\n\r\nCould these messages be templatized in React in a different way?",
