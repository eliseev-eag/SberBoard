  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nPotential bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nA dependency I am using is using `create-react-class` to get past the deprecation warning, but they have still defined `getDefaultProps` in their class definition. I am still getting the following warning from that:\r\n```\r\nreact-with-addons.js:4946 Warning: getDefaultProps is only used on classic React.createClass definitions. Use a static property named `defaultProps` instead.\r\n```\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\nI can't use jsfiddle because create-react-class appears not to have a CDN version. I will try to create a minimal amount of code to properly reproduce this tonight.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI'm not exactly sure. Is it supposed to trigger this warning when using `create-react-class`?\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 15.5.4\r\nOS Windows 7\r\nBrowser Chrome 58.0.3029.110 (64-bit)\r\n",
