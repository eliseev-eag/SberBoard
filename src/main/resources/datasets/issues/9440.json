I think using ES6 in the docs is a good idea, but what about giving the reader more ability to understand the code?\r\n\r\nConcept:\r\n\r\n![react tutorial page](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/936069/25067709/2cd09f34-2201-11e7-96d7-cd343d2ea70b.png)\r\n![react tutorial page with es6 class popup](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/936069/25067742/efbc9fe8-2201-11e7-800c-79fdee1d6daa.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe take text from [Babel's ES6+ Guide](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/#ecmascript-2015-features-classes) and modify it a bit to fit the surrounding content.\r\n\r\nThis could be done across the site, but it's most important in the tutorial.\r\n",
