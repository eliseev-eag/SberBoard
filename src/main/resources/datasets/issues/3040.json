  "body": "`react@0.13.0-x` gives us possibility to use JavaScript prototype based inheritance instead of using `React.createClass` method. The only problem that it brings is the need to explicitly bind DOM event handlers to the component, since React's autobinding works only for classes declared with `createClass`. \n\nAt the same time it looks weird. Even if native DOM event listeners work in the same manner, I don't think, that it is a good example to follow. Please notice, native DOM APIs were introduced \"thousands years ago\" :) Don't get me wrong, but I don't see any usecases where event handler should be called within the context of the global `window` object.\n\nWouldn't it be better to React itself to bind DOM event handlers to the class instance?\n\nImaging one has a custom `Button` component (inspired by the [bem-react](https://github.com/dfilatov/bem-react) project):\n\n``` js\nclass Button extends React.Component {\n  ···\n  _onFocus() {\n    this.setState({ focused : true });\n  },\n\n  _onBlur() {\n    this.setState({ focused : false });\n  },\n\n  render() {\n    return React.createElement('div',\n      { className : 'button' + this.state.focused? ' button_focused' : '' },\n      React.createElement('button',\n        {\n          className : 'button__control',\n          onFocus : this._onFocus,\n          onBlur : this._onBlur\n        },\n        this.props.text));\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI would expect `focus` and `blur` event handlers would be called with `Button` instance context. But they would not. So an error will be  thrown, as no global `setState` method there :(\n\nLet me be clear, I know about ES6 arrow function, as well as other ways to bind function to the context. However as React has it's own EventListener internally, I think it might be possible to provide the desired behaviour out of the box. \n\nWhat do you think?\n",
