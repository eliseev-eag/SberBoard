  "body": "This ensures that our tests expecting Symbol not to exist pass.\n\nI was running the tests in node v4 where Symbol exists and one of the tests was failing (the parse & stringify test). It turns out what we were doing to delete Symbol wasn't working so we were actually getting our XSS protection when we weren't expecting it. @spicyj was correct in assuming that what we were doing wasn't going to work. So I fixed it and then added a test to ensure that we are using the Symbol-less fallback (and also reformatted a line). cc @sebmarkbage @cpojer \n",
