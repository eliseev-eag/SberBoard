  "body": "As per conversation with @sebmarkbage, it would be cool if React emitted events that allowed any attached devtools to listen for relevant events occurring in the core.  The emitted events could be just descriptive enough that devtools could track whatever internal state it wants.  For instance, a devtool could track perf by seeing how long various operations are taking (marked by start and end of the operation).  Or a devtool could emit useful warnings (all our core warnings could be rolled into a devtools module/package, and by tracking state internally we could avoid routing the only-useful-for-warnings data throughout the core).\n\nAnyway, the following are relevant:\n- [ ] https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5302 - User wants to emit custom warnings when potentially slow operations are executed during render.\n- [ ] https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4302 - Users want to clear warnings for unit testing and/or hot-reloading\n- [ ] https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5254 - Users want to track/monitor calls to `shouldComponentUpdate` and get statistics on the results.  Gather other per-component statistics like number of setState calls and renders.\n- [ ] https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5924 - Users want to fail unit tests when specific warnings fire, like an invalid checksum warning.\n- [ ] https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6239 - User wants to render errors using a pluggable logging framework.\n",
