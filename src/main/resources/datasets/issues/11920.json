  "body": "I was poking through the UMD `react-dom.production.min.js` build and noticed that the namespaces exported from [`DOMNamespaces`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-dom/src/shared/DOMNamespaces.js) are being inlined as string literals.\r\n\r\n[First Example](https://gist.github.com/aweary/da7ed93a94b7c8ddf65c569be61e8356#file-react-dom-min-js-L1779-L1794)\r\n[Second Example](https://gist.github.com/aweary/da7ed93a94b7c8ddf65c569be61e8356#file-react-dom-min-js-L1872-L1873)\r\n\r\nThis isn't great since they are sort of long strings. I'm not sure if its a bug or expected behavior for some component of the build system, but I thought I'd report it in case something can be configured?\r\n",
