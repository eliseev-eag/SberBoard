  "body": "Feature request\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\nCurrently `ReactDom.renderToString()` must synchronously render a complete component.\n\nThis means that react servers which connect to other data sources must wait for those to respond before beginning to send an HTTP response.\n\n**What is the desired behavior?**\nSupport server-side use of `encoding: chunked` by \n- Exposing a streaming render API e.g. `ReactDom.renderToStream()`.\n- Providing a way for react components to 'block' rendering server-side\n\n**What would this improve?**\nThis would enable much lower latency in cases where a server is connecting to multiple backing services to service a request, because content early in the document can be delivered to the browser before all backends have responded.\n",
