I'm making the test check those too.\r\n\r\nSince the existing test *also* verifies the Scheduler UMD bundles, I added getters to those to make sure the API matches up. But that's not the important part of this fix. The important part is just adding those constants to \"scheduler internals\" for UMD.\r\n\r\n![fix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/53180841-553c1400-35ee-11e9-8c1a-be27ec5c2977.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\nNote this means that even ReactDOM 16.8.3+ won't work correctly with older React UMDs. This might be surprising but it breaks often enough for UMDs that it's probably okay.",
