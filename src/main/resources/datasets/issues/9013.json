  "body": "**Note** This PR has changed significantly since it was initially created. (See commit history for more.)\r\n\r\nAddressed a circular dependency between `NativeMethodsMixin` and `ReactNativeFiber`:\r\n* Created new `ReactNativeFiberHostComponent` with similar interface but without unnecessary call to `findNodeHandle`.\r\n* Created new Flow interface for mixins to ensure `ReactNativeFiberHostComponent` and `NativeMethodsMixinUtils` stay synced.\r\n* Moved helper methods to `NativeMethodsMixinUtils` to be shared between the 2 wrappers.\r\n\r\nFixed bug in `createReactNativeComponentClass` that allowed duplicate view names to be registered and added a unit test to guard against a regression.",
