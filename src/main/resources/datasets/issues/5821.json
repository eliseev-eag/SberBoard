  "body": "A component should either be using uncontrolled inputs or controlled inputs, but not both (they should pick a single paradigm, for the lifetime of the component).  As a result, an instance of an input should never switch from controlled to uncontrolled (or vice versa).\n\nWe should warn when an input that was previously controlled becomes uncontrolled, or vice versa.\n",
