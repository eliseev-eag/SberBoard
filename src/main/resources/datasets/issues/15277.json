  "body": "I am not sure this is a react bug. \r\nWe had a production build one week ago, on Mar 21 2019. The GC system worked well when switching between tabs. But I made an other build recently (Mar 29 2019), the view was not able to free and the memory leaked badly. I used same branch, same dependencies on this build. So I assume it may due to some dependency on our dependency was updated. It seems like that the component was held by memorizedProps. Does anyone met similar issue as I did recently? \r\nReact version I use is: 16.8.3\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1820864/55286381-d47eed80-53cd-11e9-9ed1-b07b5241c3e9.png)\r\n",
