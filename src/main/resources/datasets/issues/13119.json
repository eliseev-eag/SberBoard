You cannot finish the game, there will be two fields remaining unfilled , so the game will end here without a winner.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nEither you say you have a max of 9 moves, false moves count and give a warning like, you left out of moves\r\nor\r\none should be able to complete the game.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n>  \"react\": \"^16.4.1\",\r\n>     \"react-dom\": \"^16.4.1\",\r\n>     \"react-scripts\": \"1.1.4\"",
