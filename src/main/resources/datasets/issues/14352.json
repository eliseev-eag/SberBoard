  "body": "As reported in open source (facebook/react-native/issues/21967), the `useEffect` hook is broken for React Native when using JavaScriptCore (which affects both iOS and Android).\r\n\r\nThis is because the [`setTimeout` branch of `scheduler`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/c2a2d8a539bf02e40c43d36adc2826e228f30955/packages/scheduler/src/Scheduler.js#L463-L495) specifies a [5000ms delay](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/c2a2d8a539bf02e40c43d36adc2826e228f30955/packages/scheduler/src/Scheduler.js#L483). This 5000ms is _supposed to be the maximum expiration time_, but in this fork it _ends up being the minimum callback time_ (unless another state update forces us to sync-flush pending callbacks). Since `useEffect` is passive, this means React won't call it until after a few seconds have passed.\r\n\r\nI assume we (React team) haven't noticed this because we're typically using the `postMessage` implementation, but with JavaScriptCoreâ€“ React Native ends up using the `setTimeout` fork.\r\n\r\nI think this was broken by commit 4d17c3f (PR #13740) which intentionally changed the delay under the (mistaken) assumption that it would only impact unit tests.\r\n\r\nIf we want to avoid using `setTimeout` for React Native, I think we'll need to add a `scheduler` implementation that does not require `postMessage` or `MessageChannel`, since JavaScript Core does not support either.",
