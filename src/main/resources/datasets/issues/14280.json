Builds on top of #14260 ([view the delta](https://github.com/bvaughn/react/compare/automated-release-scripts-part-4...bvaughn:automated-release-scripts-part-5?expand=1)).\r\n\r\nAdds a simple snapshot test of the release script's \"prepare stable\" functionality. This test checks out a specific CI artifact and prepares it for stable release. It then compares the diff that results from the version number substitutions to a known good diff and fails if it's changed.\r\n\r\n(Note that if we add new packages or change e.g. `packages/shared/ReactVersion` we will want to update the test's CI version and re-generate the snapshot.)\r\n\r\nThis test isn't _that_ helpful but would give us a sanity check after modifying the `prepare-stable` script. I won't be upset if we don't think the test is worth it. ðŸ˜„\r\n\r\n**[Learn more about these new release scripts here.](https://github.com/bvaughn/react/blob/automated-release-scripts-part-4/scripts/release/README.md#react-release-scripts)**",
