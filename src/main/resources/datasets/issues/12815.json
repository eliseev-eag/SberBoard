  "body": "<!--\r\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\r\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHey there! It seems to be minor issue for web, since browsers normalises attribute cases on their end, but e.g. it is a major issue for email-targeted markup which results in buggy behaviour across some clients.\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nPotential Bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nSome attribute names are converted to lowercase, and some are not:\r\n```js\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\nimport { renderToStaticMarkup } from \"react-dom/server\";\r\n\r\n// Sample use-case, not an actual code\r\n// Notice that first 3 props are lowercased in result, but next 3 are not\r\nconsole.log(\r\n  renderToStaticMarkup(\r\n    <table\r\n      contentEditable\r\n      tabIndex=\"1\" \r\n      autoFocus\r\n      autoCapitalize=\"true\"\r\n      cellPadding={10}\r\n      cellSpacing={10}\r\n    />\r\n  )\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nCode above outputs next result:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<table contenteditable=\"true\" tabindex=\"1\" autofocus=\"\" autoCapitalize=\"true\" cellPadding=\"10\" cellSpacing=\"10\"></table> \r\n```\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n[![Edit r4q3kkmq9p](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/r4q3kkmq9p)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nAll attribute names are lowercased, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<table contenteditable=\"true\" tabindex=\"1\" autofocus=\"\" autocapitalize=\"true\" cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"10\"></table> \r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on [supported html attributes docs section](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#all-supported-html-attributes) I couldn't find a pattern on whenever React decides when to lowercase the name and when not. Both `tabIndex` and `cellPadding` are listed, but only first one outputted as expected.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n```\r\nreact-dom@16.3.2\r\nreact@16.3.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nHaven't tried with older React / ReactDOM versions.\r\n\r\n**Updated:** I found related issue https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10863, but my argument would be more about compat issues with mails. It's definitely an edge case thought.",
