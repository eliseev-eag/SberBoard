  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nA bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThe `htmlFor` attribute on `label`s is not behaving consistently across browsers when VoiceOver is enabled.\r\n\r\nIn Chrome, the label value is announced by VoiceOver when an input receives focus (as expected): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFX3SWFYbY&feature=youtu.be\r\n\r\nIn Safari, however, the label value is not announced by VoiceOver: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ-0HuMf0bk&feature=youtu.be\r\n\r\nI was able to get VoiceOver to announce the expected label in Safari by adding an `aria-labelledby` attribute to the inputs:\r\n```javascript\r\n<label htmlFor=\"FullName\" id=\"FullNameLabel\">Full name</label>\r\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"FullName\" aria-labelledby=\"FullNameLabel\" onChange={this.onNameChange} value={this.state.name} />\r\n<label htmlFor=\"EmailAddress\" id=\"EmailAddressLabel\">Email address</label>\r\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"EmailAddress\" aria-labelledby=\"EmailAddressLabel\" onChange={this.onEmailChange} value={this.state.email} />\r\n<label htmlFor=\"Info\" id=\"InfoLabel\">Are there any considerations you would like to share with the instructor (e.g., injuries, sensitivities, requests)?</label>\r\n<textarea id=\"Info\" aria-labelledby=\"InfoLabel\" onChange={this.onInfoChange} value={this.state.info} rows=\"5\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nUsing `htmlFor` should suffice to get VoiceOver to read the expected label value across all browsers.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16.3.2\r\nChrome and Safari on MacOS High Sierra with VoiceOver enabled\r\n",
