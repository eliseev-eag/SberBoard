  "body": "<!--\r\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\r\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReact throws: `TypeError: Cannot call a class as a function` when trying to define a stateless component as a `class`.\r\n\r\nI understand the way to do this with:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst MyStatelessComponent = () => (\r\n  <div>MyStatelessComponent</div>\r\n)\r\n\r\nMyStatelessComponent.propTypes = {\r\n  size: PropTypes.oneOf(['s', 'm', 'l'])\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport { MyStatelessComponent }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the problem with doing it that way is that you can't define a static method or property to that component (i.e. propTypes) and have that component be tree-shaken by webpack. I don't know the details behind why that's the case, but it is.\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nCurrently, stateless components can only be defined as functions, but not classes\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nA stateless component should be able to be defined as a class with a constructor, so that a static getter can be set. Webpack knows how to tree shake static properties or methods defined that way.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass MyStatelessComponent {\r\n  constructor () {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>MyStatelessComponent</div>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  static get propTypes () {\r\n    return {\r\n      size: PropTypes.oneOf(['s', 'm', 'l'])\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport { MyStatelessComponent }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nNot an issue, but a proposal. It does not work in any previous versions of React, to my knowledge.\r\n",
