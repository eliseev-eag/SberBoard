By removing some things on that component, i figured out that is a problem within a HOC provided by react-apollo, but I don't know exactly what it is because it doesn't show me any information.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nI actually do not have any way to reproduce it quickly.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nRender correctly the website.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact - 16.9.0\r\nReact-DOM - 16.9.0\r\nBrowsers - Safari and Chrome (tested)\r\n\r\nWorking if downgrading to React-DOM 16.6.1\r\n",
