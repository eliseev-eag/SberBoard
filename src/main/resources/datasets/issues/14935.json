I recently wrote this code, which works fine at the moment, and didn't realize the possible issue until @gaearon pointed out the missing `useEffect()`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport function useDidChange(value) {\r\n  let ref = useRef()\r\n  let didChange = ref.current !== value\r\n  ref.current = value\r\n  return didChange\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf a warning is not possible due to the lazy initialization pattern, perhaps an eslint rule may be a solution?\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nAll versions",
