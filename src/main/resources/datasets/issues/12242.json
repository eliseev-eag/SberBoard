  "body": "## Problem\r\n\r\nWhen creating a select element and setting multiple the first element would be selected. This was due to the multiple prop being set after the children we're appended.\r\n\r\nAn non-react example case created by @aweary can been seen here - https://jsfiddle.net/dm6vkq9q/\r\n\r\n## Tradeoffs / Misc\r\n\r\nIn my original solution I added a new hook to set props for just the select element before the children we're appended. This worked only because it was setting just the select props first. An alternative idea proposed was to switch the order of appendChildren > setProps to setProps > appendChildren. this will not work in the instance that we have a defualtValue set for our select input. When we change this order a defaultValue is ignored. There we're also many other tests that broke in this process. Although this is bit of a hacky solution this will not require us to make any dangerous changes to the code base.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nIn postMountWrapper in ReactDOMFiberSelect.js I set selectedIndex for the select element to -1\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12200\r\n\r\n## Related closed pull requests\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12240\r\n\r\n@aweary @gaearon ",
