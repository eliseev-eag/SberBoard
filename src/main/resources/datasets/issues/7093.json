  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nThis is a bug.\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\nWe server-render a page that has a style tag and the style tag is created using `React.createElement`. When that later gets re-rendered without a `style` element we see an error in the console:\n![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/163637/16224243/7a09a39a-37a1-11e6-849b-e6aa70e709f3.PNG)\n\nNote that this only happens when we server-render that page. If we turn off server rendering the error goes away. The DOM looks like this:\n\n![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/163637/16224293/b3905ca8-37a1-11e6-9502-94e9ba4c8e97.PNG)\n\nThe error also goes away if we do:\n\n```\n<style dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: children[0]}} />\n```\n\nInstead of:\n\n```\nReact.createElement(tag, props, children);\n```\n\nAnd it also goes away if we do:\n\n```\nReact.createElement(tag, props, children[0]);\n```\n\nSo it seems that the `style` element expects only one child.\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\nI haven't been able to create a small reproducable, but I hope that I've narrowed it down enough to be clear. If not then tell me and I'll try to create a reproducable again.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n15.1.0\n",
