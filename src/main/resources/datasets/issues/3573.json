  "body": "React has two types of linked states: valueLink and checkedLink. Neither work well for radio buttons, which have no mutable value and which the `checked` attribute is a somewhat degenerate parameter, in that there is additional work to be done to understand which radio button is actually selected.\n\nIt would be great if we could add something akin to the valueLink for text inputs, which would set a state variable to the defined value, like so:\n\n```\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"mygroup\" value=\"first\"    radioLink={this.linkState(\"myval\")}/>\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"mygroup\" value=\"secondth\" radioLink={this.linkState(\"myval\")}/>\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"mygroup\" value=\"thirdst\"  radioLink={this.linkState(\"myval\")}/>\n```\n\nSay the first radio button was clicked, then after the change, the state would have a variable named `myval` with the value `first`.\n\nThis can probably be achieved by adding a few lines to LinkedValueUtils.js. It's arguable whether the linked value could also serve as the group name, or even have the radio type implicitly set just by having a radioLink attribute, but I believe the syntax should be kept as close to the other link types, plus the type/name verbosity gives context to the code.\n\nDoes this use-case warrant a such feature .. ?\n",
