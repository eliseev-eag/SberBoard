  "body": "\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\n_Feature_ for [eslint-plugin-react-hooks](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) `exhaustive-deps` rule\r\n\r\n**tl;dr version**:\r\n`exhaustive-deps` does not work well with dependencies of `Array` type and actual `auto fix` suggestion might break the code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nDemo repo: https://github.com/lukaskl/exhaustive-deps-and-array-variables\r\nCodeSandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/zxz5801rm4\r\n\r\n\r\n**Context**\r\n\r\nReact hooks have a way to pass `dependencies` as an array:\r\n```\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  ...\r\n}, [dependency1,dependency2]);\r\n```\r\nHowever, those dependencies are compared `shallowly` and that means if a `dependency` is of type `Array` React will not be able to detect changes within that array and it is necessary to calculate a derivative value of this array (_e.g._ `array.join(',')`).\r\nSimilar suggestions were given by different authors: [inventingwithmonster.io](https://inventingwithmonster.io/20190207-how-to-fix-final-argument-passed-to-useeffect-changed-size-between-renders/) or [facebook/react#14324 (comment)](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14324#issuecomment-441489421)\r\n\r\n**The problem**\r\n\r\n`react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` is not able to detect that `derived value` is calculated for the `dependency`, an example of this can be seen here: [src/Toasts.js#L27](https://github.com/lukaskl/exhaustive-deps-and-array-variables/blob/master/src/Toasts.js#L27)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4083977/56234771-328b2080-60b0-11e9-8d6c-402a1f120ef9.png)\r\n\r\nalso the suggested `auto fix` for this `eslint problem` actually breaks the code, as it changes \r\n```\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    setHeights(heights => calculateHeights(childKeys, refs, heights));\r\n  }, [childKeys.join(',')]);\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    setHeights(heights => calculateHeights(childKeys, refs, heights));\r\n  }, [childKeys]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich leads to an `infinity loop`\r\n\r\n### The question/suggestion\r\n\r\nI know that there is a workaround - simply disable the rule for a single line\r\n```\r\n// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\r\n```\r\nHowever, it is barely desired outcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I have a question of either:\r\n\r\n**a)** maybe this situation is antipattern in the first place and there is an objective suggestion how to transform components that all dependencies would consist only of `primitive` types?\r\n\r\n**b)** maybe it is worth to extend `exhaustive-deps` rule by adding an option, that the `derived value` of a `dependency` would be recognised as the `dependency` itself?\r\n\r\n### Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?\r\n\r\n- react: ^16.8.6,\r\n- react-dom: ^16.8.6,\r\n- react-scripts: 2.1.8\r\n- eslint-plugin-react-hooks: ^1.6.0\r\n",
