  "body": "I've got more to report on this problem with react-scripts not found error.\r\nHere is the error running 'npm start'\r\n\r\n```\r\n/myapp/front# npm start\r\n\r\n> front@0.1.0 start /myapp/front\r\n> react-scripts start\r\n\r\nsh: 1: react-scripts: not found\r\nnpm ERR! file sh\r\nnpm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE\r\nnpm ERR! errno ENOENT\r\nnpm ERR! syscall spawn\r\nnpm ERR! front@0.1.0 start: `react-scripts start`\r\nnpm ERR! spawn ENOENT\r\nnpm ERR!\r\nnpm ERR! Failed at the front@0.1.0 start script.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf one runs 'npx react-scripts start' it forces a rebuild of the entire 1980 packages?!!\r\nBut it does eventually run.\r\n\r\nThe setup issue is that the Ubuntu VM is running on an NFS Mount from Win8\r\n\r\nFirst problem is all the bin files can't build, but if you build initially on VM's disk image VDI, and then copy back to real files over an NFS mount the second problem is it can't copy symbolic links (maybe an option to copy the source if symlink fails exists or should).\r\n\r\nOkay so once you have the symbolic links repaired in windows via mklink after copying the initial build from a none NFS mount folder, well that's when this problem described above happens.\r\n\r\nI am unclear on which one of the 1980 packages other then this react-scripts is in need or a total rethink but it doesn't cut it when setup in this way. (Using symbolic links seems literally unacceptable.)\r\n\r\nIt seems not unreasonable to think you should be able to use your platform/IDEs of choice and have the UNIX VM mount and work of those NFS Mounted files. The way all this stuff is build falls short of this I call expected behaviors. \r\n\r\nThe only problems are why isn't 'npm start' able to run 'npx react-scripts start', and in turn why does that not understand the package is already built and take forever to rebuild all packages every time? I think it also relates to file watching. Maybe there is a way to deploy this without waiting 10 minutes to launch a simple example.\r\n",
