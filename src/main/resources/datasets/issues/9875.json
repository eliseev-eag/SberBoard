  "body": "This is built on assumption all Fiber tests are passing including warnings (which will happen soon).\r\n\r\nI have removed all tests lists (since presumably they all pass), and change `npm test` to test Fiber by default. You can opt into testing Stack by running it with `REACT_DOM_JEST_USE_STACK=true`.\r\n\r\nSince we don't need to keep a list anymore, I deleted a separate Circle task and replaced it with a normal Jest call with this environment variable. If some code change breaks Stack, it will still fail the CI.\r\n\r\nThe `expectDev()` convention no longer has special meaning but I'd like to keep it and in the future repurpose it for testing PROD flat bundles with our unit tests.",
