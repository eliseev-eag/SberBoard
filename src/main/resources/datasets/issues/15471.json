  "body": "I'm currently updating the new React DevTools to use suspense for more interactions (https://github.com/bvaughn/react-devtools-experimental/pull/196). This has uncovered three pain points that we should try to address:\r\n\r\n1. ~~**Using the \"two `setState` pattern\" can be awkward** if the priority is \"normal\" or higher (as was the case in my \"keydown\" event handler) because `scheduler.next` uses \"normal\" priority for this case. (This also applies to e.g. non-React event handlers, since the default priority for these is \"normal\" as well.) **Temporary workaround** - manually run the first update with user-blocking priority.~~\r\n\r\n2. ~~**Offscreen updates** cause user-blocking and normal priority work to be batched together (for unknown reasons). This makes interactions feel unresponsive. **Temporary workaround** - none (other than to stop using offscreen priority).~~\r\n\r\n3. **Fallback UI shown too quickly**. One of the main reasons to use suspense in the \"inspected element\" panel to begin with is to avoid a quick flash of the \"Loading...\" fallback when a new element is selected. However, it seems like this is still happening even with suspense. **Temporary workaround** - none, since I don't know the cause.\r\n\r\n**Edit** I think the first two items I reported were caused by a second/duplicate scheduler package that had gotten installed in DevTools as a transient dependency.",
