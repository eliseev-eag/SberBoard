  "body": "There's a few different things here that was a bit difficult to untangle.\r\nThe goals were:\r\n\r\n* Make sure common invariants give the same messages with client and server render.\r\n* Throw in the same cases. Not throwing in SSR but throwing on the client makes warnings very confusing.\r\n* Turn \"new features\" on for the DOM integration fixture since we're only working on new SSR now.\r\n* Make sure we have tests for top level rendering (strings, numbers, arrays).\r\n\r\nI'll add more inline comments for specific changes.",
