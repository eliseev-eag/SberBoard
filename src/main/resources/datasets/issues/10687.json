  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nI believe this is a bug that was introduced in version 15.6. It also exists in the latest tagged version.\r\n(v16.0.0-rc.2)\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen running functional tests using selenium and the safari web driver (https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/SafariDriver), using the \"sendKeys\" method doesn't trigger an onChange event of an input field. This appears to be safari only, however, I've only tested in Chrome and Safari. The result is the the app doesn't see the text in the form input fields. (In our case, we can't log in when running our automation tests, because the username field thinks it's empty, even though the text appears to be in the field)\r\n\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/ebsrpraL/).**\r\n\r\nIt's a rather complicated setup process if you don't already have selenium working, but assuming you have a selenium test set up, it's very simple to reproduce.\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a clean react 15.6 app. \r\nEdit the App.js file to include `<input id='test-text' onChange={this.onTextChanged}/>`\r\nAdd this method above the render function `onTextChanged() {\r\n    console.log('onTextChanged');\r\n  }` \r\nRun the selenium test that types into the new input field.\r\nYou'll notice that the console logs have not mention of \"onTextChanged\"\r\n\r\nIf you edit the packages.json file to use react 15.5, remove the node_modules folder, and re-run yarn install and yarn start; you'll notice the you do in\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nYou should notice a console log instance of \"onTextChanged\" for each character typed into the input field.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, chrome is not effected by this issue, and the issue appears to be introduced in version 15.6.0. \r\n\r\nReverting our app back to 15.5.4 allows our automation tests to run, if this could be fixed in v16, that would be great as we won't be upgrading until this is resolved. Please let me know if I can provide any more useful information.",
