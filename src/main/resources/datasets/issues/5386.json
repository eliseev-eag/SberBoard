  "body": "Hello again.\n\nthis strikes me as a bug, it is certainly annoying and difficult to workaround. If you control an input and set the value asynchronously, say with a setTimeout as in the example, the cursor position is reset to the end of the input.\n\nin the below jsFiddle, try typing in the middle of the input text the cursor should reset to the end of the line.\n\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/19927/\n\n**Addendum** I see that native inputs exhibit the same behavior is you, say use jquery and setinterval. To me tho that is still not the behavior you'd want, since in a controlled input scenario you know when the value is actually changing.\n",
