  "body": "I spent the last hour trying to fix an issue that was caused by me trying to render a `CSSTransitionGroup` when the actual variable was undefined.\n\nThe root cause was me misinterpreting that `require(\"react/addons\")` would return the whole `React` instead of just `React.addons` (which is my bad), but the error itself and the stack trace were extremely cryptic and it took me a while to even get a clue that the reason why it wasn't working was that I was just trying to render an undefined type.\n\nThis is the actual exception:\n\n```\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'defaultProps' of undefined\n```\n\nAnd here's the stack trace:\n\n![developer tools - http___localhost_3000_requests_new from_template 3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/886011/5201545/dda098f6-7573-11e4-9bed-4db35dbc520d.png)\n\nYou can see that, ultimately, execution comes crashing down when React tries to look at `defaultProps` on my undefined type, which of course raises an exception.\n\nThe reason why this was confusing to me is that the exception happened quite far away from the source cause and, as a secondary factor, this code worked completely fine before I started porting it to Browserify and made my mistake with `react/addons`. This lead me to a wild set of hypotheses as to why it wasn't working, such as assuming it might be due to a regression in React 0.12 (since it's been migrating from `React.renderComponent` to `React.render` and I thought `CSSTransitionGroup` might have been lagging behind), to thinking it could be a problem with `CSSTransitionGroup` itself.\n\nThe reason why I raise this issue is that, since passing an `undefined` type won't work anyway, it would make sense if React could check for `undefined` and warn about it or maybe even raise an exception (since it would crash soon after anyway). \n\nMy instance was a bit more extreme and if something like this happens to someone else they'll probably know where they screwed up in the first place, but some help from React would always be welcome!\n",
