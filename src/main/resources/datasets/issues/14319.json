  "body": "TL;DR: Can you expose [shared/getComponentName](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/shared/getComponentName.js)?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\r\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nExpose an API to get the display name of every component (in `__DEV__` only).\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nMost of the ecosystem still uses `Component.displayName || Component.name || someFallbackName` \r\n (with some branching depending on the type of `Component`) when setting the display name of an enhanced component i.e. `connect()(WrappedComponent)` will result in `\"connect(WrappedComponent)\"` as a `displayName`.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nSince components created by `forwardRef` or `memo` are not actual functions these higher-order components are not able to determine a proper display name while `react-devtools` is able to:\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/zqj9v50243\r\n\r\n- `react-redux` creates `\"connect(Component)\"`\r\n- `react-router` creates `\"withRouter(undefined)\"`\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe new \"exotic-components\" should work with the existing 3rd party libraries WRT to `displayName`.\r\n\r\nNow there are a couple of solutions to this issue:\r\n1. **Edit:** Expose [shared/getComponentName](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/shared/getComponentName.js)\r\n2. This is the responsibility of the ecosystem. It should provide a solution and maintain it. Somewhat blocked by #12882, related: #12932\r\n3. Grant access to the functionality used in `react-devtools` (or would this only work on the fibers?)\r\n4. Set a `name` (or `displayName` no preference here) property on those \"exotic-components\" (don't know how to call them). Naive implementation e.g.: `name: 'ForwardRef(' + fn.name + ')'`.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nI guess this started with `forwardRef` in 16.3.\r\n",
