  "body": "_Note: I asked this on SO first, but was directed here._\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Did the massive overhaul of react-addons-perf make a large change that would cause wildly different results on the same data using Perf.getInclusive?\r\n\r\nWe are in the process of upgrading from React 15.0.2 to React 15.4.2 and we are seeing some puzzling changes when profiling using react-perf-addons. Our test case is a table with 200 rows and 2200 cells.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading we tested total render times using Window.performance and using react-addons-perf’s getLastMeasurment.duration. Both of these tools show a 10% – 15% increase in performance when rendering the table; this does not seem outside of the realm of possibility.\r\n\r\nThings started to get weird when we looked at the results from Perf.printInclusive. The results from printInclusive (for each individual component render) report that they render faster by a factor of 5 and this does not seem to jive with what we are seeing elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI tried to look at the changes inside the ReactPerf.js module but this file was replaced wholesale so it is hard to understand what may have changed and nothing in the changelog would really explain this big of difference in the results from printInclusive.\r\n\r\nMy question is, could these grossly different findings from Perf.printInclusive be explained by the big refactor on react-addons-perf? Is this function showing something different from what it used to show? Were the old numbers wrong?",
