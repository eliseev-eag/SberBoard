  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nfeature\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nshouldComponentUpdate for functional components feature is already implemented in fiber alpha release. But in comment it is written that it will be removed in final release. \r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nAllow optional shouldComponentUpdate property for functional component.\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? \r\nReact v16\r\n\r\nDid this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nNo\r\n\r\nToday, I was planning to add shouldComponentUpdate property for functional component and open a issue on GitHub for adding shouldComponentUpdate and send a patch for it. But I saw shouldComponentUpdate is already implemented for functional components.\r\n\r\nBut there is comment written in code that\r\n// TODO: Disable this before release, since it is not part of the public API\r\n// I use this for testing to compare the relative overhead of classes.\r\n      if (typeof fn.shouldComponentUpdate === 'function' && !fn.shouldComponentUpdate(memoizedProps, nextProps)) {\r\n}\r\n\r\nI think this is very useful feature and should be part of the public API. We don't need to use class based Pure component. Any idea why this is not going to final release?\r\n![shouldcomponentupdate](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25106899/25362915/633eddc2-2974-11e7-9534-d15bd28c5889.png)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",
