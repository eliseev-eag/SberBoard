It is also not a super big problem, as far as I see it. \r\n\r\nI would be happy to look into it, if this was confirmed as a bug, though :)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI expected React to leave a white space between my text even if I break a line before an inline element (in my example a `<strong>`). In this case I would have to remove my line break for it to work. \r\n\r\nTo illustrate, this works fine:\r\n```\r\nexport default () => (\r\n  <p>\r\n    foo <strong>bar</strong>\r\n  </p>\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, when I checked in the console, I see the DOM created by React indeed trims out white spaces from the begining and the end of my string. The `nodeValue` for the `foo` text node in React is just that `nodeValue: \"foo\"` and in pureHTML it is `nodeValue: \"\\n    foo\\n    \"`.\r\n\r\nI should note that even if I add a space before the line break, it is still trimmed.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI don't know if this used to work, but currently I'm using MacOS Mojave, I have tested this in Firefox 67 and Chrome 72 and my React version is 16.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_Sorry for the clumsy bug report, hope this helps._\r\n\r\n:)\r\n",
