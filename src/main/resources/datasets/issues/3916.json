  "body": "My team is working on a project were sometimes we inject more than one React application into a page.  We recently noticed that the onClick handler specified for one of the applications was also getting applied to the node with the same data-reactid in the other application.  Is there a way to force the root component to use a data-reactid other than .0 so that each react application is sort of namespaced?\n\n  We're using v0.11.2\n",
