  "body": "I would like to report a bug.\r\n\r\nCurrently in certain cases (like the one reproduced below) critical error messages are not displayed in the developer console. Sometimes the view does not render at all and it's left to our guesswork to identify the culprit.\r\n\r\nHere's the relevant jsfiddle: \r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/b1co3uex/10/\r\n\r\nYou can see that the only error being thrown is the one deliberately put in line 6. It blocks proper rendering of the view, yet no trace of it is show in the developer console.\r\n\r\nThe expected behaviour would be to catch the error and show it in developer console.\r\n\r\nMy current workaround is to wrap `setState` calls in `try/catch`, which is ugly - but it works. \r\n\r\nI suppose this is not by design, as React usually has excellent error reporting capabilities. \r\n\r\nI am aware that the issue might be caused by imperfections in my code. If there's a way to improve it while maintaining its functionality, I'm all ears :)\r\n\r\nI've been struggling with this issue for quite some time now. In the above jsfiddle you can see the error being reproduced in React 15.3.2.\r\n",
