If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!\n3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.\n4. Ensure the test suite passes (`grunt test`).\n5. Make sure your code lints (`grunt lint`) - we've done our best to make sure these rules match our internal linting guidelines.\n6. If you haven't already, complete the [CLA](https://code.facebook.com/cla).\n\nReturning false ensures that the page does not reload when one of the input fields is empty. Consequently, this prevents form data from being cleared on page reload.\n",
