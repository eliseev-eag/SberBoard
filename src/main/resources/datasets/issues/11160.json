Did you mean `charSet`?\r\n    in meta (at head.js:39)\r\n    in head (at head.js:35)\r\n    in Head (created by Connect(Head))\r\n    in Connect(Head) (at root_container.js:14)\r\n    in html (at root_container.js:13)\r\n    in Router (created by ConnectedRouter)\r\n    in ConnectedRouter (at root_container.js:12)\r\n    in Provider (at root_container.js:11)\r\n    in Root (at index.js:95)`\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd when we change it to `charSet` it renders the camelcased version. We should remove this warning.\r\n\r\nIt also happens with srcSet, httpEquiv etc. \r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template for React 16: https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/, template for React 15: https://jsfiddle.net/hmbg7e9w/).**\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/5uoLz1Lz/1/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nNo warning should be given. \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nIn previous versions of React, we passed in the camelcase and it rendered the case correctly either snake or lowercase. Now it renders the camelcase when this is executed on the server.  \r\n\r\nWe are using React v16, happening in latest Chrome. \r\n",
