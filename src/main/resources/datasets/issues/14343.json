However, it may be a false positive when `throw` is being used to assert a component is being used correctly.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport function ComponentUsingReduxContext() {\r\n  const redux = React.useContext(ReactReduxContext)\r\n  if (redux === null) {\r\n    throw new Error('ComponentUsingReduxContext mounted outside a redux Provider')\r\n  }\r\n  // more validation, initializing, etc\r\n  // ...\r\n  // causes a lint warning\r\n  React.useEffect(() => {})\r\n\r\n  return null\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n`throw new Error`, or at least one where the `Identifier`'s `name` `.endsWith('Error')`, could be considered an exception to the \"no early returns\" rule as the component will never try to reuse the state from the current render.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when you suspend by throwing a `Promise`, you also lose your state, so arguably all `throw`s could be ignored, but I see that more as a bug with suspending than intended behavior.\r\n",
