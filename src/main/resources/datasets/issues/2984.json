  "body": "The doc makes it clear that we can use cloneWithProps and pass ref in extraProps to override the ref : http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/clone-with-props.html\nBut when doing so, we get a warning : \n\n``` jsx\nvar myComponent = <MyComponent ref=\"myref\"></MyComponent>\nvar myClone = React.addons.cloneWithProps(myComponent, {ref: 'mycloneref'});\n```\n\n```\nWarning: You are calling cloneWithProps() on a child with a ref. This is dangerous because you're creating a new child which will not be added as a ref to its parent.\n```\n\nShould not we get no warning in that specific case ?\n\nOtherwise, is there a way to set the ref on myComponent after it has been created ?\n",
