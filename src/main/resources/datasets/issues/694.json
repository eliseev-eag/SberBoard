  "body": "In IE9, when you use a button to trigger an event that deletes an element (containing that button), everything works as expected. However, if this event is an item in a list of similar elements, clicking the buttons in each element in quick succession triggers an error in this function:\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/8b0af9b5de47e48d9dfd793219a40fa0f39efaa9/src/eventPlugins/SelectEventPlugin.js#L66\n\nThe error is:\n\n```\n\"Invalid operand to 'in': Object expected\".\n```\n\nUsing IE9's debugging tools I've been able to discover that in this situation, the `node` argument is null. I can't work out if there is a problem with React's DOM representation, but can confirm that this is only a problem when you make multiple clicks within a few hundred milliseconds of each other. Taking your time doesn't trigger the error.\n\nHere's the website I'm getting this error on: http://colin-gourlay.com/25headlines. Try adding a few items, then removing them by clicking the X.\n\nI'd submit a pull request that extends the condition in L66 to ensure node is an object, but I don't know enough about the overall architecture to know if the else blocks you currently have can handle this case, or if another is needed.\n",
