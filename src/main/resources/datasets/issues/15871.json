  "body": "This PR aims at fixed a bunch of bugs with iOS in `Press`. Notably: ensuring the responder region is correctly adhered to and also accounting for multiple presses for all browsers. There have also been numerous small performance optimizations and now the runtime of a press to the `onPress` firing is around 20% less.\r\n\r\nAnother area I've tackled is the behaviour of pointer events. Previously, we used to fully leverage pointer events, but this ended up not being what we really wanted. `pointercancel` fires too frequently in most cases and makes for a detached user-experience when \"touching\" the UI compared to native \"touching\". We now switch to using `touchstart`, `touchmove` and `touchend` again, with `pointerType` co-ordination so we don't lose the pointer types.\r\n\r\nI've also added basic support for `trackpad` pointer events. More testing is needed for this on iOS 13 though.\r\n\r\nDemo URL: https://bxlrc.codesandbox.io/",
