  "body": "### (Based on top of #11580)\r\n\r\nThe existing separation between the BeginWork module and the ClassComponent module is awkward. There's some redundant code and over-abstraction that is eliminated by colocating class component logic with the same logic for other types of work. Specifically: anything related to bailouts or reconciliation should be in BeginWork.\r\n\r\nLifecycle-related code is kept in the separate module, since it's unique to class components. In a future WASM implementation, this would be the boundary between the reconciler and JS.\r\n\r\nThis will make future refactors of the begin phase easier since all the code is in the same place.",
