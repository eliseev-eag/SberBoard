  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nReport a  bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIn Chrome, when typing a sharp S (ß, a German letter) in an input field with `type=\"email\"`, it converts the `ß` to `ss` (~~expected~~ unexpected behaviour) and the cursor jumps back to the beginning of the input field (unexpected behaviour). This does only happen if the `ß` is part of the domain.\r\nTrying to type `test@testß.de` will end as `.detest@testss`:\r\n![Example](https://i.imgur.com/SWQ0p4f.gif)\r\n\r\nIt can be tested with the latest Google Chrome: \r\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/MzzEqB\r\nIf you don't have a `ß` on your keyboard, you can reproduce the bug by just Copy&Pasting it.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nTested with Chrome Version 70.0.3538.110 (Official Build) (64-bit) on Ubuntu 18.04 and React 16.6.3\r\n\r\nIn Firefox, this does not happen, as it does not convert `ß` to `ss`. I didn't test other browsers.",
