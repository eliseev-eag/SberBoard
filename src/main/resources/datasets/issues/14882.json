Perhaps context is changing. But my biggest frustrations lately have been due to renders happening when they shouldn't, or seem like they shouldn't.\r\n\r\nFor example I can have a component like so:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst Component = React.memo(() => <div />, (a, b) => true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I'll find it calling render quite often in a performance sensitive area.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful to have docs somewhere that really go into why a component render is being called.\r\n\r\nFurther, it would be even more helpful to have a sort of \"debug stream\" you could hook into to see React logging reasons why things are updated in a clean fashion. That this doesn't exist already is a bit of a mystery. It would have saved a ridiculous amount of time for myself over the last years, and I'm sure many others. It would look something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(render) ComponentName [props changed]\r\n(render) OtherComponentName [props changed] [state changed]\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven better would be to show some sort of tree structure. And show the results of memo/shouldComponentUpdate, and why they may have been ignored:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(render) ComponentName [memo: true | ignored due to context change in: SomeContext] \r\n```\r\n",
