  "body": "This PR moves around some parts and refactors the event responder system to cater for event responders having new lifecycle events (to be added in a follow up PR). The big difference is that `handleEvent` -> `onEvent` and it now has another argument, `event`.\r\n\r\nI had feedback that it was confusing why the `context` object had so many concerns, so that's been taken care of now â€“ it only deals with the context of the responder dealing with events, the actual event properties are in the `event` object.\r\n\r\nI've also cleaned up and removed all the `prototype` methods and instead opted for static methods and using closures.\r\n\r\nRef #15257",
