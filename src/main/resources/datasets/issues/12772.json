  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nbug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe TestUtils' `Simulate` module in React 16 doesn't immediately flush updates to the DOM like it used to in version 15 and previous.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nI made a gist with 2 ready-to-go HTML files: https://gist.github.com/mjackson/9318e71a912633c9ec97d23f3189d3d4\r\n\r\nJust open either one in a browser.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen behavior is triggered via the `Simulate` module, state should be flushed to the DOM immediately so assertions may be made on the next line.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16 is affected by this issue. Yes, this used to work. In version 15.6.2 (and previous) you could `Simulate.click` and then immediately assert on the next line that changes had been flushed to the DOM.\r\n\r\nI searched through the React tests for some test that was actually making this style of assertion (that updates were actually being flushed to the DOM) but couldn't find anything.",
