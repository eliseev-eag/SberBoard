  "body": "This PR aims to address issues around using screen reader tooling (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS) with the `Press` event responder. We previously relied on \"press\" events firing when coming from a valid pointer/mouse/touch sequence of events. We also supported \"Enter\" and \"Space\" keyboard events. However, we did not take into account that screen reader tooling can also fire virtual `click` events to specific DOM nodes.\r\n\r\nScreen reader virtual click events have a pattern that makes them somewhat easy to detect. They seem to also have `0` as the `nativeEvent.detail`, rather than `1` and they also never provide screen co-ordinates (they are all always `0`).\r\n\r\nTesting URL: https://m9zxnyvpj9.csb.app/",
