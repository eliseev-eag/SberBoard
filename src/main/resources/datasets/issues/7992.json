  "body": "This builds on top of #7941 and adds basic support for setting DOM attributes.\nCommit for review: 5a5bb86d1a6f59be61c5f9c54d00e208a99053c5.\n\nTest plan: `examples/fiber/index.html` now can put `className` on a `div`:\n\n<img width=\"228\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-10-17 at 19 24 18\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/810438/19450334/eabe262c-94a0-11e6-8c16-155bb98c2c44.png\">\n\n`examples/basic/index.html` still works both with regular and minified builds.\n\nThere were a couple of issues:\n- I needed `DOMProperty` so I had to inject `ReactDefaultInjection` which brought a bunch of the non-Fiber renderer into the Fiber build. I don't see a simpler workaround right now because we want to keep tests that test `ReactDOMFiber` alongside non-Fibery `ReactDOMServer`. Those are tricky to fix if we let both `ReactDOMFiber` and `ReactDOMServer` inject their own stuff independently. Another plausible option is to completely fork the files but it seemed excessive.\n- I had to decouple `DOMPropertyOperations` from `ReactDOMComponentTree` so I added an explicit `debugID` argument to all methods.\n\nThis PR does include not support for events, web components, or style attribute. I figured I wouldn't waste time on this unless we agreed the approach is correct.\n\nFiber before this PR:\n\n```\nTest Suites: 73 failed, 46 passed, 119 total\nTests:       712 failed, 3 skipped, 736 passed, 1451 total\n```\n\nFiber after this PR:\n\n```\nTest Suites: 73 failed, 46 passed, 119 total\nTests:       690 failed, 3 skipped, 758 passed, 1451 total\n```\n",
