  "body": "Currently `createPortal` only works within the current renderer.\r\n\r\nThis means that if you want to embed one renderer into another (e.g. `react-art` in `react-dom`), your only option is to do an imperative render in a commit-time hook like `componentDidMount` or `componentDidUpdate` of the outer renderer's component. In fact that's exactly how `react-art` works today.\r\n\r\nWith this approach, nested renderers like `react-art` can't read the context of the outer renderers (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12796). Similarly, we can't time-slice updates in inner renderers because we only update the inner container at the host renderer's commit time.\r\n\r\nAt the time we originally discussed portals we wanted to make them work across renderers. So that you could do something like\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<div>\r\n  <Portal to={ReactART}>\r\n    <surface>\r\n      <rect />\r\n    </surface>\r\n  </Portal>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it's not super clear how this should work because renderers can bundle incompatible Fiber implementations. Whose implementation takes charge?\r\n\r\nWe'll want to figure something out eventually. For now I'm filing this for future reference.",
