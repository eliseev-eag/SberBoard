  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nReport a bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen using a number input that has a defaultValue, you cannot enter a decimal value. When attempting to type a decimal, the cursor is moved to the beginning of the input. This behavior is *not* observed when there is no defaultValue given.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/zc0x3egz/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe input should allow you to type a decimal.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nThis is happening with React 15.3.2. It does *not* happen in 0.14.x",
