  "body": "I have components which I route to using react router dom. I am deploying this application to a existing PHP application and created some links inside of the application that point to the same domain but at a path where the external PHP application lives. When a link is clicked the navigation takes the user to a page that is obviously still inside of the React application. \r\n\r\nI would assume that I should be able to navigate outside of the React application even though I am on the same domain as it so I assume React removing my ability to do so is a bug. \r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\"react\": \"^16.1.0\",\r\n\"react-router-dom\": \"^4.2.2\",\r\n\r\n## Test Case\r\nI am deploying a react application to be part of a existing website. In some cases I need to navigate my users outside of the react application but keep them inside of the domain. \r\n\r\nFor example if I am using React Router Dom in my app and I try to do this, \r\n\r\n```\r\n<a role=\"button\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.example.com/login.php//\">\r\nLogin\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n```\r\nor this, \r\n\r\n```\r\n<a role=\"button\" onClick={() => (window.location = 'https://www.example.com/financial-products.html/')}>\r\n Financial Products\r\n</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate react project, and create a link that navigates to a component in the React application. Then make a link that navigates to a php page outside of the react application but in the same domain. \r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe link should navigate to the correct page which is not inside of the React application.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe app navigates to a blank react page only showing the header and footer. In other words it will not leave the react application. ",
