  "body": "_Apologies if this is documented somewhere, but I was unable to find anything related after a pretty exhaustive search of docs + code._\r\n\r\nAre there any production instrumentation hooks for the reconciler?  Specifically, I'm looking for callbacks/events that would allow me to track overall reconciliation time spans (nothing more granular).  E.g. equivalent to the `(React Tree Reconciliation)` span.\r\n\r\nAs best I can tell, there are `performance.timings` spans reported as of Fiber (and `ReactPerf` prior), but those are only enabled in development mode.",
