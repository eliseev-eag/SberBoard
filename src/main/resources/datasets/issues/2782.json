  "body": "So my understanding from #2781 is that there is no legitimate reason for JSX to prohibit JavaScript keywords, and for the same reasons there is no reason to require camelCase attributes.\n\nThis appears to be an oversight on the part of the original authors.\n\nAs far as fixing this goes, the concern expressed appears to be backwards compatibility. As far as I can tell, there doesn't seem to be any reason why someone couldn't submit a PR that is fully backwards compatible with today's JSX, and allows coders and designers to use HTML naturally (something that could be a major boon to the project as well).\n\nWithin 30 minutes of opening issue #2781 two people (@antoinegrant and @akiran) :+1:'d it.\n\nIt seems like something many people want, myself included. For me, also, whether or not this is allowed to be fixed indicates the health of project. Something is very obviously broken and people are being asked to jump through unnatural hoops for absolutely no reason.\n\nIf that's not enough reason to fix something in React then why should anyone continue to recommend the project?\n\nTo the group members and project admins, I just ask that you give this issue some honest thought for at least 5 minutes before hitting the close button. And if you still decide to close the issue, please let the community know your reasoning so we can understand why.\n\nThank you,\nGreg Slepak\n",
