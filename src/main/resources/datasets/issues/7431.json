  "body": "This is the first day I've used `react-test-renderer`, and I've already stumbled upon three problems:\n- The injectEnvironment called twice bug #7386 \n- The fact that refs is just `null` when rendered with `react-test-renderer` #7371\n- When setting a ref on a dom element, React erroneously warns about stateless function components cannot be given refs. (also probably related to #7371)\n\n`react-test-renderer` is going to be shipped with `create-react-app` very soon (?) (it's in `react-test-renderer@0.3.0-alpha`), so I think it deserves some more comprehensive documentation as soon as possible. With at least some troubleshooting bulletpoints and some text about how one are supposed to do with refs.\n\nI sometimes use refs from `componentDidMount`. For example for setting focus on an input `this.refs.input.focus()`. But such code will fail with `cannot call focus() on undefined`. Should we always test if a ref isn't undefined before using them? Or do you have some plans for `react-test-renderer` in near future that will solve this issue in some way? \n",
