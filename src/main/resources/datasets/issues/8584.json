  "body": "Use an UpdateQueue for top-level updates (`ReactDOM.render`), rather than mutate the pending props directly, which effectively overrides the previous update.\r\n\r\nThis uncovered an inconsistency in Stack related to top-level callbacks. I'll fix that in a separate PR.\r\n\r\nBased on and blocked by https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8538.\r\n\r\n@gaearon, I removed some of the tests in `ReactIncrementalScheduling-test.js` in favor of tests in both `ReactIncremental-test.js` and `ReactIncrementalUpdates-test.js` which (if I'm correct) cover the same things. If I've deleted a test for a case you feel is no longer covered, let me know and I'll write a new one. My goal was only to reduce noise in the test suite, not to stop testing specific cases.",
