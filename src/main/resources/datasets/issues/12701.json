Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nyou can create DOM nodes in memory before appending them to the DOM, so I'd expect react to create the elements necessary in memory before appending to the mount point of ReactDOM.render\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nNo",
