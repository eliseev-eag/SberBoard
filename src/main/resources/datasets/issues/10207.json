  "body": "Fixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10196.\r\nSee individual commits for descriptions of how this got broken, and why this fix works.\r\n\r\n**This is a minimal fix to unbreak master.**\r\n\r\nFollow-up items (**not part of this PR**) that @jquense and I will look into:\r\n\r\n* Remove lazy tracker path from `updateValueIfChanged`. It isn’t useful, and makes code more complicated. It is easier if we can assume that tracker is always exists while component is mounted.\r\n\r\n* Simplify the wild polymorphism. This method accepts a fiber, a Stack instance, and a DOM node. Stack will be gone soon, so we should look into either making it always accept a DOM node, or maybe making it always accept a fiber.\r\n\r\n* Related: reduce the abstraction in naming. I think #10156 made things slightly more confusing by calling argument a “subject” and we lost track of what it means. Let’s be explicit and precise about what exactly it is, and try to use Flow with less `any`s here.",
