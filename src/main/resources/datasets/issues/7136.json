  "body": " I wanted to drop my string-based refs bindings and replace them with callback-based ones, however, when I tried to replace `ref=\"email\"` with `ref={ (ref) => this.refs.email = ref }`, I received an error: `TypeError: Can't add property email, object is not extensible`.\n\nI didn't find any informations about this in docs, but I found other [issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4934) in which @frederickfogerty did what I tried to do: `ref={ c => this.refs['wrapper'] = c }`\n\n... and I assume that back in 22 Sep 2015 it worked, now it doesn't. Did something change and refs object became nonextensible? Is assigning refs manually through callbacks to `this.refs` considered a bad practice now?\n",
