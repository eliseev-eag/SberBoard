  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nReport a bug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe `ResponderEventPlugin` no longer recognizes start DOM events.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\r\n\r\nThe `EventPluginUtils.isStartish` helper only checks for mouse/touch start events. [In this section of code](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/2f8d1689db30a769188f08b79480a1301b736d6f/src/renderers/shared/shared/event/eventPlugins/ResponderEventPlugin.js#L318-L325), the `topLevelType` used to be only `topMouseDown` or `topTouchStart` in React 15.3, but is now `topClick` in React 15.4.0. This means the event plugin can no longer recognize start events.\r\n\r\nThis PR exposes the issue in `react-native-web`, which uses the `ResponderEventPlugin`: https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/pull/255\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe same behaviour as exhibited with React 15.3.2.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nWorks in React 15.3.2. Doesn't work in React 15.4.0.",
