  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIf you double click a contentEditable span with a single word in it followed by another span (not editable) with more text, the entire contentEditable will not be selected (as it should be, since it's a single word). Instead, only the part of the text to the left of the cursor will be selected.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/310901/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIt selects the full word.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.4.1",
