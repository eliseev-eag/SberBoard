  "body": "Hi everyone, I have currently facing a problem with provider (from unstated lib) and input.\r\nIn our project, we have to share inputs values between several components, so we have created a provider (with unstated lib) that contains the values. The values are passing as props into SearchForm component thanks to withSearchFields function.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThe problem is, each time we want to update the value at any position, the cursor jumps to the end of the input.\r\n\r\nI have simplified our code and add it in CodeSandbox : https://codesandbox.io/s/n2w9xv090\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe cursor doesn't go to the end.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React ?** 16.8.6\r\n\r\nCould you help us to understand what's going on please ? I think the problem comes from the props injection by the provider.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help ! \r\n![bitmoji](https://render.bitstrips.com/v2/cpanel/359644fb-c5df-4412-9bc7-ae838696ef14-2f2df822-b107-45d5-a129-564123b6c4ca-v1.png?transparent=1&palette=1&width=246)\r\n",
