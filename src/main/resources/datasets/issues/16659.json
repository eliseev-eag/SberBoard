  "body": "The Scheduler module in www is loaded before most of our other infra: too early to conditionally load a separate build in production versus development. Which means we're currently sending both a prod and dev bundle to every single user.\r\n\r\nWe should fix this on the Facebook infra side, but in the meantime, this updates the build script to generate a new type of bundle, `FB_WWW_COMBINED`, which preserves __DEV__ conditions.",
