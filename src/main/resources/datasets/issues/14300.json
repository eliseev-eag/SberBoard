  "body": "I'd like to modify some of the inner workings of the `ReactDOM` implementation with some auxiliary info. That being said, instead of writing a custom renderer from scratch that mimics all of ReactDOM, I'm thinking of simply extending it by patching/stubbing/etc. the functions I need to augment.\r\n\r\nAny advice on how to do this? When I import `ReactDOM`, only a few functions are exposed (e.g. `render`), but I need access to many of the inner methods of the `hostConfig`, such as `createInstance`, `appendChild`, `commitUpdate`, etc.\r\n\r\nThanks, in advance, for the guidance!",
