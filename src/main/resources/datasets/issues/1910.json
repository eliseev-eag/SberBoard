  "body": "During updating of some code from react 0.10 to 0.11, I ran into something that took some time to track down. The root issue is that 0.10 used console.warn for custom propTypes validation usually, 0.11 wants an error to be returned. This doesn't appear to be documented as part of the 0.11 docs.\n\nThe changes in 0.11 also appear to have an additional side-effect, propTypes appear to be initialised multiple times, see this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/2TPZZ/1/ (turn on your console and run). It's a bit contrived, but it is an excerpt of a dynamic form generator - hence the multiple mixins.\n\nThe interesting thing to note is that the testProperty: function(props, propName, componentName) { validator logs twice, once without testProperty, which fails validation, and then again but this time with testProperty in props. My original code (0.10) had console.warn there, which meant that the second run of the validator never happened, resulting in a property not being set. I suspect something in 0.11 catches the error, and retries validation with a different setup.\n\nIt's not clear to me what the intended behaviour is, but the fiddle seems to be a good test case to start tracking this down.\n",
