This came to mind after experiencing some of the issues in #14110. There may be other potential use cases too \r\n\r\n**Example of current behavior**\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst Avatar = () => {\r\n  const [src] = useSomeGlobalState([\r\n    state => state.user.avatar.src\r\n  ]);\r\n  return useMemo(() => <img src={src} />, [src])\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Example of proposed behavior**\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst Avatar = () => \r\n  useMemo(\r\n    (src) => <img src={src} />,\r\n    useSomeGlobalState([state => state.user.avatar.src])\r\n  );\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.8.1\r\n",
