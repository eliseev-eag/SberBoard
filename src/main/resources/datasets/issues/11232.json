  "body": "Adds the ability to start rendering work without flushing the changes to the screen, by blocking the commit phase. This can be used to coordinate React's commit phase with other async work.\r\n\r\n- `root.prerender` schedules an update and returns a work object.\r\n- `work.commit` unblocks the commit phase and flushes the remaining\r\n  work synchronously.\r\n\r\n(Not yet implemented is `work.then`, which schedules a callback that fires once the work has completed. To keep these PRs focused, I'll do this in a follow-up.)",
