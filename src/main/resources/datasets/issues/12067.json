In my tests I find that button, simulate a click on it but none of the inputs are reset.\r\n\r\n**Reproduction**\r\nSee here https://jsfiddle.net/2854yewm/\r\nComponent above shows how it should be, but the test shows the expected behaviour doesn't occur.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nSimulated click on the reset button causes the inputs in the form to be reset.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact and ReactDOM 16.2.0, testing with Jest 21.2.1 \r\n",
