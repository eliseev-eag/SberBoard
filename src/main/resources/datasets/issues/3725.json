  "body": "The [ES6 support announcement](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/01/27/react-v0.13.0-beta-1.html) says:\n\n> the idiomatic way to specify class state is to just use a simple instance property. Likewise getDefaultProps and propTypes are really just properties on the constructor.\n\nThis makes a lot of sense to me, but I noticed some small inconsistencies that may be worth rethinking.\n\nWhen using the original `.createClass` syntax, the value returned by `getDefaultProps` seems to be used at other points in the component lifecycle -- not just in the constructor. For example, if I inspect what gets sent to `componentWillReceiveProps(props)`, I can see that the default props are applied.\n\nThis _doesn't_ seem to be the case when using the ES6 class syntax, which means I have to duplicate code. Here's an example of what I mean:\n\n``` js\nclass Control extends React.Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n    props.value = props.value || '';\n    super(props);\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n  componentWillReceiveProps(props) {\n    props.value = props.value || '';\n    // Do something with props...\n  }\n\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, I'm duplicating the expression `props.value = props.value || ''`. If I had more than one default, I'd obviously have a lot more duplication.\n\nWhen using the `.createClass` method, I could return `{value: ''}` from the `getDefaultProps` method, and this would work, and I'd only have to do it once.\n\nDoes it make sense to restore this method to avoid unnecessary duplication? Is there another, more React-like approach that I'm not aware of?\n",
