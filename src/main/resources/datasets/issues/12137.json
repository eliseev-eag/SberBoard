  "body": "<!--\r\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\r\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIt is possible to modify the state of a parent component through child props if the prop is an array or object. This seems to be a byproduct of the fact that javascript passes arrays/objects into functions by reference instead of by value. \r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nI have shown what I mean in [this codepen](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/OQyGRz). \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nYou should not be able to modify parent state in a child component through props, since props are normally assumed to be immutable. It is easy to prevent this behavior by doing a deep clone of array/object before it is passed in as a prop. Just do a `slice()` on the value array in my example to see what I mean. \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI've tried React 15.6.1 and 16.2.0.\r\n",
