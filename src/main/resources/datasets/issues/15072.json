  "body": "## Based on #15071\r\n\r\n*Refer to the base PR for more context*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis compiles normal error constructors (`new Error(...)` and `Error(...)`) to `ReactError` in and `ReactErrorProd`, adding support to our error code replacement infra.\r\n\r\nIt also adds a lint rule to enforce that error messages are written in an extraction-friendly format.\r\n\r\nError messages must be a concatenation of strings and string literals. This is partly an artificial restriction, because I could generate a template string even from a dynamic expression, but requiring the use of a template literal for dynamic values helps prevent mistakes like `const msg = 'string'; throw new Error(msg)`.\r\n\r\nYou can add `extract-error/skip` to messages that don't need to be replaced with an error code.",
