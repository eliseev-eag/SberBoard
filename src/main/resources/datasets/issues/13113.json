Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nExample: https://codesandbox.io/s/nr75vkklnm\r\n\r\n> You will either need to be on touch device, or enable touch sensors in your browser to see this\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\n1. add a `onTouchStart` listener to a component\r\n2. in response to `onTouchStart` move the component into a Portal\r\n3. touchmove events and the touchend events are then blocked for the rest of the touch interaction\r\n\r\nIf the component is already in a component before the touchstart event then the events are emitted correctly: https://codesandbox.io/s/v54x54vp5\r\n\r\nI have also created a vanilla js example that has a portal implementation. It moves the element into a portal after touch start. It is correctly allowing touch touchmove and touchend events: https://codesandbox.io/s/r4mn0yj6po\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThat the touchmove and touchend events are published\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReproduced bug in Firefox and Chrome\r\n\r\nReact version: tested on 16.1, 16.3 and 16.4.1",
