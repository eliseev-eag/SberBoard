  "body": "These mocks are things we expect to be available in the React Native environment. I'd like to move them out of the renderer folder so that we can sync that folder to React Native as is without overriding its mocks.\r\n\r\nI motivate by the fact that they're not really part of the renderer code itself. I leave the ReactNative mock since that is in fact part of the renderer.",
