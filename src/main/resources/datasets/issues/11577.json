  "body": "I originally thought this issue was just around using `<input type='number' />` but upon digging further it appeared that Safari just plain doesn't like controlled inputs: whatever you type, will appear in that input.\r\n\r\nYou can see this in action here: http://jsbin.com/voyigef/edit?html,js,output\r\n\r\nNow, I will say that we worked around this for the time being by leveraging `onKeyPress` instead of `onChange`, which allowed us to stop the event propagation.\r\n\r\nWe're all on Safari 11.0.1 so I'm not sure if this only affects Safari 11. From looking at older issues, it looks like this is a solved problem for Safari 10.x but I don't have it so I can't confirm that or not.",
