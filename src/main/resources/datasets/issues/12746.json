  "body": "NOTE: We still need a way to test the timing out of callbacks, probably with some type of injection we we could create a 'noopSchedule' similar to 'noopRenderer'.\r\n\r\nI'm going to go back and implement that as a 2/n PR, but wanted review of this because it's the direction I would ideally take after that.\r\n\r\nThis PR would be followed by a PR to add error handling.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n    Support multiple callbacks in `ReactScheduler`\r\n    \r\n    **what is the change?:**\r\n    We keep a queue of callbacks instead of just one at a time, and call\r\n    them in order first by their timeoutTime and then by the order which\r\n    they were scheduled in.\r\n    \r\n    **why make this change?:**\r\n    We plan on using this module to coordinate JS outside of React, so we\r\n    will need to schedule more than one callback at a time.\r\n    \r\n    **test plan:**\r\n    Added a boatload of shiny new tests. :)\r\n    \r\n    Plus ran all the old ones.",
