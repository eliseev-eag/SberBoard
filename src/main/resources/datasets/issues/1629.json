  "body": "I was browsing the code of http://fb.me/react-0.10.0.js\n\nand saw a lot of code like: `\"production\" !== \"development\"` which is basically dead code.\n\nThis is not a major issue but it could help to optimise the size of the output standalone library and remove out the definitely dead code.\n\nI have no knowledge of how you manage your source code but it sounds like you should do `#if` instead of `#define` preprocess approach?\n",
