  "body": "\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nfeature , question ?\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\ncomponentDidCatch is not triggered when the error occurred  on event handlers in react components \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nto be honest , without reading the full documentation about error boundaries , my first attempt to test error boundaries was to trigger an error in an event handler (ouch!) , then i discovered that componentDidCatch is triggered only on react lifecycle methods and render  . I'm wondering why this design decision has been done like that ? it would be convenient to have only one component that handle all unexpected exceptions inside our components , instead now we should have two ways to handle errors inside the component.\r\nI have also created an stackoverflow question : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47020422/why-reactjs-error-boundaries-are-not-triggered-on-event-handlers with the same concern.\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\"react\": \"^16.0.0\"",
