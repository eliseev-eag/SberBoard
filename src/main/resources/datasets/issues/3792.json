  "body": "My co-worker and I were caught off-guard by this behaviour yesterday, and I wanted to see if this is a possible React bug or some misunderstanding on our part.\n\nBasically it seems having more than one part to the innerhtml of an option element and then trying to update one of them will throw the error:\n\n```\n\"Uncaught Error: Invariant Violation: findComponentRoot(..., .0.1.$0.0): Unable to find element.\nThis probably means the DOM was unexpectedly mutated (e.g., by the browser), usually due to forgetting a <tbody> when using tables, nesting tags like <form>, <p>, or <a>, or using non-SVG elements in an <svg> parent.\nTry inspecting the child nodes of the element with React ID ``.\"\n```\n\nWe have worked around it by combining the parts into a single variable and then using that.\n\nHere is the jsfiddle demonstrating the error: http://jsfiddle.net/johnarnold212675186/14te87oy/\nHere is what we've done as a workaround: http://jsfiddle.net/johnarnold212675186/zqgjjwaL/\n\nAm I doing something wrong, or is this something that should be possible with React?\n",
