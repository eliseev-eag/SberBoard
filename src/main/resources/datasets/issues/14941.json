There's already a good entry point for a solution to this problem in\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/c11015ff4f610ac2924d1fc6d569a17657a404fd/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/src/RulesOfHooks.js#L18https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/c11015ff4f610ac2924d1fc6d569a17657a404fd/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/src/RulesOfHooks.js#L18 \r\n\r\nThe simplest implementation would allow for a custom regex but I fear that people abuse this until it's very hard to recognize what a custom hook is and what not. Allowing a prefix would solve this particular use case. Maybe as opinionated as `/^${prefix}_use[A-Z0-9].*$/`.\r\n\r\n`useUnstableMediaQuery` is not a good solution IMO since it implies that the media query is unstable. Same for `Unstable_useMediaQuery`. This is pretty hacky since the linter considers this a component. React has already set precedent with prefixing experimental features with `unstable_` so this naming pattern is not that exotic.\r\n\r\nHappy to work on a PR.\r\n",
