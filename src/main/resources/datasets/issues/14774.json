  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nReport a bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\n`react-test-renderer` emits a warning to wrap code inside `act` even though it is.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nHere is a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/wwopxr137k?expanddevtools=1&previewwindow=tests) with a component using `useState` that toggles a div on/off on a button click. The test finds the button, calls the `onClick` on the props. This would be followed by a snapshot test. However, no matter how I try and wrap the code in `act`, the warning persists.\r\n\r\nMake sure to open the tests tab on the right, and to expand the console at the bottom:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/433409/52360399-ac50bf00-2a1a-11e9-9cf1-ba34b642102f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThere should be no warning.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nreact@16.8\r\nreact-dom@16.8\r\nreact-test-renderer@16.8\r\njest@24.1.0\r\n\r\nThis worked fine with react*@16.7.0-alpha.2, snapshot and all.",
