  "body": "Related https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5134 and https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5311.\n\nIn upgrading to React 0.14.2 today, I found that methods for rendering static markup aren't available as UMD artifacts anymore.  We've been using this for HTML rendering in the browser in a handful of places where we're doing interop with other libraries and need plain HTML as part of an existing API.  With React's awesome release process, this is only a warning for now.\n\nI read around a bit but couldn't quite tell what the direction folks wanted to go with the build setup here.  In my poking around I just made this PR as a workaround, adding another secret property to expose `ReactDOMServer`, and a build step to produce this a UMD artifact in the same way that `react-dom` is built in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/4814.    This PR likely won't be useful, and closing it right away makes sense to me, but if anyone else needs a one-off build for this I figured it's worth posting.\n\nLonger term, I'd second the idea that this rendering code has uses beyond just server rendering, and that it may be worth including in `ReactDOM` as @jimfb suggested in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5311#issuecomment-152010489.\n",
