  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nImprovement to a new feature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behaviour?**\r\n\r\nI believe the proposed name `componentDidCatch` is a little confusing.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, this proposal is about changing the signature from\r\n\r\n```componentDidCatch(error, info)```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```componentDidCatchError(error, message)```\r\n\r\nNaming conventions are often half-jokingly labelled as one of the most difficult things in computer\r\nscience but I think we could easily tweak the signature of the componentDidCatch lifecycle method\r\nthat is being introduced in React 16.\r\n\r\nI am heavily inspired by the principles covered in the famous Clean Code book by Robert C. Martin\r\nand I particularly like the idea of solid naming conventions where you can basically _guess_ what a\r\nfunction does or what sort of variable you are dealing with by literally reading their names. Yes, every\r\nsoftware developer in the world will associate the term \"catch\" with the try/catch construct but\r\nthe first question that came to my mind when I came across `componentDidCatch` was something\r\nalong the lines of \"catch what?\".\r\n\r\nSo I think we could avoid this confusion and make the new method a bit more intuitive if we:\r\n1. renamed it to either `componentDidCatchError` or `componentDidCatchException` and\r\n2. renamed the second argument to something that would better indicate we are expecting a string,\r\ne.g. `message` or `errorMessage`. I just find the term \"info\" that you have used in your recent\r\nblog post a little vague as it's not immediately obvious whether it is meant to be a string or maybe\r\nan object.\r\n\r\nAnd before I forget, the actual functionality of this new method seems great and I can't wait for\r\nan opportunity to implement it in my projects!\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16",
