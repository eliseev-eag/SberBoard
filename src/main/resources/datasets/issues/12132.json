For English this is not visible for the user, but for Farsi the letters become disconnected (for them it looks like \"t h i s\")\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/79/\r\n\r\n`<p>{new String(\"hello\")}</p>`\r\n\r\nFive separate text elements are rendered. In Chrome Inspector, it looks like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1054229/35676445-1955683c-074c-11e8-8068-a35b9edd68ae.png)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe value represented by the String object to be rendered just like any native string value would.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 1.0.17, tested on Chrome on Ubuntu. Likely unrelated to version or OS.\r\n",
