  "body": "Hello.\n\nWe using react for some our projects and found, what on staging servers it start generate warning about \"It looks like you're using a minified copy of the development build of React. When deploying React apps to production, make sure to use the production build which skips development warnings and is faster\". \n\nWe still need all possible warnings about propTypes or about controlled/uncontrolled components to debug all issues on environment, which as close as possible to production, but still is not production. In this case \"staging\" environment should be builded with minification to check app before delivering on production. \n\nProposal: remove this warning (https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/67f8524e88abbf1ac0fd86d38a0477d11fbc7b3e/src/renderers/dom/ReactDOM.js#L94-L100) for `NODE_ENV === 'staging'` env, if this possible. \n\nThanks.\n",
