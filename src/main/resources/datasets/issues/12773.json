Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt should not rerender the whole video it should only change the property. Once I have the property changed it rerenders the whole video and starts again. If I use any third party html parser then video doesn't restart but it is not playing too.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16.3.1\r\nChrome latest version\r\n\r\n",
