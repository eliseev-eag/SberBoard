  "body": "This warns about the common mistake of using setState directly in an effect without a dependency list â€” which too easily leads to loops. This is the only case where I propose that we'd warn for dep-less useEffect. It looks like this:\r\n\r\n![Screen Recording 2019-03-21 at 08 53 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/54784344-8aeb1180-4c1b-11e9-8fac-ed2024a1f712.gif)\r\n\r\nIt won't warn you about `setState` nested in another function (it'll assume you know what you're doing). Only top level ones right in the effect.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't check for early returns. I considered this but then thought the pattern is still too fragile. With autofix it's not too annoying anyway.",
