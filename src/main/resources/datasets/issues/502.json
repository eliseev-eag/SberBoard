  "body": "Is there a good reason why this isn't being done already? `key` and `char` are mentioned in the code, but `char` has since been deprecated in the standard and `key` relies on the browser to implement, leaving `which` as the only cross-browser solution for now. There doesn't seem to be a full-featured polyfill either that could be recommended as a substitute for `key`-support.\n\nIE8 and older browsers don't support `which`, but only `keyCode` and `charCode`, seeing as we have the synthetic events, normalizing behavior according to (old) standards should be better than pushing it onto the developer.\n\n**I propose that this PR be closed and that this solution be used instead https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/607**\n",
