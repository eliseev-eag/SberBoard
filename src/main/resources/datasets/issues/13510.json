  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug, but more of a minor annoyance.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\n**tl;dr** Updating a component that makes a resource request which trigger state updates causes a warning to be displayed.\r\n\r\n(This description is based off of a modified version of the `unstable_async/fixtures` example.)\r\n\r\nGiven a component that makes a resource call, which triggers React updates.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst someResource = createResource(fetchUserData);\r\n\r\nfunction UserDetails(props) {\r\n  // another component is \"plugged in\" to this resource, so\r\n  // calling read() will trigger setState() calls in that component\r\n  const data = someResource.read(props.id);\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>{data}</div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen  the resource requesting component is mounting, it is an indeterminate component. During updates, it is known to be a functional component. In both instances, the component is called to get a return value. The difference being that when it is known to be a functional component, the renderer's phase is set to `render` before calling the function.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// mountIndeterminateComponent()\r\nconst value = UserDetails(...);\r\n\r\n// updateFunctionalComponent()\r\nsetCurrentPhase('render');\r\nconst value = UserDetails(...);\r\nsetCurrentPhase(null);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause the phase is set to `render` for the functional component, we get a warning that React `Cannot update during an existing state transition...` (from `warnAboutInvalidUpdates()`).\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/0484pzv330\r\n\r\nThis is the `unstable_async/suspense` demo, but has been modified to add a button to navigate the user details for `acdlite` from any other user page.\r\n\r\n1. Click on any user (besides `Andrew Clark`, the warning is only triggered when his data is not cached).\r\n2. Click on the `Go to Andrew Clark` button.\r\n\r\nIn the console, there will be a warning about updating during an existing state transition.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nNo warning\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nMaster build",
