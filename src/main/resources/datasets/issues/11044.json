  "body": "We have come across a use case where React renders into a comment node\r\nwith no parent, and this code assumes that there is always a parent node\r\nfor a comment node.\r\n\r\n**what is the change?:**\r\n- Instead of trying to succeed somehow when rendering into a commentNode\r\n  which has no parent, we should throw an informative error.\r\n- Changes the test to check for the informative error\r\n- Also updates the test to use a valid commentNode; previously the test\r\n  was failing because apparently you need the commentNode to have the\r\n  text ' react-mount-point-unstable ' and not just\r\n  'react-mount-point-unstable'.\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nTo debug and mitigate effect of bug reported in https://our.intern.facebook.com/intern/tasks/?t=22198152\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\n`yarn test src/renderers/dom/shared/__tests__/ReactMount-test.js`\r\n\r\n**issue:**\r\nSee internal task https://our.intern.facebook.com/intern/tasks/?t=22198152",
