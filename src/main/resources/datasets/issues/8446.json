  "body": "### Add iterable cases to MultiChildReconcile test 0fa8116f0f4748a1f8a9b0f053e47327787d40a1\r\n\r\nStack currently supports rendering iterables, but Fiber does not.\r\n\r\nPreviously we didn't have any public API tests for iterables. We have tests for traverseAllChildren() which is shared between React.Children and Stack. However Fiber doesn't currently use it, and likely won't. So this commit is a first step towards actually testing iterable support via public API. The next step will be to port traverseAllChildren() tests to test React.Children API instead.\r\n\r\n### Implement iterable reconciliation in Fiber 71eefd073aefd32ef3ec0ecd4240f3aa181b8664\r\n\r\nThis uses the same exact algorithm as array reconciliation but uses iterator to step through.\r\n\r\nThis gets reconcile tests to pass again but introduces a regression in ReactMultiChildText case which uses Maps as children. It passed before because Maps were ignored, but now it's failing because this actually runs the Map code path in Fiber. We can throw early in this case when we want to follow up on this.\r\n\r\n### Rewrite traverseAllChildren() tests against React.Children API 2b7e0a0cc4f2944ad9e7ea9472ade511f97120dd\r\n\r\nThis function was used in React.Children and Stack.\r\nThe corresponding reconciliation functionality is being tested by ReactMultiChild tests.\r\nSo we can move these tests to ReactChildren and test its public API.",
