  "body": "DevTools doesn't currently handle extremely deep trees (#16491) or extremely wide trees (#16501) very well, due to recursion in the backend interface. This PR removes _most_ of that.\r\n\r\nAs a sanity test, I confirmed that after this refactor, DevTools was able to handle the following:\r\n```js\r\nconst Child = ({ children = null }) => children;\r\n\r\nconst Deep = () => {\r\n  let children = null;\r\n  for (let i = 0; i < 15000; i++) {\r\n    children = <Child>{children}</Child>;\r\n  }\r\n  return children;\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst Wide = () => {\r\n  let children = [];\r\n  for (let i = 0; i < 15000; i++) {\r\n    children.push(<Child key={i} />);\r\n  }\r\n  return children;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nMigrated from https://github.com/bvaughn/react-devtools-experimental/pull/385",
