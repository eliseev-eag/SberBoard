  "body": "Not reporting a bug or issue. I just wanted to let you know I found this part of the walk-through to be unclear and confusing and others may, too:\n\n> To get started using the tutorial, just start editing public/index.html.\n> ## Getting started\n> \n> For this tutorial, we'll use prebuilt JavaScript files on a CDN. Open up your favorite editor and create a new HTML document:\n\nIt took me a while to figure out whether I was supposed to be editing in the index.html file provided when I cloned the repo or whether I should make a new file and how to link the two files if they were both necessary.\n\nI'm new to React and pretty new to programming overall, but I do have some Javascript and Javascript framework experience. I really enjoyed the walk-through because it was simple to get started, so thanks for the helpful resource!!\n",
