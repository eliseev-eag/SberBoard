  "body": "Hello,\r\nI would like to start using React, but am very concerned about the examples I am seeing. I would like to use React to interact with lots of data.\r\nI am a screen reader user and Facebook has put out lots of articles on react’s accessibility:\r\nhttps://code.facebook.com/posts/435862739941212/making-react-native-apps-accessible/\r\nhttps://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility.html\r\n\r\nThese are great, but strangely, the examples I have read that the React developers have put out are not accessible:\r\nhttps://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html\r\nhttps://facebook.github.io/fixed-data-table/example-object-data.html\r\n\r\nFor the tutorial, there are several problems: First is that codepen is not very accessible, so seeing examples there is really difficult. Second, there is a huge number of buttons that have no text in them in the tic-tac-toe game. Third, there doesn’t seem to be any use of a table. If I remember correctly, a tic-tac-toe board is in a square. A 4 by 4 set of table boxes would really help in making a beautiful layout for screen reader users.\r\n\r\nFor the datatable, there is no table! I think this table is just div elements with CSS. Why? It says it is a table. To make this accessible, one needs to use the table tag, the th tag, the tr tag and the td tag. There is a fantastic article on how to make HTML tables:\r\nhttp://webaim.org/techniques/tables/data\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is really scary for me because if developers are looking at the above examples and learning how to code from them, then they are learning how to code in an inaccessible manor. Not only does this mean that I can’t learn to use react from the official tutorial, but any developer who goes through the official tutorial will have been exposed to an app that is supposed to model how their apps should look like. If there apps look like the tutorial, I will basically not be able to use any app made with react best practices.\r\n\r\nI’m really confused, if react does all the actual rendering, why are all the rendered elements not in perfect HTML? Accessibility is not the use of an API, in fact, an accessibility API just makes things more difficult for everyone by adding complexity into something that is super easy. The best way of making screen reader accessible apps is by using HTML tags, not including div or span. React has done an amazing thing by controlling HTML rendering and now all that needs to be done is make that renderer output proper HTML which will then be accessible.\r\nIf Facebook’s developers are not writing accessible apps by default, I think that there should be more reinforcement of good coding practices. Could there be a warning when a button is missing text in between the opening and closing tags? Could there be a warning when images do not have alt text? Could there be a warning when links don’t have text in between the opening and closing tags? Could the app throw an error when input boxes are not coupled with a label element? Could errors and warnings please be given by React when an app does not follow good coding practices?\r\nThis would not only help the React team make accessible examples, but it will help to insure an accessible web for me and the other 39000000 screen reader users in the world.\r\nhttp://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs282/en/\r\nPlease let me know how I can help.\r\nThank you!",
