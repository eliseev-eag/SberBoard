It's also *impossible* to implement with a babel compiler trick, because we need to detect these components/loops at runtime, and we can't just add a `secondKey` prop everywhere because we'd have a mess in our props.\r\n\r\nIt seems like it's rather end-user-hostile to not at least give a backdoor into accessing keys, so my proposal, for all the weird edge case uses like our own here, would be to expose:\r\n\r\n```React.getKey()```\r\n\r\nWhich would take a component instance and return the key for it.\r\n\r\nThere could be appropriate warnings around it in documentation and elsewhere.",
