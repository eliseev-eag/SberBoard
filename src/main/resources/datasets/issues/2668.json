  "body": "I realize that once you start patching the internals of a project it's pretty much at your own risk, but in this case I was looking to add a `stateTypes` plugin which would act similar to `propTypes` / `contextTypes`, where you could have validations built-in for state as they change over time. Our application is using a fully immutable data store and uses a ton of `state` to be able to isolate individual units of the root data to prevent unnecessary re-renders when we know exactly where the path has changed.\n\nI was able to get [this working](https://github.com/tgriesser/state-types-react/blob/master/index.js) pretty quickly, but I'm unable to `SpecPolicy.DEFINE_MANY` because the `ReactCompositeComponentInterface` is internal.\n\nI could see why exposing this fully might be a bad idea, but I wanted to see if there has been any discussion of allowing consumers to hook into the `SpecPolicy` behavior and define their own merge-able types outside of the core.\n",
