Each commit should be associated to a state update somewhere in the tree, and wherever that happened should trigger at least one component to re-render, but that didn't appear to happen here.\r\n\r\nI also verified that I don't have any components filtered out:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1500684/66011428-57b5f480-e480-11e9-9e66-7cf86f8ba48f.png)\r\n\r\nAnd I didn't filter any commits either:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1500684/66011433-5ab0e500-e480-11e9-97a8-be202351870d.png)\r\n\r\nHere's the exported profile data:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/kentcdodds/dbff66043653333cd22cb9261a08550b\r\n\r\nAnd here's the repo where you can pull it down and reproduce yourself: https://github.com/kentcdodds/bookshelf. The component we're looking at is here: https://github.com/kentcdodds/bookshelf/blob/master/src/unauthenticated-app.js\r\n\r\nSorry I can't give a more direct reproduction.",
