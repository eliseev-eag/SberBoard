  "body": "Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask the question, but I thought it might be better to have this explained somewhere that wasn't as ephemeral as the IRC channelâ€¦\n\nStoring an instance and trying to reuse it results in [an error](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/eebcf9f888b8a8fc3ed1f31c2789584a235aa089/src/core/ReactComponent.js#L255-L261):\n\n```\nCan only mount an unmounted component. Make sure to avoid storing components between renders or reusing a single component instance in multiple places.\n```\n\nRecently, I started wondering, if these are just descriptors, why is that desired behavior? Or is it a concession for the sake of performance? It seems like there are some good reasons (memoization, worry-free duplication, etc) why it would be preferable for React not to mutate them so they could be reused.\n\nThanks!\n",
