  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nBug\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\nWhen you have an unexpected prop in a component but that prop is not meant to be generated on the HTML DOM so that is set to {null}, React triggers this warning:\n\n```\nWarning: Unknown prop `activeClassName` on <h1> tag. Remove this prop from the element. For details, see https://fb.me/react-unknown-prop\n    in h1 (created by HelloWorldComponent)\n    in HelloWorldComponent\n```\n\nThe actual use case is to have a reusable component called `<Anchor>` and it'd be either `<Link activeClassName=\"'is-active\" />` or `<a activeClassName={null} />`. [Here's our actual code.](https://github.com/worona/worona-dashboard/blob/dev/client/packages/bulma-dashboard-theme-worona/src/components/Header/MenuItem.jsx#L25)\nIn the HTML output, there's no any activeClassName attribute for the second case, so there shouldn't be any react warning.\n\n**Example reproducing it**\nI've reproduced the issue in a simple example here:\nhttps://jsbin.com/bozuwuq/edit?html,js,console,output\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nDon't warn when a prop is defined to {null} and, therefore, never generated in the DOM.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\nReact version: 15.3.0\nOS: Ubuntu and Mac OS X. Chromium and Google Chrome.\n",
