  "body": "When you pass a boolean to some attributes (e.g. `autoSave`, `autoCorrect`) in 15, they don't work correctly because they actually want a specific string (`yes` and `no`). I think there were also some attributes that want `on` and `off`.\r\n\r\nLet's just “make them work”? Could use a special flag/whitelist for that. There should be very few of these.\r\n\r\nSimilarly we should probably make `<script crossOrigin />` be valid and turn into `<script crossOrigin=\"anonymous\" />`. Currently I don’t think this works on master.",
