  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\n\nbug\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\n\nReact rendered html depends on order of keys in props, for example:\n\n``` js\n{href: 'http://example.com', className: 'link'}\n// and\n{className: 'link', href: 'http://example.com'}\n```\n\ngives two different html:\n\n``` html\n<a href=\"http://example.com\" class=\"link\"></a>\n<a class=\"link\" href=\"http://example.com\"></a>\n```\n\nYou can see that `href` and `class` attributes are reversed.\n\nThis is critical, when you have isomorphic application, and two different renders: nodejs on server and something on client.\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n\nRendered html must not depend on order of keys in any objects.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\nReact 15\nnodejs 5.11\nchrome (actual)\n\nIn some cases node5.x can change order of keys, and we get a warning about checksum mismatch on client, because of two \"different\" html.\n",
