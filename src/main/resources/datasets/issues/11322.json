  "body": "Just before I have my view, please take a look at these 2 examples\r\n\r\nHello World React => [App.jsx](https://git.io/vdNQb)\r\nHello World Vue => [App.vue](https://git.io/vdNQN)\r\n\r\nIdentical? Isn't it?\r\nYes these are two different **paradigm** but hey they are expressing same things and both are doing it in the same way by taking benefits of the Virtual DOM \r\n\r\nMy Feature Request is that,\r\nJust like Vue supports [JSX](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/render-function.html) for Programmatic situations.\r\nI think React should also support HTML5 Templates for Non Programmatic situations?? \r\n\r\nAlso, **Imagine trying to create a website based on an existing theme that you purchased. Changing it over to JSX literally will feel like sticking a knife through your eyeballs. With Templates, existing HTML just works.**\r\n\r\nPlease also note that Programmatic situations have a low use case\r\nand Non Programmatic situations have a high use case.",
