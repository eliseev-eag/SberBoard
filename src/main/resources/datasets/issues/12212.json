  "body": "Built-in React Native components (e.g. `View`) currently trigger deprecation warnings for lifecycles `componentWillMount` and `componentWillReceiveProps` due to [these DEV-only mixins added by the `NativeMethodsMixin` component](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/41b8c65f1e81ba48192fbb65fd5c742638ef4f82/packages/react-native-renderer/src/NativeMethodsMixin.js#L183-L207).\r\n\r\nLong term, we should remove the deprecated lifecycles _but_ for the time being, I think we should just suppress the warnings from _the builtin_ methods specifically using a similar technique as the [`react-lifecycles-compat` polyfill](https://github.com/reactjs/react-lifecycles-compat). This will hopefully improve the in-between period for the RN community significantly.",
