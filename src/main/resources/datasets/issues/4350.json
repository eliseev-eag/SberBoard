  "body": "I have a controller which consist of many views in it. Only my controller is having state and I pass data to my views through props. Now problem is suppose  my view depends on number of product.\nSay we have more than 100 products and each product consist of number of properties related to it. Now each property also have their own property on it. So if I change value of a sub-property then i have to re-render. No We dispatch the change event so it again start re-rendering from controller and it have to process through all the codes like all condition checks, loops etc which is time consuming. So how should we achieve it flux-react architecture? \n",
