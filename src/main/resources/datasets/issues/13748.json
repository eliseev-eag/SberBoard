It has since been renamed to `React.memo()`.\r\n\r\nA higher-order component version of the `React.PureComponent` class. During an update, the previous props are compared to the new props. If they are the same, React will skip rendering the component and its children.\r\n\r\nUnlike userspace implementations, `pure` will not add an additional fiber to the tree.\r\n\r\nThe first argument must be a functional component; it does not work with classes.\r\n\r\n`pure` uses shallow comparison by default, like `React.PureComponent`. A custom comparison can be passed as the second argument.",
