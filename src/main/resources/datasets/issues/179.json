  "body": "This came up on IRC last night. Somebody was working having trouble testing React while using `$.trigger` to test an event handler & state change. `$.trigger` does use synthetic events (not `SyntheticEvent`s) but they claim to do best effort at matching real DOM events - http://api.jquery.com/trigger/.\n\nThe problem in this case was that the code was using `$.trigger('change')` on the checkbox. We either weren't handling the change event OR this is one of those cases where jQuery's events just weren't good enough. Using `$.trigger('click')` worked.\n\nWe might have fixed this in 0.4, I just haven't had a chance to test.\n\ndoesn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/robert_zaremba/LWXhs/4/\nworks: http://jsfiddle.net/LWXhs/5/\n",
