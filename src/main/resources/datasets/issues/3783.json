  "body": "Currently the React tests check that the dom produces the correct `innerHTML` containing a closing `</menuitem>` tag. However, this is against spec, and jsdom 1.0+ automatically strips out the closing tag because it should not be in the dom. This is the only failing test when upgrading Jest to the latest version of jsdom that still supports Node.js (3.1.2).\n\nAs discussed in #2266, apparently some older browsers have an issue with the menuitem void element not having a closing tag. So, since it is important to keep it around, but modern browsers are going to strip it anyway, I propose spying on the `mountComponent` function to see if it is trying to output the closing tag. That way we can be certain to attempt to inject a closing tag, but are not relying on the DOM implementation to verify that it worked.\n\nThis pull request contains my implementation of how to spy on, call through, and verify that the returned string is what we want. It is pretty ugly, but I'm not sure there is a better way to implement it. That said, I am very open to suggestions on better ways to do it.\n",
