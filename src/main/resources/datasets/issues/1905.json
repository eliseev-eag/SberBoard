  "body": "```\nReact.renderComponent(React.DOM.noscript(null, 1), document.body);\nReact.renderComponent(React.DOM.noscript(null, 2), document.body);\n```\n\nExecute that and it goes boom, IE8 throws away all children of `noscript` after render and violently screams if you in any way try to add children afterwards.\n\nShould you be mutating `noscript`? No, you shouldn't, but I imagine that reality is not quite as simple, where it could look something like:\n\n```\n<noscript>There are {count} items</noscript>\n```\n\nand there you have an error if `count` ever changes.\n\nPractically though, `noscript` content is useless client-side and I see no reason why we shouldn't just discard any children passed to it client-side (for performance gains). If there are children left there from server-rendering, they will stay as-is until the `noscript` is removed from the DOM at a later time.\n\nThis could easily be done by adding a simple `ReactDOMNoScript` component that just returns `noscript(this.props, null)` if it's not for server-rendering. I could whip up a PR if you guys think it's a good idea? @zpao?\n",
