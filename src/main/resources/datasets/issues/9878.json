  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nfeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThe react package does not provide a list of acceptable props for html node (div, span, etc.)\r\nSometimes, other packages pass on other props, like react-redux passing `dispatch` when no `mapDispatchToProps` is provided. This (below) will pop an error saying there's an unknown prop `dispatch` on a `div` tag\r\n```\r\nconst { myProp1, myProp2, ...otherProps } = this.props\r\nreturn <div {...otherProps}>...</div>\r\n ```\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nSince React is using a list of those props for validation, the react package should also provide them to allow react users to make sure they pass on normal props\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n15.5\r\n",
