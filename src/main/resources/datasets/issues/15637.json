Once the bug begins happening, the user no longer needs to scroll; the memory will keep increasing without any input. 2GB of memory used within a couple of minutes:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8306435/57641484-1c736180-7583-11e9-824a-810d105743ec.png)\r\n\r\nThis is part of a larger application that has meant it has become unusable with react 16x. It uses `react-virtualized`, and we also created our own table virtualization, but this memory leak happens with both of them, hence creating this issue.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would expect garbage collection to happen at some point and look like the following (The following is the same example with no user input)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8306435/57642029-6f99e400-7584-11e9-930c-5566db954dc3.png)\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThis is tested in chrome `74.0.3729.131` and firefox `66.0.5` on react `16.8.6`. We believe it is for all react `16x`",
