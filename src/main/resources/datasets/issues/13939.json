  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nfeature\r\n\r\nRight now most packages export their API with a weird solution for both jest and rollup (for [example](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react/index.js#L16)). \r\nAlso they export an object as default (for [example](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react/src/React.js#L37)).\r\n\r\nThe expected way of doing this is implemented in the newer packages like react-is by using named exports for top export and wild export for entry point (package's [entry point](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-is/index.js#L12) and [top export](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-is/src/ReactIs.js#L26)).\r\n\r\nI would like to research for a refactor strategy and receive suggestions if to do it or not.\r\n\r\nI have tried some refactoring for React and ReactDOM [here](https://github.com/itamar244/react)\r\n\r\nIt will be my first pull request for react but I have used react for two years and looked sometimes on the sources of this repo.",
