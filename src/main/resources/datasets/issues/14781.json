The node that's still hanging in the dom should not be there.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/react-spring/react-spring/issues/490\r\n\r\ntest sandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/vjp41lkrrl\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nthe node should disappear\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
