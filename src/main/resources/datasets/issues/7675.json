  "body": "Flow doesn't like that we put null-check conditions into variables as it loses track of them. I rewrote the logic a bit and took extra care of minimizing the extra work. The only place where I couldn't make it better is for the `typeof prevElement` which is duplicated twice, but I'm guessing that's not so bad...\n\nI had to update some ReactNative files as they use the baked in flow definition which clashes with the internal one. I'm not sure if this is fine?\n",
