  "body": "Hi guys!\r\n\r\nI've a bug with Link component on Internet Explorer 9 only.\r\n\r\nI've 16.8.4 version of React in my project and every works fine, but when I use the Link component on IE 9 to navigate in the app, I've found a critical bug.\r\n\r\nWhen I click in an anchor that have been generated by Link component the expected behavior is that I can navigate through my app without page refreshes and this works well on Chrome, Safari and IE 10 and 11, but with IE 9 when I do click in the anchor, the entire page is refreshed and I lose redux's and javascript's state.\r\n\r\nAre there anyone with this issue?",
