  "body": "All of these features are based on features of React's internal scheduler. The eventual goal is to lift as much as possible out of the React internals into the Scheduler package.\r\n\r\nIncludes some renaming of existing methods.\r\n\r\n- `scheduleWork` is now `scheduleCallback`\r\n- `cancelScheduledWork` is now `cancelCallback`\r\n\r\nPriority levels\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nAdds the ability to schedule callbacks at different priority levels. The current levels are (final names TBD):\r\n\r\n- Immediate priority. Fires at the end of the outermost currently executing (similar to a microtask).\r\n- Interactive priority. Fires within a few hundred milliseconds. This should only be used to provide quick feedback to the user as a result of an interaction.\r\n- Normal priority. This is the default. Fires within several seconds.\r\n- \"Maybe\" priority. Only fires if there's nothing else to do. Used for prerendering or warming a cache.\r\n\r\nThe priority is changed using `runWithPriority`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrunWithPriority(InteractivePriority, () => {\r\n  scheduleCallback(callback);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nContinuations\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nAdds the ability for a callback to yield without losing its place in the queue, by returning a continuation. The continuation will have the same expiration as the callback that yielded.\r\n\r\n\r\nWrapped callbacks\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nAdds the ability to wrap a callback so that, when it is called, it receives the priority of the current execution context.\r\n\r\n@n8schloss",
