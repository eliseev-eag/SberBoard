  "body": "The `If-Else in JSX` page only offers up ternary expressions as a solution to conditional logic inside JSX. But perhaps IIFEs should also get a mention?\n\nRealizing I could do IIFEs inside JSX helped \"flesh out\" my mental model of how JSX actually works, so I suspect it would aide others in the same way as well. Furthermore, with the advent of ES6 arrow functions, they aren't too verbose either.\n\nA code example utilizing an IIFE might be overkill, but at least a passing mention would be nice.\n",
