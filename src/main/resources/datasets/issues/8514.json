This is not how undo works normally with an uncontrolled component. Undo seems to work as expected with input components.\r\n\r\nWith a controlled textarea component, you can only undo one letter at a time. The normal undo works with some kind of algorithm for how much is going to be un- or redone.\r\n\r\nYou can try the difference in this codepen:\r\n\r\nhttps://codepen.io/fabsor/pen/LbmBOv\r\n\r\nTested with React 15.3.1 and Chrome 54 and Chrome Canary. Works as expected in Firefox and Safari. It might be a Chrome bug?",
