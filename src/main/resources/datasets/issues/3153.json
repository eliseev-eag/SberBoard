  "body": "I was trying to read [this page](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2013/11/05/thinking-in-react.html) but none of the code snippets show up.\n\nI tracked it to HTTP iframe embeds, and me using HTTPS on github pages.\n\nMixed content is completely blocked in most browsers these days. HTTPS embeds in pages served over HTTP works fine, though. And jsfiddle supports HTTPS embeds. I see no reason to prefer `http` embeds on pages that can be served over `https`.\n\nCan all embeds be changed to use `https://`? Also it should help to have this in the guidelines and maybe enforced with a test case.\n\nP.S: I can not read the page properly without having to turn off HTTPS Everywhere extension, and I'd prefer to not have to do that.\n",
