  "body": "Currently React relies on a global `window` (and `document` and `navigator`).\nThis works in a browser and it works in other environments if one sets a global `window`.\nHowever, relying on globals prevents multiple independent React engines from running together.\n\nTesting, for example, benefits strongly from isolated environments. It would be nice if one could run separate tests with `jsdom` without manually cleaning up the `window` every time.\nAnother use case is for programatic behaviour inspection. It's interesting to load multiple windows with `jsdom` and compare the behavior of one's library with different calls. If React is involved, however, this is impossible.\n\nAvoiding relying on globals can be added in a backwards-compatible fashion. If there is a global `window` and `document`, keep the existing behavior. If there isn't, instead of exposing an API, expose a factory taking a `window` and returning an API. For example, see how [jQuery did it](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/intro.js#L25).\n\nA decision to avoid globals means refactoring existing code base to pass `window` explicitly everywhere, and maintaining that attitude in the future. What is your opinion on such a feature?\n",
