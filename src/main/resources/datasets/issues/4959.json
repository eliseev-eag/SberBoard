  "body": "React now only uses `Object.create` and `Object.freeze` in a couple places (one each, based on my grepping).  This commit removes the dependency on having non-functional or incomplete shams for these methods in the global environment.\n\nAs previously discussed, use of `Object.freeze` merely needs to be guarded by a check for whether it exists.  The discussed remedy for `Object.create` was to \"use ES6 classes,\" but that doesn't seem in line with current style, and in any case it would be a larger change.  The necessary code to perform `Object.create(proto)` with a non-null `proto` is three lines of code that are well-known to most developers.  They could be inlined or broken out into a utility (which is what I chose here).\n\nThis code has not been tested in IE 8 yet; I wanted to start the ball rolling.\n",
