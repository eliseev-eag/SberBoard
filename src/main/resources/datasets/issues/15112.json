Like the previous PR, this is only intended for internal FB testing right now. I also added flags around everything, so bundle size shouldn't regress other than a few bytes (if it does, I've done something wrong with DCE).\r\n\r\nI've also added relevant fiber tests to ensure the warnings fire as expected.",
