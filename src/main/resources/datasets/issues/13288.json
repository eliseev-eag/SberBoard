  "body": "<!--\r\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\r\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nfeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n`<Surface>` of canvas mode and `<Surface>` of svg mode cannot be used in a document at the same time.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nTwo more `<Surface>` components with each other modes can be used in a document at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently developers can set only one rending mode globally in react-art, using `setCurrent()` of `art/modes/current` module. So there is no way to use `<Surface>` of canvas mode and `<Surface>` of svg mode in a document together. On the other hand, `art.js` internally used in `react-art` provides a way to use each other modes together as directly importing their corresponding modules.  (e.g. svg.js for svg mode, canvas.js for canvas mode in `art.js` lib). \r\n\r\nI would like to suggest a way to set own rendering mode per instance of `<Surface>` Component by new property `mode`. This feature makes `<Surface>` with canvas mode and `<Surface>` with svg mode to be used together in a document like the following.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst {\r\n  Surface,\r\n  Group,\r\n  Shape\r\n} = require('react-art');\r\n\r\nclass TestComponent extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <React.Fragment>\r\n        <Surface mode=\"svg\" width={100} height={100}>\r\n          <Group>\r\n            <Shape width={10} height={10} />\r\n          </Group>\r\n        </Surface>\r\n        <Surface mode=\"canvas\" width={100} height={100}>\r\n          <Group>\r\n            <Shape width={10} height={10} />\r\n          </Group>\r\n        </Surface>\r\n      </React.Fragment>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `mode` property is not set, `<Surface>` works as canvas mode for compatibility.\r\n\r\nI have made a PR for this feature to show how to work and use it ([#13249](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13249)).\r\nAnd you can check this feature through `art` fixture of my PR.\r\n\r\nFeel free to discuss about this feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
