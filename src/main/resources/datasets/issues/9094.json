  "body": "I notice that sometimes I want to find the implement details of some functions or features(e.g,`React.createElement, React.createClass, PureComponent,Reconciliation...`).\r\n\r\nBut every time I should add `debugger` in the code,and step over and over to enter the method I want to look,or in the ide to press `ctrl` and click the identifier to enter the file,but the code is promiscuous and nested,so it is diffcult to read.\r\n\r\nSo I want to know that is there a good way to solve this?I guess there maybe is a internal system to work fine on this?",
