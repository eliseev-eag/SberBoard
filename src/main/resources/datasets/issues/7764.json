  "body": "So this is throwing me off. \n\nI was reading through a way (#3357) to update `defaultValue` and I saw one idea of using `forceUpdate`. I wanted to use key but the input I'm working doesn't change key. \nHere is what my input looks like\n\n```\n<input className=\"form-control\"\n                     placeholder=\"Minumum\"\n                     type=\"number\"\n                     value={arrMin[i]}\n                     step=\"any\"\n                     onChange={this.handleChange.bind(this)}\n```\n\nAnd here is my `handleChange`\n\n```\nhandleChange() {\n    this.forceUpdate();\n}\n```\n\nWhen I run  my program and type in the input box, I get:\n`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'forceUpdate' of undefined`\nBut the thing is I can update `defaultValue` and rerender it, or atleast I think I am rerendering it. But the typed values are actually being applied and I can rerender them with a toggle.\n\nUPDATE:\nSo I later debugged the problem further, and I just made `onChange={this.forceUpdate}`\n\nSo why is it still being called in my other function?\n(btw if there's a better solution, I'd appreciate it :) )\n",
