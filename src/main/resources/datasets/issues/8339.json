  "body": "Edge and IE11 both show user marks and measures in the Dev Tools, so it's technically not accurate to say that only Chrome has this feature.\r\n\r\nHere's what this looks like in Edge:\r\n\r\n![2016-11-17 15_39_03-react app - microsoft edge](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/283842/20412882/554f12d0-acde-11e6-8857-db1a481cf7b2.png)\r\n\r\nBTW thank you forÂ promoting `performance.mark()` and `performance.measure()`. :smiley: Surfacing this info into the Dev Tools makes webdevs much more likely to use these APIs, and they're incredibly useful for telemetry, performance analyses, etc. It's great to see React leading on this.",
