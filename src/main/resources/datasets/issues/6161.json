  "body": "This is WIP. I want to see if this is something you're interested in and if so I can clean everything up.\n1. Can support for `displayName` on stateless functional components be documented? (It would seem so from https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4915#issuecomment-166032807.)\n2. There seems to be some inconsistent application of `.displayName` / `.name` and I think there may be some holes (I'm only positive of one right now, the one in the failing test added here for the `key` warning on a stateless component with only `.name`.) Are you interested in patching up those holes?\n3. If so, are you interested in consolidating that logic so it's applied consistently everywhere it's needed? That's the idea behind the `getComponentName` added here.\n",
