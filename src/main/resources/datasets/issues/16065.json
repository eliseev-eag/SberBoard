  "body": "With the very likely addition of first-class event targets, the existing naming of `targetEventTypes` and `rootEventTypes` becomes a bit confusing. This PR renames them to include `host`, which is exactly what they are â€“ host events that we register on the specific platform. Event \"types\" was also a bit confusing too, as originally they were only strings, but then became objects where you could define if something was passive etc. This should hopefully make things easier to understand.",
