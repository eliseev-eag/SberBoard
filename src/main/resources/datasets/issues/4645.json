  "body": "Please add support for custom non-standard DOM events, ideally through a public API but if that's a \"no go\"  at least some way that would not require forking the code base.\n\nHere is my attempt of exposing non-standard events after getting some insights on IRC, unfortunately it still does not work (as event listeners are not registered) and I am not sure if there is more whitelists somewhere that skips those custom events:\nhttps://gist.github.com/Gozala/a977973957fcee9c5671\n\nP.S.: Any help in changing this snippet to make it work is also greatly appreciated\n",
