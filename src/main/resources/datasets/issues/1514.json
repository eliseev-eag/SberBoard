  "body": "We discussed this briefly some time ago, because `&#32;` is unescaped in the parser and JSX receives no information about it, it ends up being identical to just ` ` (a regular space) which is trimmed by JSX if appearing left/right-most on a line.\n\nHere's a simple proposal that moves the unescaping from the parser to JSX, I also made the unescaping routine a bit more accurate while also making it lenient like browsers, so `XJS & JSX` is valid (`XJS &amp; JSX` is quite cumbersome and annoying).\n\nAlternative implementation could have the parser parse both `XJSText` and `XJSEntity` for instance, and introducing `XJSStringLiteral` which would then consist of one or more `XJSText`/`XJSEntity`. This is perhaps the neater solution, but also more invasive (I don't mind though).\n\nFeel free to agree, disagree, reject, etc.\n\nDepends on https://github.com/facebook/esprima/pull/19\n",
