  "body": "The only bug number that I have memorized at this point is #140. It keeps coming up, and maintaining the ever-growing whitelist is infuriating.\n\nAs a baby step toward fixing that bug, I think it would be nice to know if the spread operator is used during element creation, since this is the primary way that attributes could be accidentally passed to an element. We could then only enforce the whitelist on elements that are using the spread operator, as a baby step toward eliminating the whitelist altogether. In order to do this though, I think we need to modify the transform (Babel?), right? Do we want to file a bug against them?\n\nThis issue is mostly exploratory, to get an idea of what would need to be involved to do this effectively. RFC: @spicyj, @sebmarkbage \n",
