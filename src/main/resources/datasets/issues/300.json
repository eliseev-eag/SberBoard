  "body": "http://jsfiddle.net/chenglou/ZEKbB/1/\n\nBehavior:\n- Chrome: nothing at all.\n- Safari: works upon menu dismissal (and therefore item selection since that triggers dismissal), although for this reason it's triggered after the fade out animation rather than immediately.\n- Firefox: works on both clicking select and clicking on an option, but not on menu dismissal.\n- Mobile Safari: works on clicking the select, but not its option.\n- Opera: (oh man) works on clicking an option and on menu dismissal, the latter only when the focus on the drop down is lost and regained.\n- IE: triggers on every click, in menu and upon opening/dismissing the dropdown\n\nBy the way, This is a browser inconsistency. Not React's fault.\n",
