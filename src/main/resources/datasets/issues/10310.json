  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nA bug \r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI am using the [react-modal](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal) library and tested it under React 16 beta. It throws an error when I try to close the modal.\r\n\r\nThe reason is it calls `renderSubtreeIntoContainer` [here](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal/blob/master/src/components/Modal.js#L156) and expects an instance back. But sometimes it's null, so when it's closing and it's trying to read it's state [here](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal/blob/master/src/components/Modal.js#L132) you get a null reference error.\r\n\r\nIf you use the API like `<Modal isOpen={this.state.open} />` is works, but only because the component never tries to read from `this.portal`. If you use it like `this.state.open && <Modal />` you get the error, because it tries to read it in `componentWillUnmount`: https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal/blob/master/src/components/Modal.js#L132\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jlongster/fiber-modal-error\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n`renderSubtreeIntoContainer` should always return an instance so this modal librarly works (it will close).\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16 beta. It works in all previous versions.",
