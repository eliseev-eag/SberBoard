  "body": "Per @sebmarkbage, we want `isomorphic` folder to only contain the code necessary to author React components. It should not have dependencies on `ReactInstrumentation`, `ReactDebugTool`, and `devtools/*` friends, which themselves should be moved to `renderers/shared/`.\n\nThe only caller we to `ReactInstrumentation` we have right now in that folder is [`onSetState()`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/8ea1cf4ee0f5315c4190a9e67e15f0f7404cb0cf/src/isomorphic/modern/class/ReactComponent.js#L70) inside `ReactComponent`. We need to move it somewhere inside the renderer (e.g. in the update queue implementation).\n\nLabeling it as a `good first bug` because this mostly involves moving files. The goal is that files in `isomorphic` folder don’t contain anything that references `ReactInstrumentation`.\n\nThis is up for grabs but I’ll do it myself if no one takes it.\n",
