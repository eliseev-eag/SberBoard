  "body": "Hi, I really love React with JSX, but I have one big problem. I am using Google Closure Compiler with ADVANCED_MODE for production script, but it causes errors sice GCC renames props keys, because JSX compiler product scripts that with not quoted props keys. \n\nOf course, I could use React without JSX like `React.DOM.div(null, {'someProps': 'propValue'})` and it will work fine, but...it's not JSX,  and I like this form of writing component structure. Would be possible to add option into JSX compiler for quoting props keys, or is there any other solution for this, that I overlooked?\n",
