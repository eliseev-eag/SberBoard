  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\n\nFeature request.\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\n\nCurrently there is no high performance way to move a rendered element from one parent to another. It causes a lot of overhead, because it requires a full mountComponent in the new place, even if we reuse the component instance itself.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\nAll.\n\n**Why we need this**\n\nI am trying to optimize one specific case: I need to render a component invisibly in order to measure it's dimensions. After that I need to render same component in the visible area. Currently I need to buy an overhead (in my case 15-50ms) to do so, where in fact, when done in pure DOM, it is a simple .appendChild call with almost no overhead.\n\nTo be more specific here, I am talking about [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized/) library and more specific it's [CellMeasurer](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized/blob/master/source/CellMeasurer/CellMeasurer.js) component, which can become 50% faster if we can avoid that overhead.\n",
