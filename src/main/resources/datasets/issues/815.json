  "body": "Here's my idea. Please let me know if it's any good.\n\nRoutes in a single-page app basically just represent state (or props, depending on your perspective), and no-one does state better than React. Which makes me think that React will be awesome at route management.\n\nI've taken a stab at [making a single-page app in react](https://github.com/jaredly/github-issues-viewer), using Backbone.Router for routing, and it wasn't terrible. But it wasn't amazing, either. I had a [router with event handlers](https://github.com/jaredly/github-issues-viewer/blob/v0.1.2/lib/view.js#L36) that then called setState. But translating between route+params and state was very ad-hoc.\n\nIdeally, you could have a one-to-one mapping:\n\n```\n/people/joan/2-jan-13\n\n=>\n\n{\n   page: \"personArchive\",\n   params: {\n      person: \"joan\",\n      date: new Date(...)\n   }\n}\n```\n\n_And back again._\n\nSo you could call\n\n```\nsetRoute(\"personArchive\", {person: \"joan\", date: new Date(...)})\n```\n\nand it would do the right thing. Abstract the urls away so developers never have to care. They just read the props, state and route and render appropriately.\n\nAm I super off-base? Is there a better way to do state-conscious routing?\n\nI would love to put together a proof of concept if the idea sounds appealing.\n",
