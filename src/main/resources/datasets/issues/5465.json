  "body": "`isMounted` is already unavailable on ES6 classes, and we already have a warning saying we \"might\" remove them, but we don't actually have a github issue to deprecate them.  As per our discussions today, we are basically agreed that we're going to start moving away from `isMounted` and deprecate it.  We still need to figure out some good stories around promises (and related use cases).\n\nThis issue is to track progress toward that goal.\n\nFor background, please read:\n- https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/2787#issuecomment-68738793\n- https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3417\n- https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5420#issuecomment-155577641\n",
