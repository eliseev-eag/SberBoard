  "body": "I also audited the other places we call `unstable_wrap()` in the React DOMÂ bundle and verified that they didn't have a similar problem. We have pretty good suspense test coverage and pretty good tracing test coverage, but it seems like our test coverage of the overlap may be a little weak. (Although to be fair, one of the profiler tests would have caught this if I hadn't mistakenly overlooked it.)\r\n\r\nThis code has been around for a long time (PR #14429) but only started causing a noticeable problem after a recent React sync.",
