  "body": "When testing https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15687 internally, we encountered some issues where the invariant in `flushDiscreteUpdates` fired during legit tests.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this was because ReactDOM sets properties and attributes on elements on initial mount, which can also fire events on the DOM. We don't want these events to flush discrete events, so we now set a flag for this that we enable before setting DOM properties and then disable after setting them.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we felt that the `invariant` was maybe too strong, so this has been downgraded to a warning in DEV.",
