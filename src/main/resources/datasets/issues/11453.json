  "body": "Turning flags into named exports fixes the regression in dead code elimination (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11450).\r\n\r\nThis required some restructuring of how we verify that flag types match up. I used the `Check<>` trick combined with `import typeof`, as suggested by @calebmer.\r\n\r\nFor www, we can no longer re-export `require('ReactFeatureFlags')` directly, and instead destructure it. This means flags have to be known at init time. This is already the case so it's not a problem. In fact it may be better since it removes extra property access in tight paths.\r\n\r\nFor things that we *want* to be dynamic on www (currently, only performance flag which I haven't added yet) we can export a function to toggle it, and then put it on the secret exports. In fact this is better than just letting everyone mutate the flag at arbitrary times since we can provide, e.g., a ref counting interface to it.",
