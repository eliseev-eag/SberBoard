  "body": "Cryptic title I can imagine, but I am not aware that something like this would have been mentioned anywhere so far.\r\n\r\nI have a page showing some statistics and it's split into two even panels. The left panel is showing some numbers and contains a form to set necessary filters. The right panel is showing some other details about filtered data. Initially, only filter form is visible, nothing else.\r\n\r\nThe user sets the filter and hits the \"filter\" button to send out a request. There is a requirement to show a text loader in the left panel and the right panel should be showing content loader animation. Too many loaders perhaps? Well, it kinda makes sense in this context :)\r\n\r\nNow my confusion is how to achieve that. Obviously, I don't want each panel to run the same query on its own. I would like to do that once in the upper level. I can surely pass down the `isLoading` prop to both panels. However, I am not too happy about it, because once there will be a fully fledged data fetching relying on the Suspense, it would mean that for such scenarios I will need to fall back to a regular solution. Am I misunderstanding something in here?",
