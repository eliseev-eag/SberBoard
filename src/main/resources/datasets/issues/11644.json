  "body": "**Not to be merged**\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation work for a memory leak on React Native, we found that `nextRoot` was never set to `null` and left in that state upon the view fulling being unmounted. I believe that is has to do with the fact that we set `nextRoot` and `nextUnitOfWork` to `null`, then immediately call `requestWork()` which sets them back again.\r\n\r\nThis results in a memory leak as the node tree of `nextRoot` never gets garbage collected.\r\n\r\nThis is more of a temporary research fix, rather than an explicit fix. I'm sure @acdlite will have a concrete fix based from this.",
