  "body": "I'm having a hard time with `TestUtils.Simulate`, which are definitely not behaving as expected.\n\nBasically I have an input field of type text and I try to change it's content, click it and press some keys.\nNo rocket science, but all the \"editing\" stuff fails miserably.\n\nI wrote a small JSBin to showcase what the component I'm testing should do:\nhttps://jsbin.com/hutujemoku/13/edit?html,js,output\n\nAnd I've also wrote a small repo to showcase the failing tests:\nhttps://github.com/dmatteo/simulate-test\n\nWhat's going on?\n\np.s. the bin is running on 0.13.1 while the repo is running on 0.12.2, because that is what I'm using still. Nevertheless, I've also tried with 0.13.3 and it keeps failing\n",
