  "body": "*bug*\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI have a hook that is supposed to call a callback after a `setTimeout`. When I render a list of children with this hook, the callback behaves differently when its in a function component with `useState` than it does if its in a class component.\r\n\r\nTo see this in action, checkout the codesandbox below. The demo should show children components being added to the page and then after 2 seconds the child is mounted, it should be removed. Both the examples use the same child components, only difference is the parent component being a class vs functional component.\r\n[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/01yo61v6m0)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe function component should behave like the class component.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact v16.8.6\r\nLatest Chrome\r\n\r\nUnsure if this worked with previous versions of hooks.\r\n",
