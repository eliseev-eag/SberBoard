  "body": "Check out this fiddle, http://jsfiddle.net/JUbe3/1/\nLine 70 is the real puzzler\nIt suggests that when you \"select\" a message, that the Content's color should go red.\n- I can change the color just fine when I hit \"change color\" (which is state controlled)\n- I can't do it when I \"select a message\" (which is porp controlled and in my assumption should reload the entire component with new properties)\n\nI've tried removing any mention of this.state.color and only using this.props.color and things work as expected. I can change color when I select a message, however, obviously I cannot toggle the color using the link.\n\nI did also try setting the Content's state from the select function but that just resulted in errors.\n\nMaybe someone with a bit more experience knows a work around (which I would like to hear about) but I feel like this is intuitive and so should just work and thats why I've filed it as an issue.\n",
