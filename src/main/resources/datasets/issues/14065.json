  "body": "While testing some of our new APIs in DevTools, I noticed that the profiler (both the API and the DevTools visual profiler) reported invalid `actualDuration` and `treeBaseDuration` values when suspending.\r\n\r\nThe `treeBaseDuration` was incorrect for the fallback commit. It only included the fallback subtree duration, when it should also include the time spent rendering the hidden subtree.\r\n\r\nThe `actualDuration` value was incorrect for both the fallback commit _and_ the final, resolved commit. It didn't include time spent rendering the component that actually read from the cache (the one that threw).\r\n\r\n- [x] Fixed `treeBaseDuration` by propagating its value from the suspended tree to the `Fragment` React temporarily wraps around it when showing the fallback UI.\r\n- [x] Fixed `actualDuration` by recording elapsed profiler time in the event of an error.\r\n- [x] Fixed `actualDuration` in concurrent mode by propagating the time spent rendering the suspending component to its parent.\r\n\r\nAlso updated `ReactSuspensePlaceholder-test.internal` to cover these new cases.",
