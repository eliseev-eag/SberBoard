  "body": "Was talking with @paulshen about ref behavior.\n\nSee http://jsfiddle.net/XTjeU/\n\nWhen you have a ref to a component and it's not rendered into the DOM the ref never gets attached to the owner. I would expect that `this.refs.whatever` would return a valid unmounted React component and that `getDOMNode()` would throw as it does on any unmounted component.\n",
