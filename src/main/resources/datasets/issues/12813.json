  "body": "Fixes `Unexpected object passed to ReactTestInstance constructor (tag: 10)` when reading `.parent` of test instances whose parents are fragments. We currently skip fragments and similar nodes when reading children, so I made the `parent` getter also skip over them.\r\n\r\nI got rid of the `switch` because we already have a whitelist of node types that we want to materialize. I’m just reusing that now so we don’t have to remember to keep this logic in sync.\r\n\r\nAdded some test coverage.",
