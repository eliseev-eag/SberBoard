  "body": "I implemented this by checking for `type=\"text/jsx;harmony\"`, since this has a bit of a cleaner implementation rather than parsing a JSON object out of a data attribute. If in the future there are other options to pass, it would make sense to move to a system like that.\n\nAlong with adding support, there is also a new example added that's the basic-jsx example with harmony syntax. Feedback on implementation totally welcome! :smile: \n",
