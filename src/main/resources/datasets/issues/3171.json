  "body": "## Warn if accessing .type on a factory\n\nThis was an important convenience as an upgrade path but shouldn't be necessary if you're using best-practice of calling createFactory in the consuming component.\n## Warn if using Maps as children\n\nWe're not sure if this is the way we want to support this API. It creates two ways of doing things. It may conflict with a model that lazily flattens all children into iterable flat lists.\n\nIt is convenient to avoid needing to explicitly redefine the key of Maps. However, this use case isn't as common as having an iterable where the key is on the value, not the key.\n\nI'm also not comfortable with the feature testing that we're doing. It seems potentially fragile.\n\nWe still support other iterables though.\n\ncc @leebyron \n## Warn if getDOMNode or isMounted is accessed in render\n\nThis is an anti-pattern that can be easily avoided by putting the logic in componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate instead.\n\nOtherwise creates a dependency on stale data inside render without enforcing a two-pass render.\n",
