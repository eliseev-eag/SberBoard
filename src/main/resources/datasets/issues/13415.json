This may lead to subtle reconciliation issues. Try rendering into a container element created for your app.\r\nBut if I'm creating a whole website, according to:\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure\r\nIt is better to have the `<header>` `<main>` `<footer>` elements, and these elements are said to be better directly under body\r\n\r\nFor example, it says:\r\n`<main>` is for content unique to this page. Use `<main>` only once per page, and put it directly inside `<body>.` Ideally this shouldn't be nested within other elements.\r\n\r\nSo I think this is a common case to replace the whole content of the `<body>`\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nMaybe remove the warning?\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\"react-dom\": \"^16.3.0\",",
