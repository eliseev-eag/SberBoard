  "body": "Adds two regression tests (one for profiler stack and one for context stack). Also fixes the bug.\r\n\r\nThe bug was caused by a structure like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    </Provider>\r\n  </div>\r\n</errorInCompletePhase>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe forgot to update `nextUnitOfWork` (see the fix in the last commit). So it was still pointing at `Provider` when `errorInCompletePhase` threw. Normally we would update it right after so it wouldn't be noticeable, but in case of exception its value at the moment of throwing matters.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we would try to unwind from `Provider` (rather than from `errorInCompletePhase`), and thus pop the `Provider` twice. It has already been popped at the beginning of the complete phase.\r\n\r\nThis was easy to miss because a throwing complete phase is uncommon. But it can happen in host configs (e.g. RN nesting or DOM invalid style invariants).\r\n\r\nI verified this fixes the original internal issue too.",
