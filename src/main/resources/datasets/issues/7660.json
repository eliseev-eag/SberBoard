  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nbug\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\nWhen using `ReactDOM.render` checkboxes with jsx attribute `checked={null}` will have a `checked` value from their DOM element of `false`. When using `TestUtils` and `TestUtils.Simulate` the same configuration above for `checked={null}` will result in `checkboxElm.checked` to be `true`.\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem\n\ndemo here https://jsbin.com/ciwavowoqe/1/edit?html,js,console,output\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nexpected behavior is that TestUtils would mimic actual DOM fragment, i.e. jsx property `checked={null}` results in `someCheckboxElm.checked` to be `false`\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\nThis worked in `15.1.0` but stopped working in >= `15.2.0`\n",
