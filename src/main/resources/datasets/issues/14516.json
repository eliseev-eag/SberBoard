Delete package-lock.json (not package.json!) and/or yarn.lock in your project folder.\r\n  2. Delete node_modules in your project folder.\r\n  3. Remove \"babel-eslint\" from dependencies and/or devDependencies in the package.json file in your project folder.\r\n  4. Run npm install or yarn, depending on the package manager you use.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, this should be enough to fix the problem.\r\nIf this has not helped, there are a few other things you can try:\r\n\r\n  5. If you used npm, install yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/) and repeat the above steps with it instead.\r\n     This may help because npm has known issues with package hoisting which may get resolved in future versions.\r\n\r\n  6. Check if C:\\Users\\chawki\\node_modules\\babel-eslint is outside your project directory.\r\n     For example, you might have accidentally installed something in your home folder.\r\n\r\n  7. Try running npm ls babel-eslint in your project folder.\r\n     This will tell you which other package (apart from the expected react-scripts) installed babel-eslint.\r\n\r\nIf nothing else helps, add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to an .env file in your project.\r\nThat would permanently disable this preflight check in case you want to proceed anyway.\r\n\r\nP.S. We know this message is long but please read the steps above :-) We hope you find them helpful!\r\n\r\nnpm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE\r\nnpm ERR! errno 1\r\nnpm ERR! song@0.1.0 start: `react-scripts start`\r\nnpm ERR!
