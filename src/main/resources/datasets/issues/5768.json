  "body": "Hello React team. Due to the way `React` injects its dependencies (notably the Component one), one cannot use two different renderers in a node.js scripts. Let's say, for instance, that I need to use both [`react-blessed`](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/react-blessed) and `react-dom/server` because I display a nice CLI interface and then render some html after a HTTP request, this will crash because the second renderer will override the first's one dependencies.\n\nIs there a solution I would have overlooked here?\n\nRelated to Yomguithereal/react-blessed#43.\n",
