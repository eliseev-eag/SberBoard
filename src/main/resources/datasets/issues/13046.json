  "body": "I think we should start moving away from using `fbjs`. We already trail on a branch behind master, and it contains dependencies we don't need for our packages (including `core-js`!):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/fbjs/blob/fbjs-0.8.x/package.json#L63-L69\r\n\r\nIt didn't really bring much benefit wrt bug fixes to the underlying utilities either.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I'm inlining the functions that are relatively easy to fix. That also helped discover some indirection (although I didn't dare to remove all of it).\r\n\r\nI didn't touch `invariant` / `warning` because that's more involved, although should still be totally doable.\r\nWill look at them in follow-ups.\r\n\r\nAlso didn't touch `emptyFunction` (too many callsites) and `emptyObject` (we unfortunately rely on its \"sharing\" semantics in one place, will need to look at it in more detail).",
