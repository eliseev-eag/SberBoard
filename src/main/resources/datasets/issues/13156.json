  "body": "Resolves issue #13148\r\n\r\nThis is an unobservable change to all but the (under development) DevTools Profiler plugin. It is being done so that the plugin can safely feature detect a version of React that supports it. The profiler API has existed since the 16.4.0 release, but it did not properly work with the DevTools plugin prior to PR #13058.\r\n\r\nI chose to rename \"time\" to \"duration\" because it's more descriptive of what the field contains. That being said, the terms \"actual duration\" and \"base duration\" are pretty vague. If anyone has suggestions for better namesâ€“ this is the best time to bikeshed about them.",
