Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.

Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nFirefox, Chrome, Edge (77x on mac) with React 16.9.0 both fail to run `useEffect` on this iFrame\r\nSafari with React 16.9.0: Does run the `useEffect` on this iFrame\r\nIE (windows or 11): unknown\r\n",
