  "body": "```   \r\n \"react\": \"^16.2.0\",\r\n \"react-dom\": \"^16.2.0\"\r\n```\r\nJust upgraded to react 16 from 15.0.2, and using `event currentTarget.value` will give me undefined. Basically I have a stateless child component that will fire the callback when it's clicked, and will pass an extra params through DOM API value field \r\n```\r\n <a className=\"btn-sm\" onClick={onDelete} value={data}>\r\n   <i className=\"fa fa-trash\" aria-hidden=\"true\" />\r\n </a>\r\n```\r\nAnd in my parent component the callback is as follows, the param is not accessible in 16 anymore\r\n```\r\n  onDelete(event) {\r\n    const data = event.currentTarget.value;  //works in react 15.0.2, but returns undefined in 16\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nSo I looked into the event that is being returned in both versions of React, looks like in 16 the `_dispatchInstances` is a `FiberNode`, whereas in 15 is a `ReactDOMComponent`\r\n![screenshot from 2018-02-23 10 44 44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15480446/36602727-c3204d64-1886-11e8-9c0e-cf9e97751412.png)\r\nReact 16\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2018-02-23 10 46 44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15480446/36602775-dcf1cbfa-1886-11e8-810c-d177a7de8120.png)\r\nReact 15\r\n\r\nIs this an intentional change? If so, how do I go about passing this params to the callback? I don't really want to use arrow functions since that affects the performance",
