  "body": "Creating this issue to get guidance on how to experiment with the new Hot Reloading functionality in React with ClojureScript.\r\n\r\nIn ClojureScript, we typically try to avoid webpack and other modern JS bundlers, and instead leverage a homegrown ClojureScript -> JS compiler, which outputs Google Closure-compatible JS. The code is then passed through the Google Closure Compiler to do advanced optimizations and bundling. We have also built some plumbing to interop with most NPM libs assuming they use fairly standard CJS or ESM.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea I will be experimenting with is outputting the necessary calls to React’s hot loading mechanism via a normal CLJS macro, analyzing the body of a function component for any `useX` calls at compile-time.\r\n\r\nBased on what @gaearon told me on twitter, it sounds like I will currently need to build from master. I think that the easiest way for me to consume this in a CLJS project would be to build React in a way such that I can consume it just like an NPM module, either via `npm link` or installing it directly in node_modules, to avoid having to faff about too much with Google Closure and React compatibility / externs / etc. Including it directly on the page as a JS file would be the next best thing, it will just require some more work on my end to ensure it works the same as when a user installs it via NPM.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to testing things out. If it’s helpful, I will report back here any issues I run into. Thanks!",
