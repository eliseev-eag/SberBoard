  "body": "React binds touchmove, touchstart, touchend, touchcancel and wheel handlers to the document. When the user tries to scroll the browser needs to execute these event handlers to ensure event.preventDefault() was not called. This means scrolling will stall while JavaScript is executing.\n\nChrome has a fast-path that checks whether the coordinate where the touch event happens has touch listeners (https://plus.google.com/+RickByers/posts/cmzrtyBYPQc). If there are no listeners Chrome can allow the scroll to happen even if the main thread is blocked on JavaScript. \n\nWe should bind our listeners for these events directly to the node which requires it. That event handler can then dispatch the event to the standard React top level event system. Then it will bubble/capture just like everything else and be visible to all event plugins.\n",
