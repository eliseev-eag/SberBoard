  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nfeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\n- Currently react's size (v15.4.2: react.min.js 20.7KB compressed, react-dom.min.js 121KB compressed) is about 140KB after compression, which is still a pain point for mobile web situation.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n- I've heard that [React implement its own event dispatching and bubbling, it normalizes common events across browsers so that you don't need to worry as much about it.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19807946/why-is-reacts-filesize-so-big-given-its-small-api), which maybe make a huge contribution to react's size. So I'm wondering if it's possible or already enabled for react to combine with [babel-preset-env](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env) to provide ability for smaller production bundle size?\r\n- For example in our team in China, we mainly focus on iOS Safari & Android Browser & Hybrid WebViews in iOS & Android, which of those are based on webkit kernel, so any polyfill for IE/Edge, Opera, Firefox or other desktop browsers is unnecessary for our production codes. If those polyfills could be stripped out, that should make our final production codes much smaller.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n- React@15.4.2",
