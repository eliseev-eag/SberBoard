Follow the steps for adding the linting rules outlined on the [Rules of Hooks page](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html).\r\n2. Create a plain JS function with a name that begins with `use`, e.g. `useFoo`. Call this function from within another plain JS function, e.g. `testFoo`.\r\n    ```js\r\n    function useFoo() {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function testFoo() {\r\n      useFoo();\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n3. The linter will complain:\r\n     ```\r\n     React Hook \"useFoo\" is called in function \"testFoo\" which is neither a React function component or a custom React Hook function  react-hooks/rules-of-hooks\r\n     ```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIdeally, the rule would ignore functions that begin with `use` but are not React Hooks.",
