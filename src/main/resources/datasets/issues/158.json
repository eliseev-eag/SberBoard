  "body": "Right now JSX only supports desugaring for value interpolation <Module key={'value'}>. Would be nice to support interpolation for the module name and keys. E4X supports those interpolations.\n\nI would also really like to support interpolation for arbitrary props. This would allow us to get rid of this.transferPropsTo which is a really unfortunate API in my mind.\n\n```\n<Module {this.props} overridenProp=\"vjeux\" />\n```\n",
