  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen null is returned in setState updater, callback is invoked.\r\n`\r\nthis.setState((prevState) => null, callback);\r\n`\r\nExample (see console):\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/set-state-callback\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nWhen state is not updated callback should not be invoked.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n^16.0.0\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about it? First of all we can consider callback what invokes after every setState. On the other side we can consider it as callback invoked only after state change. In my opinion second option is more handy because if I want to invoke callback with some job, I usually need to do something when state changed.",
