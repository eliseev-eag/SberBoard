Can only update a mounted or mounting component.\r\n    This usually means you called setState, replaceState,\r\n    or forceUpdate on an unmounted component. This is a no-op\r\n\r\n2.  %s.componentWillReceiveProps(): Assigning directly to\r\n    this.state is deprecated (except inside a component's\r\n    constructor). Use setState instead.'\r\n\r\n3.  An update (setState, replaceState, or forceUpdate) was scheduled\r\n    from inside an update function. Update functions should be pure,\r\n    with zero side-effects. Consider using componentDidUpdate or a\r\n    callback.\r\n\r\n4.  setState(...): Cannot call setState() inside getChildContext()\r\n\r\n@gaearon  Let me know if it looks ok to you",
