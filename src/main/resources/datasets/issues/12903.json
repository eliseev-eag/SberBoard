  "body": "Hello, I have the following problem and was wondering if this is a documentation issue, or if react doesn't support this behavior.\r\nLet's say you have the following HTML:\r\n```HTML\r\n<span onMouseDown=bound clearValue> /* onMouseDown appears to be a prop */\r\n</span>\r\n```\r\nAnd you have a library that allows you to specify the child of the `span` node. Namely, passing in the following function to the library\r\n```JavaScript\r\nspanChildRenderer = () => {\r\n    return <div ref = (element) => this.spanRef = element.parentNode;\r\n};\r\n```\r\nwould render the following:\r\n```HTML\r\n<span ...>\r\n    <div ...>\r\n    </div>\r\n</span>\r\n```\r\nNow, when I use the following, the click event isn't happening:\r\n```JavaScript\r\nthis.spanRef.click()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tried many variations of the above (tried using `element.parentElement` instead of `element.parentNode`; the behavior didn't change, so I'm not sure the two attributes are different anymore).\r\n\r\nSo the problem is inability to refer to the react prop using the ref.\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n__If anything in the explanation above is confusing/under-clarified, please let me know.__",
