  "body": "This is not a feature request or a bug report, but more of a question regarding React. \r\n\r\nI am new to using custom hooks. I don't know if anyone has done this before; I don't even know what this pattern is called, or what to search for. I have a child component and parent component. The parent contains many, many different children. I don't want to keep all of the data in the parent as it would became very unmaintainable very fast. IMHO, global stores also would eventually became unmaintainable. I am currently looking for an alternative that may prove to be cleaner than current solutions. \r\n\r\nI have an idea to segregate the data responsibility to children instead of the keeping all of the data in the parent. My idea is show below. \r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n// useChild.js\r\nconst useChild = () => {\r\n  const [data, setData] = useState(0);\r\n  \r\n  const saveData = () => sendDataToSaveOnRemoteAPI(data);\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    setData(fetchDataFromRemoteAPI());\r\n  }, []);\r\n\r\n  const Child = <Display data={data} />\r\n\r\n  return { Child, saveData }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n// Parent.js\r\nconst Parent = () => {\r\n  const { Child, saveData } = useChild();\r\n  const { AnotherChild, saveAnotherData } = useAnotherChild();\r\n\r\n  const saveAll = () => {\r\n    saveData();\r\n    saveAnotherData();\r\n  };\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <Child />\r\n      <AnotherChild />\r\n      <SaveButton onClick={saveAll} />\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo me, it looks kinda clean that data responsibility is remove from the parent. The logical flow also looks clean in my opinion; when the `SaveButton` is clicked, `Child` will save the data it is responsible for. The downside may be that this is contradictory to what has always been done in React land. I suppose that normally we would keep all the data in the Parent or other state management solutions and Child might be a stateless component, etc. \r\n\r\nIs this pattern documented anywhere? Is this pattern recommended? ",
