  "body": "We might later want to move portal creation to `React` API that would be renderer-agnostic and work across renderers but it's likely that it will be a superset of the current API.\r\n\r\nSo we might as well call the current API \"stable\". Especially because it's the only migration path for top-level render returning `null` inside a batch in 16.\r\n\r\nSee individual commits. I added validation because otherwise you get a very confusing error when you pass something else. Also helps us make it clear it's currently not supported by SSR.\r\n\r\nOpen question: what happens if you do `{isClient && ReactDOM.createPortal(...)}`? Does it cause a mismatch on initial render? I don't know. Worth checking.",
