  "body": "Hi! I just had a couple of questions/requests regarding the tutorial.\r\n\r\n1. In the Board's render function (snippets in question show below), while later removed, winner and status both make use of this.state.[value]; should this instead be this.prop.[value]? I understand that it is removed later on, but as I'm trying to follow along and understand the code, this seemed inconsistent.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst winner = calculateWinner(this.state.squares);\r\n...\r\nstatus = 'Next player: ' + (this.state.xIsNext ? 'X' : 'O');\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. In the jumpTo function of the Game class, the discussion reads, \"_We set xIsNext to true if the index of the move number is an even number_,\" but then the code given reads ```xIsNext: (step % 2) ? false : true,```. Shouldn’t the line read “_We set xIsNext to true if the index of the move number is an odd number._”?\r\n\r\nThank you!",
