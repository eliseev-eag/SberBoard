  "body": "This fixes #6742. It was caused by a composite changing from rendering `null` to rendering a native component. We don’t register the empty components in the devtool (as they are a temporary implementation detail), but we used to report them in some events, which caused the aggregation code to fail.\n\nI fixed the problem and added a few remedies for the future:\n1. Tests for these particular cases.\n2. `ReactPerf` tests now call all aggregation methods just in case so if they throw, the tests will fail.\n3. We now warn if the `debugID` passed to devtools is zero. We use zero for implementation details like TopLevelWrapper and empty components, and we don’t want to leak information about them.\n4. Fixed a few remaining callsites that passed zero or undefined (mostly in tests).\n\nReviewers: @sebmarkbage @spicyj \n",
