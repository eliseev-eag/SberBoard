  "body": "This is regarding the the use of hydrate in Next.js.\r\nWe use the same render code base to render the initial SSR'ed version and client side generated renders. (When a user clicked on a link)\r\n\r\nSo, here's my question. Is it okay to use `ReactDom.hydrate()` in all cases. \r\n> Here we assume, it'll fallback to `ReactDom.render()` if it cannot hydrate.\r\n\r\nBut I was not sure of this. So, I have a solution for this. (See: https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/3012)\r\n\r\nIs it makes sense to do the above check(in the PR)?",
