  "body": "Use the special `Idle` expiration time for updates that are triggered at Scheduler's `IdlePriority`, instead of `Never`.\r\n\r\nThe key difference between Idle and Never¹ is that Never work can be committed in an inconsistent state without tearing the UI. The main example is offscreen content, like a hidden subtree.\r\n\r\n¹ \"Never\" isn't the best name. I originally called it that because it \"never\" expires, but neither does Idle. Since it's mostly used for offscreen subtrees, we could call it \"Offscreen.\" However, it's also used for dehydrated Suspense boundaries, which are inconsistent in the sense that they haven't finished yet, but aren't visibly inconsistent because the server rendered HTML matches what the hydrated tree would look like.",
