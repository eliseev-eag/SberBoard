  "body": "I would like to report my [bug #2803](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/2803#issuecomment-68625392) again please, because it was closed, and @gaearon said \"re-open it if it's still a problem.\"\r\n\r\nAs I currently understand it, React is incorrectly handling a common case in the construction of `<select>`s.  It is fairly normal to create a `<select>` where the first element is disabled, but remains pre-selected.\r\n\r\n[React should render this case, but instead renders the first deselected control](https://stonecypher.github.io/is_react_2803_still_a_problem/index2.html).  \r\n\r\nI attempted to fix this by forcing the selection.  The normal approach is to set `selected` on the relevant `<option>`, but React disallows this, preferring a novel property `defaultValue` on the `<select>` instead, mimicing a first-write version of the `<select>` property `value`.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to set `defaultValue`, [what you set is ignored](https://stonecypher.github.io/is_react_2803_still_a_problem/index3.html) (it may be the case that [defaultValue is broken on select](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11099).)  \r\n\r\nReact's inability to render a disabled `<option>` as either the default or selected initial has been present since at least sometime mid-version-14, which is when I first found it.  I first documented it in 15.3.1 in January 2015, because prior to then it was faster to tell the core devs on IRC.  I do not know how far it goes back past mid-r14.",
