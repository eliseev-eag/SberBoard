  "body": "I don't like use `Webpack`, lots of coders don't use `Webpack` in China. We have a more ease-to-use tool called [fis3](http://fis.baidu.com/fis3/api/index.html). \r\nThe problem is that `fis` parse the file-dependencies by checking keywords like `require()`,`require.async()` . But right now react added codes like these\r\n `if ('development' === 'production') {\r\n    module.exports = require('node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.production.min');} \r\nelse {\r\n    module.exports = require('node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development');\r\n  }`.\r\n\r\nThen `fis` will the get the result, the current file rely on the `production` and `development` files. But we only need one of the them.\r\nSo can u guys please make it a agnostic to the environment. let the tools work on that.\r\n",
