  "body": "I just replaced some react components that where defined using es6 classes and I am now getting warnings about my react stateless component (that are just fuction) not being a ReactNode.\n\n```\nWarning: Failed propType: Invalid prop `Loader` supplied to `Picture`, expected a ReactNode.\n```\n\nI were validating some components using `React.PropTypes.node`, but now I need to use `PropTypes.oneOfType([ PropTypes.node, PropTypes.func ])` which seems a bit long to say \"this can be anything that can be rendered as a component\" (which is what `ProTypes.node` is supposed to cover right?).\n\nFrom the doc\n\n``` js\n    // Anything that can be rendered: numbers, strings, elements or an array\n    // (or fragment) containing these types.\n    optionalNode: React.PropTypes.node,\n```\n\nMaybe `func` should be added? Or is there any reason why `node` doesn't handle `func` as well?\n",
