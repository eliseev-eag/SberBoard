  "body": "I set up a project and run it. \nIt says required support `v7:23.0.1` . I didn't installed `v7:23.0.1`, but I installed`v7:22.0.1`. And I don't want to use `v7:22.0.1` for some reason. \n\nSo I changed `android/app/build.gradle` file's dependencies line \n\n> compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.0.1'\n\nto \n\n> compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:22.0.1'\n\nThis works usually in normal android projects. But didn't in react-native project. \n\n> Could not find com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.0.1.\n\nThe error log seems a bit difference than before. It says:\n\n> Required by:\n>         AwesomeProject:app:unspecified > com.facebook.react:react-native:0.12.0\n\nHow could I change the dependencies' support version of com.facebook.react:react-native:0.12.0  to `v7:22.0.1` \nor in other words, How Can I Change the Dependencies' Support Version to a My Version\n\nI have read the most of related issues. But they do not work for me.\nI have read the [page of android setup](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/android-setup.html) but it dose not work for me\nI have surely installed Android Support Repository and Android Support Library and Google Repository\n\nupdate:\n\nAnother reason I ask this question is:\nWhen some day, google releases a support 'v7:24.0.1' , and I want to use it, but `com.facebook.react:react-native:0.12.0` this package still requires 'v7:23.0.1'. How could I make the project run perfectly? \n\nThank you.\n\nupdate:\n\nI reboot by Mac and things changed. But still not works.\nout put:\n\n> No resource found that matches the given name 'android:Widget.Material.Button.Colored'.\n",
