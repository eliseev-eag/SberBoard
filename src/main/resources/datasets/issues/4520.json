  "body": "It seems that if you're conditionally rendering between two elements then they can't have a different root node, for example switching between an input and a div. In order to get around the issue you have to wrap everything in a common container element for React to be able to handle it.\n\nSample plunkr is [here](http://plnkr.co/edit/uXXZCctefi4IH22SCtPA?p=preview) which demonstrates the behavior. I'd expect in this case it to switch between showing 'Test' and 'Test 2' when activating the checkbox, instead it ends up duplicating the node.\n\nInterestingly I don't get any errors in this simplified test case, in a more complex app React complains about two unrelated nodes sharing the same React id after activating the checkbox. \n",
