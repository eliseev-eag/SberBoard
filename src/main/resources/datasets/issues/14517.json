  "body": "Before Hooks, Context is unique method provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.\r\n\r\nBut on nearby future, we can use Custom Hooks with `useState()`. It might be imported any components regardless its tree. Then, Do still we need Context for new react application? I understand React must provide backward compatibility so React should have `useContext()` Hooks.\r\nHowever I can't think about where I should use Context in my app when I start using `useState()` expect for using library uses Context as API.\r\n\r\nPlease help me for understanding hooks in detail.
