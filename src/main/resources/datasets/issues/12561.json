  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nbug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nSubsequent `ReactDOM.render` calls with **the same** tree are causing Consumers to rerender even if provided value is static & has the same reference (or is static primitive type) - whereas normal rerender (caused i.e. by `setState`) doesn't cause this.\r\n\r\nSituation occurs when there is an update blocker between Provider & Consumer.\r\n\r\n@thysultan provided excellent demo for this - https://codesandbox.io/s/4qo2mw42r4\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThose calls should behave the same as rerenders caused by `setState`. Tree is correctly reconciled and not recreated from scratch, so it's only logical to me that those nested rerenders should be avoided.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nreact@16.3",
