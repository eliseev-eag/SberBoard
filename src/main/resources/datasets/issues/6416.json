  "body": "From https://github.com/gaearon/babel-plugin-react-transform:\n\n\"The goal is to eventually kill this technology in favor of less hacky technologies baked into React.\"\n\nI'm running into a problem where I want to be able to transform components regardless of Babel - i.e., components that may or may not be touched by Babel because they're either already transpiled, a dependency within `node_modules`, etc.\n\nAnd official way to transform _all_ components would solve this problem immediately and could enable some incredibly useful functionality in the realm of reusability, extensibility, and managing application state via context.\n\nI'm curious as to whether or not anyone has put any \"official\" thought towards this or if you'd be willing to accept a pull request for it.\n",
