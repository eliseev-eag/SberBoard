  "body": "Related (closed) issue: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/65\n\nI'm not sure whether this is considered a bug or if it's working as intended, but I'll at least throw in a vote that the behavior is unexpected.  Given the following example:\n\n``` jsx\nvar Test = React.createClass({\n  render: function() {\n    return (\n      <p>\n        Demonstration of <span>unexpected</span>\n        whitespace handling in\n        <span>ReactJS</span>.\n      </p>\n    );\n  }\n});\n\nReact.render(<Test />, document.body)\n```\n\n[[Demonstration on jsbin](http://jsbin.com/jecawenene/edit?js,output)].\n\nI would suggest that the expected rendered output of the above component would be:\n\n```\nDemonstration of unexpected whitespace handling in ReactJS.\n```\n\nWhereas the actual output is:\n\n```\nDemonstration of unexpectedwhitespace handling inReactJS.\n```\n\n(No whitespace between \"unexpected\" and \"whitespace\" or between \"in\" and \"ReactJS\").\n\nI would consider this unexpected for two primary reasons:\n- It's inconsistent with HTML's handling of whitespace.\n- Removing the `<span>` tags (but leaving newlines and indentations unchanged) causes whitespace to be preserved.\n\nIf this is simply a bug, then I suppose there's no need to belabor the point. If not, is there some rationale for leading/trailing tags behaving different than leading/trailing plain text?\n\nThanks!\n",
