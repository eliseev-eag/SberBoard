  "body": "After playing with a new way of sync props & state I've found a strange behaviour of `getDerivedStateFromProps`. If you want to call another static method you need to use a component's name rather `this`(which is undefined). According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/static#Calling_static_methods) calling a static methods from another static method by `this` is fine. Maybe it's an expected flow, so I guess a note in docs will be fine. If not here's a playground to reproduce this case https://codesandbox.io/s/23w6x19v1p  ",
