A future concrete use case could be if you would need to call render internally from react-conciler for some dependency analytics or similar, wouldn't it be great if the thrown thenable didn't start off it's side effect until 'then' is actually called?\r\n\r\nIf so, your own reference libraries, like react-cache could be adjusted to not calling 'then()' on given thenable, but instead throw a suspender that lazily would call given thenable when framework calls suspender.then().\r\n\r\nJust a thought that I couldn't get out of my mind for a while.\r\n",
