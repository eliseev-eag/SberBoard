  "body": "This PR addresses https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10616.\r\n\r\nFrom the snippet mentioned in the issue, the expected behavior is indeed to log the array of elements, instead of only the first element. \r\n\r\nIn addition to that, there were some inconsistencies with the output generated by the different component types. For example, `<HostComponent>.rendered` will always be an array, while `<FunctionalComponent>.rendered` will be an object (which by the way, is what led to the issue). In order to make the response more predictable, `<Component>.rendered` will always return an array, or `null`.\r\n\r\nTests :white_check_mark:\r\nLinting :white_check_mark:\r\nFlow :white_check_mark:\r\n\r\n",
