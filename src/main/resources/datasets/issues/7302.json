  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nEnhancement\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\nElement type checker is not as informative as the other ones.\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nIt would be nice to provide the actual type of the prop passed similarly to other type checkers. I.e., instead of \n\n> Invalid prop `Prop` supplied to `Component`, expected a single ReactElement.\n\nsay\n\n> Invalid prop `Prop` of type `type` supplied to `Component`, expected a single ReactElement.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\nSeeing this on 15.2.1 but I think it's also applicable to previous versions.\n\nI know the general intention is to move away from prop types, but if there isn't a specific reason for the current behavior I can look into making this more pretty.\n",
