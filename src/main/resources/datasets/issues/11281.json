  "body": "This addresses https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11280.\r\n\r\nWe forbid `TestUtils` and `ShallowRenderer` from bundling the reconciler code.\r\n\r\nThe build breaks since they depend on some Fiber modules. However those modules happen to be stateless helpers. So I move those to `shared` acknowledging their nature (just like `ReactTypeOfWork` already lives there).\r\n\r\nWe can (and maybe will need to) fix this in a different way by moving them to the reconciler and making them exports on it. Since third-party renderers might need them anyway.\r\n\r\nHowever this is a reasonable solution while we’re untangling dependencies. Again, it doesn’t change how it works—just formally encodes what we already do.\r\n\r\nI added some todos for server dependencies on reconciler modules. Should be easy follow up fix.",
