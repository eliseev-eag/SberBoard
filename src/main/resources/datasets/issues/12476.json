Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/00lm97zrjn\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI think `event.button` should default to `0` because that means \"left click\". Some libraries like react-router [rely on this](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/5342c9fd58c85fd0b6272a5f12dcedab7416c0fe/packages/react-router-dom/modules/Link.js#L40). Maybe _they_ should default to `0`, not React? ReactTraining/react-router#1534\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about earlier versions, but I'm getting this behavior in `react-dom@16.2.0`.",
