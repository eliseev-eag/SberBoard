When the addon tries to load, it loads from `'self'` as opposed to `http://localhost:8002`. `'self'` shows up in the policy when I look at the headers themselves on a request, which tells me I got the CSP serving correctly to FF.)\r\n\r\nReact will start up in the dev tools, but it will never connect to my react web app. (It just says \"Looking for React...\")\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar.**\r\nInstall the Firefox React dev plugin and visit http://24.85.23.206:8002/admin-panel, if I've left my development machine running. Note the CSP violation in the dev console.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe addon should work if `self` is an allowed script-src. Indeed, it _should_ work whatever my CSP is.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact plugin 0.15.3 (from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)\r\nFirefox 45.3 is affected.\r\nOS: Debian 8\r\n",
