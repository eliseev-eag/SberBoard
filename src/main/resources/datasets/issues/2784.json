  "body": "Currently there is no hook that would allow us to set attributes on the node before it's injected into a document. Which is unfortunate as there are some attributes in the wild that take effect only before element is injected into a document.\n\nTo workaround this I'm forced to replacing react injected nodes with clones on `componentDidMount`\nhttps://github.com/Gozala/firefox.html/blob/react/js/element.js#L57-L61\n\nIt would be great if react could expose node that will be inserted during `componentWillMount` or added another hook where node will be provided.\n",
