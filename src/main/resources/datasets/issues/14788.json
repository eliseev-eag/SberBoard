It used to work in 16.8.0-alpha.1 with no issues.\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/3ywxy8mp0q\r\n\r\nAs soon as I updated to 16.8.0, it stopped rendering when the time is changed.  In the tick() function I see that the time gets updated, but this doesn't cause rerender for some reason.\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/m4zqyz0pkp\r\n\r\nAny ideas why this happens?\r\nPlease let me know if any additional details are required.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!
