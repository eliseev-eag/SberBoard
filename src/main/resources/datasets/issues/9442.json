  "body": "Turns out I was incorrect in my initial setup of Circle and if we want to tell Circle not to try to build the `gh-pages` branch we need to do it in that branch. So I just setup a new `circle.yml` here that will get built into that branch when docs get built. I did a quick test to confirm that the file does get built into the branch by running the `build_gh_pages.sh` script (minus the `push` part)\r\n\r\nFrom [the docs](https://circleci.com/docs/1.0/configuration/#branches):\r\n> `circle.yml` is per-branch configuration file, and the branch ignore list in one branch will only affect that branch and no other one.\r\n\r\n",
