  "body": "At Mozilla, our testing infrastructure for Firefox forces us to use a \"production\" build of Firefox that represents an exact build of Nightly that a user would use. The problem with this and that it uses a production version of React, which does _not_ have TestUtils included, and we need that to run our JS tests.\n\nIs there any reason other than JS code size that it is only included in the dev version? If we just forcefully include `TestUtils` with our production version of React, will that work? I'm fine with doing a custom build for that.\n\nRight now we had to switch to only use the dev version but I want to fix this ASAP.\n",
