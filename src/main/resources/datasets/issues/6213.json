  "body": "Previously, the whitelist of supported SVG attributes was very incomplete.  Rather than constantly playing catch up with the SVG attributes whitelist, we decided it would be better to pass all attributes directly through.  For example, the `strokeWidth` attribute is now deprecated in favor of the `stroke-width` attribute (the \"standard\" attribute for SVG elements).\n\nIt would be good if we had a codemod to help SVG users migrate to v15.  It can rewrite all the known attributes (including `className`->`class` for SVG elements).\n",
