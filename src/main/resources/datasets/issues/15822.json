  "body": "I am new to react native and I am trying to implement Redux in my application.  React native throwing error while using connect function from react-redux as follows.\r\n\r\n`export default connect()(MyComponent);` \r\n\r\nI checked all 3 options and I am not breaking any:\r\n1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM)\r\n2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks(Not sure)\r\n3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app\r\n\r\n\r\nversion of dependancies listed below:\r\n\r\n\"react\": \"^16.8.6\",\r\n    \"react-dom\": \"^16.8.6\",\r\n    \"react-native\": \"0.57.7\",\r\n    \"react-native-elements\": \"^0.19.1\",\r\n    \"react-native-geocoding\": \"^0.3.0\",\r\n    \"react-native-gesture-handler\": \"^1.0.12\",\r\n    \"react-native-maps\": \"https://github.com/react-community/react-native-maps.git\",\r\n    \"react-native-modal\": \"^9.0.0\",\r\n    \"react-native-router-flux\": \"^4.0.6\",\r\n    \"react-native-size-matters\": \"^0.1.4\",\r\n    \"react-native-super-grid\": \"^3.0.4\",\r\n    \"react-native-vector-icons\": \"^4.6.0\",\r\n    \"react-navigation\": \"^3.0.9\",\r\n    \"react-redux\": \"^7.0.3\",\r\n    \"redux\": \"^4.0.1\",\r\n    \"redux-logger\": \"^3.0.6\"\r\n\r\nError disappear when I remove connect().
