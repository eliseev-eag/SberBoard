  "body": "Per the discussion from React 16 RC, [I was asked to open a separate issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10294#issuecomment-319475548) regarding opening up the event system in React. We currently use: \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nrequire(\"react-dom/lib/EventPluginUtils\").executeDispatchesInOrder\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this disappeared in React 16, which is blocking our ability to upgrade to it.\r\n\r\nBasically we grab `executeDispatchesInOrder` in order to wrap it so a certain piece of code can fire afterward. I was asked [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10294#issuecomment-319480224) why we don't just wrap `addEventListener` instead, and at least at the time, I believe my experiments showed that this didn't work because React seemed to firing its internal synthetic events at a later time (possibly batching them? I don't know). If there is a new hacky way to do this same thing, I'm happy to do that and punt on this question.\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nDepends, certainly used to work, so in that sense a bug, but would require API creation perhaps, so maybe a feature?\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nNo access to event firing.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nSome way to inject code to fire after events fire.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16, solution existed in React 15 and down.\r\n",
