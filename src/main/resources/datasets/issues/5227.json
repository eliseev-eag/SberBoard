  "body": "hi,\n\ni have update to 0.14 version because i want to use a premade component which requires it. i've spent an hour more trying to debug why nothing renders, then i tried other components that worked, but they didn't render either.\n\nthen i googled and found that i need to require react-dom and ReactDOM.render\n\nbut this didn't help either. the render methods of all my components are not being called at all\n\nhow is that possible?\n",
