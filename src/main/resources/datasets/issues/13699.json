  "body": "**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWe use react-intl to do translations in our project. Since 16.5.0 release of react-dom we cannot use this anymore. `<option><FormattedMessage id=\"something\"></option>`.\r\n\r\nIf we use that snapshot tests don't fail(we use react-test-renderer). When u look on rendered html there is a string rendered in option tag.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nTests failing. If we have any react component in `option` tag we expected to [Object Object] to be rendered inside of option.\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nwe use create-react-app. it only occurs is test env. \r\nreact, react-dom, react-test-renderer 16.5.1\r\nreact-int 2.6.0\r\n",
