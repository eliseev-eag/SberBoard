The components with the method haven't been loaded yet, as It uses react-loadable, and is in a login component only. In chrome dev tools however, it stays a long time in a webpackerrormessage js file.\r\n\r\nJust found it weird, it runs on my iMac immediately, but previously not on my 2nd gen i5 with 12gb of ram laptop, until I changed this, it's a large codebase btw, but still some mighty performance impact for an error message. Just wanted a heads up, some folks out there who ignore eslint warnings ðŸ˜¬ until its time to clean up the app might just ignore this casually, i dunno.\r\n\r\nI only tested this on development, haven't tried doing a build with no sourcemaps to see if that is a problem too.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nTried doing some nested components with the lifecycle method in the sandbox, doesn't lag, so its probably with eslint-react?\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nShould have lagged with the aforementioned lifecycle method, but it probably doesnt since there's no eslint configured\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nThis is on react 16.5.0, eslint 5.6.1",
