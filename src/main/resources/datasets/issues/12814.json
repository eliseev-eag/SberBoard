It's possible this may be an issue with React Native, but I wanted to check here first incase my use of the forwardRef API is incorrect. The docs explain the intent of the API well, but the implementation was a little confusing to me (https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html#forwarding-refs-to-dom-components)\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe following code results in an error when executed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport React from 'react'\r\nimport { TextInput } from 'react-native'\r\n\r\nconst CustomInput = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {\r\n  return <TextInput {...props} ref={ref} />\r\n})\r\n\r\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return <CustomInput />\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error reported is:\r\n\r\n> \"Invariant Violation: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object.\r\n> Check the render method of 'App'\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16.3.2",
