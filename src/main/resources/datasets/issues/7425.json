  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\n\nüêõ\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\n\n`style` attribute with `radial-gradient` doesn't get updated when changing `extent-keyword` (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/radial-gradient). It does update for any other value, though.\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\n\nDemo: https://esnextb.in/?gist=d3b0b9c241975095b895108b59f8f213\n1. Open in Chrome or Safari\n2. Click on the \"closest-side\" button. CSS string changes but gradient remain the same.\n3. Click on the \"Update Position\" button. It will update `style` attribute of the DOM node for position _and_ extent keyword.\n\nChanging the value directly via Developer Tools does update it, so it must be the React-related bug.\n\nSee how it update the gradient when I change the position of it:\n\n![2016-08-04 at 15 25](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11071/17403442/0265ef86-5a58-11e6-8c91-4efaa09d6089.gif)\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n\nTry same steps in Firefox to see a proper behavior.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\nReproducible in 15.1.0 and 15.3.0\n",
