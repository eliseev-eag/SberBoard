Then [this condition](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/e1ff342bf7f451fb995e0ea2bfb10889deef022f/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L842) would never be true and we'd loop forever.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't affect other cases because we update `.return` in the loop. The top-level parent is just outside of the loop.",
