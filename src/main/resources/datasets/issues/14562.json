  "body": "Firstly, I'm sorry if opening an issue here it's the wrong place to ask that, but since it's very attached to the repository itself I raised it here as a \"meta-issue\".\r\n\r\nI'd like to know if there's a special reason why NPM releases aren't making it to the [Releases section](https://github.com/facebook/react/releases) of the repository here. I'm mainly talking about the latest `alpha` versions that include React Hooks. I noticed from NPM that a new `next` was available under `16.8.0-alpha.0` and I went to the repository here to understand what had changed from `16.7.0-alpha.2` that I was using, however, didn't find any mention of this release on the \"Releases\" section. I had to go through closed PRs to understand that #14555 was the PR that did the change and was published.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
