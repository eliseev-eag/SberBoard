  "body": "We have observed a peculiar behavior and we are unsure whether this is by design or an issue with the specific environment:\r\n\r\nbasically we have a React app rendering in a div included in a web container, and if we trigger a component local state change by calling setState then the whole of the web component page is refreshed, thus loading the React app from scratch (loosing the app state then).\r\n\r\nWe were expecting a setState to refresh the App only, not the whole page. Isn't this expected behavior the proper way to react in this scenario?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.",
