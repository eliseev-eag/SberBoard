  "body": "The [GestureEvent API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GestureEvent) is a currently non-standard API to target touch events on **non-touchscreen** computers, e.g. pinch gestures on a laptop trackpad.\r\n\r\nSafari supports this starting from version 9.1 and is currently the sole browser to do so. Apple uses this API for enhancing Apple Maps widgets with \"native gestures\". A live example can be seen on the [WWDC page](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/attending/).\r\n\r\nCurrently, it seems impossible to attach the event handlers for `gesturestart`, `gesturechange` and `gestureend` declaratively via React elements. The only solution is to attach the event handlers manually in `componentWillMount`, `componentDidMount` or as part of ref callbacks. A proper implementation would be highly appreciated!\r\n\r\nNB: Microsoft rolls their own version with `MSGestureEvent`. Its usage seems less straightforward, though.
