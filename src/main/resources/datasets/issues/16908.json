Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nAll versions with hooks\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\n\r\nI originally submitted a feature request for eslint-plugin-react: https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/issues/2417. It was suggested that I make the feature request here instead. I'm not sure which plugin would be the more appropriate place for this.",
