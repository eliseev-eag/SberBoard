Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nHere's a jsfiddle showing that ReactDOMServer.renderToString works correctly, while ReactDOM.server does not.\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/wghk3jnv/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nReactDOM should render the style I specified. :)\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReactDOM 16.6 / Chrome 69 / Mac OS High Sierra / Not sure",
