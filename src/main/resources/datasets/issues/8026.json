You might be adding a ref to a component that was not created inside a component's `render` method, or you have multiple copies of React loaded (details: https://fb.me/react-refs-must-have-owner).\n```\n\non doing `npm ls react` i can see only one version of react installed. I am using gulp and browserify for my build process. Any idea how i can solve this?\n",
