Either wrap the root component in a <Provider>, or explicitly pass \"store\" as a prop to \"Connect(Info)\".\r\n\r\nWarning: Unexpected Fiber popped.\r\n\r\nWarning: Unexpected pop.\r\n\r\nUnexpected context found on stack. This error is likely caused by a bug in React. Please file an issue.\r\n```\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nI can't make a reproduction at the moment, will try to add it as a comment later. I also don't want to forget submitting this, so at least I'm adding it without repro for now.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nWhen entering into a route different than root `React.lazy` should load the correct component.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16.6.0\r\nChrome 70\r\nFirefox 63",
