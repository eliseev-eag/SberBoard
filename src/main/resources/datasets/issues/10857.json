  "body": "Did react used to call .toString() on non string objects it would receive?  A few packages are not working anymore and as far as I can tell this is likely the reason.  Specifically anything using `bem-cn` or similar. \r\n\r\nMight be something to add to docs as a breaking change.\r\n\r\nCan't figure out why else a few components are suddenly throwing errors and dont have any styles on them.
