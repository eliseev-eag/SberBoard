I therefore use this to setup some \"state\", I have some child components which would need access to this \"state\" but can't cause it isn't initialized yet. I'm using \"state\" in quotes since it is not the React component state rather something external (websocket connection).\n\nI could of course use other lifecycle callbacks to trigger the init but that would then execute on the server if I ever choose to use this feature.\n",
