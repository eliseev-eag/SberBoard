When using useEffect to fetch initial data for a page, I see a second page request initiated by react-dom.development.js that instead of going to react app is received by jsonserver which hangs till browser terminate connection. See screenshot below. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40739654/64505468-96012f00-d299-11e9-855c-94405208e198.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nreact: 16.8.6\r\nreact-dom: 16.8.6",
