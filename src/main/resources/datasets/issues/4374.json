  "body": "We're using isomorphic rendering in our app, however we want some items to not be present if Javascript is disabled. In our render method we're doing the following:\n\n``` javascript\nrender: function() {\n  if(typeof window === 'undefined') {\n    return null;\n  }\n  return <span>Hello World</span>;\n}\n```\n\nIt works as expected, however we get the warning:\n\n`Warning: React attempted to reuse markup in a container but the checksum was invalid. This generally means that you are using server rendering and the markup generated on the server was not what the client was expecting. React injected new markup to compensate which works but you have lost many of the benefits of server rendering. Instead, figure out why the markup being generated is different on the client or server:`\n\nThe way to make this go away is to store the check like this:\n\n``` javascript\ncomponentDidMount: function() {\n  this.setState({ isBrowser: typeof window !== 'undefined' });\n},\nrender: function() {\n   if(!this.state.isBrowser) {\n    return null;\n  }\n  return <span>Hello World</span>;\n}\n```\n\nHowever, it doesn't seem like this is the \"right\" place for this to live, maybe I'm wrong. I could also use `this.isMounted()`, however as this is deprecated, it doesn't make much sense to use it.\n\nDoes anyone else have any thoughts on the best way to approach this?\n",
