In development everything is good.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.

Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nreact v16.7.0-alpha.0\r\nreact-dom v16.7.0-alpha.0",
