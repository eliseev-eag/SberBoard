  "body": "There's no shortage of places in React where a dev will write something like\n\n```\nonClick={() => this.setBooksSubjects()}\n```\n\nor alternatively \n\n```\nonClick={this.setBooksSubjects.bind(this)}\n```\n\nIt's not ideal to re-create these functions on each render, so the alternative would be some form of auto-binding in the class's constructor, all of which re-create these functions once per instance, and require boilerplate. \n\nI'd love to see the React team add some way of opting in to having a handler `call`ed with the current component set as this.  By \"current component\" I mean the component whose `render` created the element.  I don't know what it should be called, but, for example, if it were called \"ownClick\" it would look like this\n\n```\n   <button ownClick={this.foo}>Click me</button>\n```\n\nAnd so when that button is clicked, `foo` would be called, with the object that owns the `render` method which rendered the button set as `this`.\n",
