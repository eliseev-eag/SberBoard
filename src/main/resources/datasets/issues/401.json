  "body": "If OSX didn't ship with Ruby 1.8.7, this wouldn't be a big deal, but it does and I would rather not make everybody jump through hoops to be able to contribute to documentation (and see what they're contributing).\n\nRight now, even when using 1.8, sanitize has a nokogiri dependency that requires Ruby 1.9.2. I think there's probably something that could be done in those projects to fix this so feel free to take that path.\n\nThis dependency was introduced with #360.\n",
