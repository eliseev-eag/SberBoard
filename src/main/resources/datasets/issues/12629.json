  "body": "This PR builds on top of the great work of @gaearon in #11894. The main idea is to get rid of all `top*` strings used to identify internal events and replace them with numerical values which the compiler can inline.\r\n\r\nBefore merging this, I have two other questions which I've also asked [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11894#issuecomment-381887113):\r\n\r\n1. Does it really make sense to prefix all event constants with `TOP_`? From the comment in https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-dom/src/events/BrowserEventConstants.js#L10-L16 it's clear that only _some_ of the events are actually listened to at the top level. However the list contains more than that subset (incl. `input`, `invalid`, `reset`, `submit`, and the media events). With that in mind, I think renaming the module to `EventTypes.js` or `InternalEventTypes.js` would be more fitting. What do you think? I know that currently, the `top` prefix is used everywhere - Is there a reason for that? \r\n2. I had to make some worrisome changes to modules that contain `Native` in their name. Specifically when working on the Flow types [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-native-renderer/src/ReactNativeBridgeEventPlugin.js#L32) and [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-native-renderer/src/ReactNativeEventEmitter.js#L91). Would it make sense to type the internal event type as `number | string` so we don't need to touch anything on the react-native side? And what part of the changed modules will also be used on the react-native side? Everything inside `packages/events`?\r\n\r\n## State of this PR\r\n\r\nBesides the open questions, this PR works fine for `react-dom`. The difference in the bundle size is significant (well, at least enough to land #12507 ðŸ™ˆ):\r\n\r\n- `react-dom.production.min.js  (UMD_PROD)` `-1.5%` pre, `-0.9%` post gzip\r\n- `react-dom-test-utils.production.min.js (UMD_PROD)` `-13.2%` pre, `-10.2%` post gzip\r\n- `react-dom-unstable-native-dependencies.production.min.js (UMD_PROD)` `-1.2%` pre, `-0.6%` post gzip\r\n\r\nAll dom related unit tests are green and the fixtures behave as described.\r\n\r\nThere's currently one failing unit test suite (`ReactNativeEvents-test.internal.js`). We'll probably need to clearly look at the react-native boundaries here to see how/if we can keep this change to the DOM side.\r\n\r\nSome libraries that depend on this private API will need adjustment as well (e.g. [this file in `react-native-web`](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/blob/17f8a674b832e25e973962f77205d13bd3f2e878/packages/react-native-web/src/modules/injectResponderEventPlugin/index.js#L10-L18)). Can we do anything to make that easier? We could, for example, create a mapping from the old `top*` strings to the new numbers as an export in `ReactDOMUnstableNativeDependencies`. A similar mapping is already needed for `ReactTestUtils.js`, so we have to maintain it anyhow. ",
