  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*? \r\nBug in npm deployment\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nOur build started failing today, 6/26/2018 since I think react 16.4 starting moving out as npm packages. I think 16.4.0 was maybe fine, but there is something about 16.4.1 that is causing it to not install. These builds have been very stable for months.\r\n \r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. \r\nJust add to your package.json\r\n\"react\": \"^16.3.0\"\r\n\r\n**To reproduce:\r\nI'm using node:boron as my docker container. I can't even get react to install locally on ubuntu 16.10 anymore.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt should intstall on aws codebuild. I've tried forcing a npm cache clean.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nSeems broken in 16.4.1\r\n",
