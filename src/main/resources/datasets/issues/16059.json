  "body": "Currently, the reconciliation process, if finds change in element type, would mark and unmount the element and its sub nodes. And I have a big problem with it, I can't think of any way around but to ask for an improvement in the React core itself.\r\n\r\nFor example, I have Route A and Route B, and in both routes, I have same Layout element, and I can't find a way to change route without un-mounting my Layout component\r\n\r\nIf there could be a way to mark the Route elements, and let it by pass the diffing algorithm, and go on checking the Layout elements like normal, then would be god sent improvement for me\r\n\r\nThanks a lot, and after 15 years of software development, React is the best thing ever for me\r\n\r\nQuan",
