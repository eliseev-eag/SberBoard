  "body": "I'm running into this in an older RN environment. Modern ones look fine (including the today's RN open source). So this is a temporary solution until everything is modern internally.\r\n\r\nWe rely on `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` to avoid holding onto previous versions of any type after a hot reload edit. So this change makes us leak some memory in old environments. I think it's fine because it only affects really old environments (e.g. IE) and the cost is DEV-only (and only comes into play if you actually do a hot reload).\r\n\r\nThe Flow issues are the same we've ran into before. It's a Flow bug but I don't know if it'll get fixed.",
