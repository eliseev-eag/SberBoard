  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhile server rendering React DOM and then hydrating with a different structure, React rightly warns that there are inconsistencies. But when I first saw these warnings I was not sure exactly what was going wrong.\r\n\r\nHere are a few of the warnings I have been receiving:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning: Did not find a matching <button> in <div>.\r\n\r\nWarning: Did not find a matching <img> in <div>.\r\n\r\nWarning: Did not expect server HTML to contain a <div> in <div>.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnly on that last error did I catch on that this was a problem with server-rendering and the inconsistencies between that and my client render (intentional at the moment while testing some things in unpure render functions).\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nBeing more explicit that this was a rendering inconsistency between server and client.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact v16-beta.1",
