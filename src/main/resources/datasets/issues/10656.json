However, it can be seen on a live page https://go2cinema.com\r\n\r\nIt is not clear (without knowing React internals) what uses the `nextEffect`. I have tried using `setState`, etc. Please advise a plausible test case scenario and I will create a test.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nNo error.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n* React ^16.0.0-rc.2.\r\n* Chrome v25\r\n\r\nNote, it is important that Google Chrome v25 works, because otherwise \"Fetch as Google\" does not work either, i.e. pages are not being indexed, e.g. http://imgur.com/a/phmGU.\r\n\r\nSee this discussion https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/6pqrz5/react_16_beta/dkrgvzj/\r\n",
