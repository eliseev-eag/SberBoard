  "body": "You can use [this gist](https://gist.github.com/alexeyraspopov/3c021a41180c176130fb) for reproducing the issue.\n\nFor the 1st test:\n\nI want to make an async request when component is going to be mounted and use the result of a request for updating state. As you will see in test report, it doesn't happen.\n\nFor the 2nd test:\n\nI believe this issue was fixed recently, in 0.14.3. Shallow Render can't recognize sync state updates.\n\nPlease tell me if you see any mistakes in my code, because I was trying to fix these problems in many ways. I hope example code is simple enough.\n",
