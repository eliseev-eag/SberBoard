  "body": "Fixes a bug where deletion effects in the primary tree were dropped before entering the second render pass.\r\n\r\nBecause we no longer reset the effect list after the first render pass, I've also moved the deletion of the fallback children to the complete phase, after the tree successfully renders without suspending.\r\n\r\nWill need to revisit this heuristic when we implement resuming.",
