  "body": "---\n## Note from maintainers:\n\nWe know this is an issue and we know exactly what set of problem can be solved. We want this too but it is a _hard problem_ with our current architecture. Additional comments expressing desire for this feature are not helpful. Feel free to subscribe to the issue (there's button in the right hand column) but do not comment unless you are adding value to the discussion. \"Me too\" and \"+1\" are not valuable, nor are use cases that have already been written in the comments (e.g., we know that you can't put `<tr>` or `<dd>` elements with a `<div>`).\n\n---\n\nConsider the following:\n\n``` js\nvar ManagePost = React.createClass({\n\n  render: function() {\n    var posts = this.props.posts\n\n    var something;\n    var somethingelse;\n\n    var row = posts.map(function(post){\n      return(\n        <div>\n          <div className=\"col-md-8\">\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"cold-md-4\">\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      )\n    });\n\n    return (\n        {row}\n    );\n  }\n\n});\n```\n\nIf you remove the `<div></div>` in the `map`, you get the following error: _Adjacent XJS elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag_\n\nit isn't till I re-add the surrounding, and rather pointless, divs that it compiles with out issue. I am running **0.11.1**\n\nIs this being addressed? It adds extra, and again - IMO - useless and pointless html to the page, that while harming nothing - looks messy and unprofessional. Maybe I am just doing something wrong, please enlighten me if I am.\n",
