  "body": "The deployed (minimal, trimmed down) app is at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.baharev.info/sandbox/eventbug/ \r\n\r\nand the entire source code is at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/baharev/eventbug\r\n\r\nClicking or touching either square should make the clicked / touched square disappear, but only that square. Everything works as intended on my desktop machine both in Chrome and in Firefox. It also shows the correct behavior in Safari on iOS (and I don't care about IE or Edge).\r\n\r\nThe following triggers the bug in Chrome, either on an Android tablet, or on my desktop machine when emulating a hand-held device. Reload the app, and touch or click the top (blue) square: Both squares disappear, and in the console log I see that **the not clicked, and not touched bottom green square received a spurious mousedown event** (which then deleted it).\r\n\r\nThere is `touch-action: none;` in the app.css applied on the squares.  If I didn't use it, I would get the following warning in Chrome when emulating a hand-held device:\r\n\r\n> [Intervention] Unable to preventDefault inside passive event listener due to target being treated as passive. See:  https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5093566007214080\r\n\r\nWith `touch-action: none;` (the way it is in the deployed app), this warning goes away.\r\n\r\n 1. Is the ghost mousedown event due to a bug in my code?\r\n 2. Or is it a bug in React?\r\n 3. Or is it a bug in Chrome? \r\n 4. How can I resolve this issue? (I am looking for a workaround if the bug is not in my code.)\r\n",
