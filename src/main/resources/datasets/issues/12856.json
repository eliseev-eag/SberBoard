  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?** Bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?** \r\nWhen wrapping a with `React.StrictMode`, `setState` is fired twice\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:** \r\n[Here is the jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/446/)\r\nBy clicking on a title and checking the console, you should see that the `setState` is called twice (its callback, however, is called only once). \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nNot sure, it might be related to #12094, then the behaviour might be intended. But when using the previous state to set the new one, then the component breaks if `setState` is fired twice (for instance, toggle components don't work).\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16.3",
