  "body": "So i had a function call to undefined in componentWillReceiveProps:\n\n``` javascript\ncomponentWillReceiveProps: function(nextProps) {\n        var ends = Component.getTimeEnds(nextProps.ends);    // static method\n        var diff = ends.clone().subtract(this.state.ends) // ends.clone is undefined;\n    this.setState({ \n        diff: diff\n    })\n }\n```\n\nwell never mind what it does but since i call undefined it throws, which is caught in ReactMultiChild.updateChildren and not re-thrown for some reason i can't find and can't reproduce in a fiddle.\nAnyways it took me a while to realize it was the culprit, anyone knows why in heaven's name doesn't it throw?\n",
