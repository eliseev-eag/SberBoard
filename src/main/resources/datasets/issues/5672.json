  "body": "It is mentioned in the [react downloads page](http://facebook.github.io/react/downloads.html) that `NODE_ENV` needs to be set to 'production' for development warnings to be disabled. And it suggests using `webpack.DefinePlugin`.\n\n---\n\nAfter searching for quite a bit, I found from @petehunt's [webpack-howto](https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto) project that, I could declare it like this:\n\n```\n// definePlugin takes raw strings and inserts them, so you can put strings of JS if you want.\nvar definePlugin = new webpack.DefinePlugin({\n  __DEV__: JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(process.env.BUILD_DEV || 'true')),\n  __PRERELEASE__: JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(process.env.BUILD_PRERELEASE || 'false'))\n});\n```\n\nI tried setting:\n\n```\n    new webpack.DefinePlugin({\n      NODE_ENV: JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development')\n    }),\n```\n\nbut it didn't work.\n\n---\n\nI had to manually debug why setting NODE_ENV wasn't removing the warning like it said it would.\n\nIt takes around 50s to generate a production build, when I do `webpack -p`. So every small change I make, I need to wait for 50-70s to check the change.\n\n---\n\nFinally I found that react code does this check:\n\n```\nprocess.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'\n```\n\nand in the above setting, NODE_ENV was being passed as a global variable to my code.\n\n```\n    new webpack.DefinePlugin({\n      NODE_ENV: JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development')\n    }),\n```\n\nSince `NODE_ENV` is passed as a global variable to my code, the `process.env.NODE_ENV` that react checks is uninitialised.\n\nSeems like I actually need to set the process variable itself using `DefinePlugin`.\n\n---\n\nWhen I tried:\n\n```\n    process.env.NODE_ENV = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'\n    new webpack.DefinePlugin({\n      process: process,\n    }),\n```\n\nI got some cyclic dependency error.\n\n---\n\nFinally, I did this hack:\n\n```\n    process.env.NODE_ENV = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'\n    new webpack.DefinePlugin({\n      process: JSON.stringify({\n        env: process.env\n      }),\n    }),\n\n```\n\nThis works, and the development warnings have been removed.\n\nBut, as it turns out, it is not quite as small as it should be:\n\n**Without setting NODE_ENV**\n\n```\nTime: 69431ms\n                Asset     Size  Chunks             Chunk Names\n     vendor.bundle.js  1.04 MB       0  [emitted]  vendor\n               app.js   503 kB       1  [emitted]  merchandise_booker\n```\n\n**NODE_ENV=production**\n\n```\nTime: 56195ms\n                Asset     Size  Chunks             Chunk Names\n     vendor.bundle.js  1.09 MB       0  [emitted]  vendor\n               app.js   505 kB       1  [emitted]  merchandise_booker\n```\n\nSetting NODE_ENV=production actually increases the file size.\n",
