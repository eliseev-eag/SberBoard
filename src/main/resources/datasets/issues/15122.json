(I verified sandbox doesn't warn anymore.)\r\n\r\nIf `setState(foo)` caused passive effects to flush, and those in turn caused the component to unmount, there is no way somebody could have foreseen that and guarded `setState` early. Therefore, flushing passive effects temporarily disables the warning until after the next time the work is scheduled.",
