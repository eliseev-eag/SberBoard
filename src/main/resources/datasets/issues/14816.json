  "body": "Fixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14807\r\n\r\n* Adds support for `React.memo` in `React.ShallowRenderer`. Instead of using `element.type` directly it now checks if the element is `REACT_MEMO_TYPE` and uses the nested type if it is.\r\n\r\n* Validates the propTypes for the inner component\r\n\r\n\r\nFor testing I just coped `ReactShallowRenderer-test` and wrapped every component in `React.memo` to validate everything worked. I don't think we should take approach, but it made it easy to find issues ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èmaybe we can have a single set of tests that run with and without memo?\r\n",
