  "body": "**problem:**\r\nThe old \"installation\" page relied on HTML with inline CSS and JS, and the JS doesn't work with our new site infrastructure.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, there were some tabs which switched the content and they are not working in the new docs site.\r\n\r\nWe are trying to make minimal changes to the markdown docs files, because we want to minimize merge conflicts and also not interfere with an ongoing i18n project.\r\n\r\n**solution:**\r\nMade minimal changes to the installation docs file in 'docs';\r\n- removed the non-functional inline JS\r\n- changed a couple of 'h2' to 'h3' (this made the styles look correct)\r\n- changed 'block' tags to 'section' and added wrapper divs (this made it render correctly)\r\n\r\nThen we made a hacky custom component and moved the tab JS there, mostly unchanged.\r\n\r\nIdeally we do a follow-up pass and completely move the styles and JS out of 'docs/docs/installation.md' and clean this up. But for now it's similar to other work-arounds in place for this docs rewrite.",
