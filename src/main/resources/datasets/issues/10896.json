  "body": "Adds a new docs website, built with [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), to replace the old Jekyll site. Source code for the new site lives in `/www` (although markdown and YML data still comes from the legacy `/docs` folder).\r\n\r\nChanges to either markdown or website source code can be previewed on Netlify. The react-js bot should automatically add comments to each PR with preview links. (This preview is generated by running the newly-added `yarn build:docs` command in the root `package.json`.)\r\n \r\nThe majority of the changes in this PR are contained within the new `/www` directory. However some minor modifications have been made to existing content in the `/docs` directory:\r\n* Modified frontmatter `author` block to always be an array\r\n* Small markdown formatting tweaks\r\n\r\n**I do have one open question about this PR though.** In order to simplify the build script, I added a `.nvmrc` file to require Node v8.4.0. Is this acceptable? If it is frowned on for any reason, I can update the build script to remove the newer async/await syntax.\r\n\r\nOnce this PR has been merged, I'll update Netlify and set `master` as the main branch for the website. Then to make it live (more live) we can merge something like #10856 and push out one final update to `gh-pages`.",
