Read how to correctly configure React for production: https://fb.me/react-perf-use-the-production-build\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nIt's related to compiling/bundling, so there would be a substantial number of dependencies other than React.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nDon't throw the error when compiling with WebPack and following the guide at the given link (https://fb.me/react-perf-use-the-production-build).\r\nDevelopment code should not be included when `WebPack.DefinePlugin` is used to set `process.env.NODE_ENV` to `\"production\"` and `WebPack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin` is configured to run on all `.js` files with `test: /\\.(js|jsx)$/`, `compress: { warnings: false }` and `sourceMap: false`.\r\n\r\nNOTE: License comments in the bundle suggest that `react-dom.production.min.js` as well as `react-dom.development.js` are both included along with `react.production.min.js` and `react.development.js`.\r\n\r\nThis could be a WebPack configuration issue, however the entire bundle \"seems\" to be \"uglified\" and no other packages seem to exhibit anything other than production behavior.\r\n\r\nIf you want to peck around in the bundle, please enjoy :) http://booklets.resist.design/index-entry.js?a441990c7d318c1cf5fc\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.4.0\r\n\r\n15.x.x didn't have this issue with the same WebPack configuration.\r\n",
