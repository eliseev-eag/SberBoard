  "body": "Basically I'm working on the top level nodes. I use a fiber for that. That's nice because it allow us to nest them inside the tree for things like portals. It also allows me to reuse the child reconciliation for the top level.\n\nThe current thing won't quite work because there needs to be two fibers even at the top level. Work in progress. I might just to another mutable top level node that's not a fiber.\n\nIt also has a priority feature which searches the **current** tree (not the work in progress since that no long exists after a flush) for the highest priority work to do next. This is a key component of this architecture. The priority flag represents the highest priority in the subtree.\n\nPending state updates will have priority associated with themselves on the fiber itself.\n\nThere is currently no priority associated with the pending props themselves which means that they get the same priority as anything deep in the tree. Pending props is kind of an edge case. I think that the only time that happens is if you have a high priority update which leads to update a lower priority tree so that the update in that tree gets deprioritized. But I'm not completely sure how this will work yet. Maybe they should only ever exists on the \"work in progress\" nodes.\n\nWhen a new change comes in we reset and rescan the tree. That change could've been a higher priority or higher/earlier in the tree than what we're currently working on. We can probably avoid this reset+rescan for new changes which has lower priority.\n\nCurrently this reset throws out the work already done to the tree, so we'll need to start look at the \"alternate\" tree to see if there was already any work done there that we can reuse. We can use pending props for that.\n",
