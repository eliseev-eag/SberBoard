  "body": "I would like to create a renderer that extends react-dom, that is overrides some parts of it.\n\nThe goal is to be able to keep react-dom but swap out some parts of it, ultimately `ReactCompositeComponent` and `ReactDOMComponent`.\n\nSince in 0.14 react-dom is buried inside react itself, I created a script that downloads some react-dom files, and created a jscodeshift transform that rewrites imports from `var ReactCurrentOwner = require(ReactCurrentOwner');`to `var ReactCurrentOwner = require('react/lib/ReactCurrentOwner');`, and to files i'd like to customize `var ReactMount = require('./ReactMount');` (how fun is that ? :) ).\n\nIt seems react 0.15 will bring significant changes regarding react-dom and react separation, but for now we have to work around this.\n\nSo I end up with custom `ReactDOM`, `ReactMount`, `ReactDefaultInjection`, `instantiateReactComponent`, `ReactChildReconciler` and `ReactMultiChild`.\n\nBut when i try to render something with my custom `ReactDOM.render`, I get this error : \n\n```\nUncaught Invariant Violation: EventPluginRegistry: Cannot inject event plugin ordering more than once. You are likely trying to load more than one copy of React.\n```\n\nSince the injection is called once with my custom injection, how is that possible ? Am I missing something here ? I suspect some global tying things somehow but can't figure it.\n\nI created a repo with this little experiment here : https://github.com/jide/react-dom-custom\n",
