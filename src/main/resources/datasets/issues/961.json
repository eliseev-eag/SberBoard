  "body": "This is how I've been conditionally putting the `disabled` attribute on elements, with a boolean variable:\n\n``` jsx\n<input disabled={isDisabled} type=... />\n```\n\nWhen `isDisabled` is falsey, the attribute won't be output. When true, it will output the following, which works in browsers but is against the [HTML5 spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#boolean-attributes):\n\n``` html\n<input disabled=\"true\" type=... />\n```\n\nI could get in line with the spec by setting `disabled=\"disabled\"` on the element, but that requires a ternary operation instead of a simple boolean:\n\n``` jsx\n<input disabled={isDisabled ? \"disabled\" : false} ... />\n```\n\nIdeally, my current bit of JSX (at the top of this issue) would output this HTML, assuming `disabled` is set to true:\n\n``` html\n<input disabled type=... />\n```\n\nMore generally, if a known boolean attribute gets assigned a variable set to `true` as in my example, JSX should output just the attribute as per the HTML5 spec.\n",
