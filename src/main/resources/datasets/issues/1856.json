  "body": "Hello, I like Idea of immutability helpers in react, but I find them incomplete. I still from time to time switch to Underscore for complex operations on data. Does it make sense to add more helpers like:\n- $map\n- $filter\n- $fold\n- set like operations (union/difference/intersection), of course they can be implemented in terms of fold.\n\nWhat do you think guys? Thanks.\n",
