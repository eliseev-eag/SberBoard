  "body": "**This PR addresses issue #11805**\r\n\r\nMajor changes:\r\n- The control flow is noticeably changed. Individual becnhmarks can't be prepared/run one by one, so the process now consists of the following steps:\r\n   - build React bundles for local and remote repos;\r\n   - define the list of benchmarks to be run (for local and remote);\r\n   - build all benchmarks, copy them to the server root folder;\r\n   - prepare the runner queue (interleaved or random);\r\n   - start HTTP server and run individual benchmarks according to the queue;\r\n   - gather stats, calculate averages;\r\n   - print results;\r\n- Both local and remote benchmarks now served with the same server instance simultaneously. It allows running benchmarks in any order;\r\n- All benchmarks are served from the `/scripts/bench/public` folder, where they are copied on the preparation step;\r\n- Support for mismatching list of becnhmarks on local and remote branch (i.e. a new benchmark is created locally and not exists on the remote master);\r\n- Support for running benchmarks in the interleaved (default) or random (pass `--order=random`) order;\r\n- **Fix:** the original script seems to be serving only from the local branch becnhmark folder, regardless whether it's local or remote becnhmark run;\r\n",
