  "body": "Bug in documentation\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nReact's spread operator was removed in React 16, but it is still in the documentation https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#spread-attributes\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nA word of caution should be included that this does not include React 16+. Maybe also add other ways of spreading props.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16+. It worked in previous releases.",
