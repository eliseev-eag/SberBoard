  "body": "In [extjs-reactor](extjs-reactor) we use some react internal methods like mountComponent, unmountComponent, and receiveComponent, as well as the ReactMultiChild mixin to defer rendering to Ext JS.  This interface was very helpful for anyone looking to make generic JS component libraries work in React (as opposed to those built specifically for React).\r\n\r\nIs there an equivalent/alternative way to control the mounting of a component in the new Fiber architecture?\r\n\r\nIf it helps, here is the code that references the React internal methods:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sencha/extjs-reactor/blob/master/packages/reactor/src/ExtJSComponent.js",
