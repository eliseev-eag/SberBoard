  "body": "Our client uses Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to automate interaction with React web app that we provide. The App itself works great but when you run it in the RPA platform, it does not render my main **\\<App/>** component into the **\\<div id=\"root\">\\</div>** tag of the **index.html** page. I tried to use different browser's engines in the RPA platform with no success.\r\nWhat I found is that the problem is only with React 16 version, but the 15 version works as expected.\r\nPlease help me understand what changes in version 16 may be responsible for this behavior.",
