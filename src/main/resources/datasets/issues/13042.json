  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nWhile i'm inclined to believe it is a bug, there may be rationale behind it being expected behaviour.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen there is a component that sets a value on its' underlying element via the ref, and this component is a child of another component and given a stable key, this value is reset when it is reconciled.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nWe have a table with horizontally scrollable rows and some custom scrollbars.\r\nAs such, the scroll offset is maintained via the ref using the scrollLeft property.\r\nThis table is also sortable.\r\nWhen you sort the table, the rows are properly reconciled (no render methods are called on a row), yet the scrollLeft value is reset to 0 for the row.\r\n_If you remove the key from the row, it works as expected._\r\n\r\nHere is a simple case reproducing this behaviour.\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/q9pq7q10nw\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI would have expected that the properties set on the ref would be maintained in the reconciliation process.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nVersion of React: 16.4 (was also the behaviour in 16.3)",
