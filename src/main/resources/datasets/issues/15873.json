If someone wants something to fire at initial render, they can use with second parameter equal to [].\r\n\r\nFor the following case:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuseEffect(\r\n  () => {\r\n   //\r\n  },\r\n  [someParam]\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don t expect it to run for the initial render. \r\n\r\nCan React provide any solution to this problem?
