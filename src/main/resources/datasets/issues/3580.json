  "body": "This causes a variety of hard-to-debug issues. This implements the proposed warning from the comments in #2402.\n\nThere are already a number of specific places in the code which warn about using multiple copies of React but those don't always get triggered. This adds a check at the top of the main module which spits out a warning before any of the initialization runs.\n\nFixes #2402\n\n(Apologies, I closed the previous PR due to a force push in my branch)\n",
