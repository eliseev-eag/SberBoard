  "body": "Initially I tried updating the version of React but this caused Node to resolve it to the parent directory, and Babel started failing because it didn’t recognize the `presets` option. To fix this, I updated Babel as well. I had to add the presets explicitly since Babel 6 requires that. While we don’t explicitly use ES6 in the example I figured that adding a preset to it would cause less confusion than omitting it.\n\nBoth `npm start` and `npm run build` work correctly in my testing.\n\nReviewers: @zpao \n",
