This usually means that you're trying to add a ref to a component that doesn't have an owner (that is, was not created inside of another component's `render` method). Try rendering this component inside of a new top-level component which will hold the ref.invariant @ react-famous.js:14029ReactOwner.addComponentAsRefTo @ react-famous.js:17122attachRef @ react-famous.js:17000ReactRef.attachRefs @ react-famous.js:17016attachRefs @ react-famous.js:16872assign.notifyAll @ react-famous.js:16708ON_DOM_READY_QUEUEING.close @ react-famous.js:30946Mixin.closeAll @ react-famous.js:18011Mixin.perform @ react-famous.js:17952batchedMountComponentIntoNode @ react-famous.js:22009Mixin.perform @ react-famous.js:17938ReactDefaultBatchingStrategy.batchedUpdates @ react-famous.js:29068batchedUpdates @ react-famous.js:16465ReactMount._renderNewRootComponent @ react-famous.js:22144ReactPerf.measure.wrapper @ react-famous.js:16813ReactMount.render @ react-famous.js:22233ReactPerf.measure.wrapper @ react-famous.js:16813(anonymous function) @ main.jsx:114runStartupCallbacks @ startup_client.js:30ready @ startup_client.js:32\n```\n\nAt the bottom, I see my file, `main.jsx`.
