Use a static property named `defaultProps` instead.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template for React 16: https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/, template for React 15: https://jsfiddle.net/hmbg7e9w/).**\r\n- create a new project `Project A` that uses `create-react-class` to create a Component `ComponentX`\r\n- build the project into a library (minify all js assets)\r\n- create another project `Project B` and include `Project A` as a dependency\r\n- Create another React Component `const ComponentY extends React.Component`, and use `ComponentX` from `Project A`\r\n- bundle `Project B` with production build\r\n- create a third project `Project C`, and include `Project B` as a dependency\r\n- build a react app that uses `ComponentY` from `Project B`\r\n- warnings!!!!\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nthere should not have any warnings regarding `create-react-class` from a third party dependency\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact version 15.6.2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne quick example is installing `adslot-ui` as a dependency (https://www.npmjs.com/package/adslot-ui/tutorial), then create a react app that uses `Carousel` component (this component implements `nuka-carousel`, which uses `create-react-class`)",
