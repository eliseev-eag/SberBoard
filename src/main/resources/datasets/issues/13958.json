  "body": "It seems like react-is v16.6 no longer is compatible with React v16.3 - v16.5, in that React v16.3 - v16.5 will use `Symbol(react.async_mode)`, but `react-is`'s `AsyncMode` export will instead be `Symbol(react.concurrent_mode)`.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the async mode symbol needs to remain the same in react-is 16.6+, and the `isAsyncMode` function would need to check *both* the AsyncMode and ConcurrentMode symbols.",
