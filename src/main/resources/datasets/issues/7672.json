  "body": "In order to properly type an `Operation`, we need to change the call site from having two arguments: one for `type` and one for `payload` into an object that contains both. This isn't a perf regression because we were already constructing this object in the first place and doesn't change the emitted event so shouldn't affect the dev tools.\n\nNone of the call sites are actually flow-ified so it isn't technically used but once we will, it'll make sure that we don't send random strings and payload through those very generic methods.\n",
