  "body": "Extracted from https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12643.\r\n\r\nWe're currently diff a host node in the complete phase even if it has bailed out in the begin phase. By itself, this just means we're doing a little bit more work than necessary. But it also has some observable effects. In particular, https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13424 (which by itself would be very rare and probably not worth fixing) is made worse because we end up committing update to inputs from another component.\r\n\r\nI have a fix for this in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13423. Filing this for posterity.",
