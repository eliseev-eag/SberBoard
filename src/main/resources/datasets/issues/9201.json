  "body": "Changes dev mode version of `invokeGuardedCallback` to use a higher-order function instead of a global event listener. More straightforward and avoids cross-browser weirdness. ~~(I'm almost a bit worried that I'm forgetting some caveat, given that I didn't implement it this way originally, and instead opted for a more complicated solution. Most likely I just wasn't thinking clearly.)~~ Yup, forgot something obvious.\r\n\r\n### Test plan\r\n \r\n- [ ] Confirm that it fixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9092\r\n- [ ] Confirm that browser devtools still break on exception",
