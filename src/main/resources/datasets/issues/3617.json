  "body": "Firstly, I sincerely apologise if this is the wrong place to be asking this question, but I haven't seen this answered in other places and think it definitely relates to usage of React.js.\n\nThere has been some consternation and confusion about Facebook's [patent grant](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/PATENTS) declared in their project (including this one).\n- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9271331\n- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9111849\n- http://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/318rar/patents_file_and_its_implications/\n\nSpecifically:\n\n> The license granted hereunder will terminate, automatically and without notice,\n> for anyone that makes any claim (including by filing any lawsuit, assertion or\n> other action) alleging ... (b) that any right in any patent claim of Facebook is invalid or\n> unenforceable.\n\nI'm not a lawyer, but I interpret this to mean that if I use React and publicly voice concern about the quality or validity of any patent owned by Facebook, that the access to React-related patents is terminated automatically and I am now open to being sued for patent infringement. I may be a little paranoid, but I also wonder if simply discussing this issue is grounds for patent grant termination.\n\nThe (a) clause makes perfect sense, in terms of protecting Facebook from unnecessary patent litigation. The desired purpose (spirit) and actual purpose (letter) of the (b) clause are just confusing and concerning.\n\nIf you can please point me to where this discussion / answer has already taken place, that would be terrific.\n\nIf there is not yet official word from Facebook on this issue, then please point me to the arena in which is this going to take place (or is more likely / appropriate).\n",
