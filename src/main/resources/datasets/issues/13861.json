For example classes are supposed to use `contextType` (https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/pull/1265) instead.\r\n\r\nSo we want to hide it a bit deeper. This makes it only available via direct dispatcher read. Also removes an extra runtime check.\r\n\r\n**Libraries can still use it by calling the dispatcher directly.**",
