  "body": "_(x-post from the [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/reactjs/qaG_qRMo29o))_\n\nHi,\n\nI'm working on a project that uses [Foundation's modal system](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/reveal.html), but I've run into a bit of a pain-point.\n\nIt seems that whenever a modal launches/closes, Foundation manipulates the DOM in it's own special way, and as a result React's Virtual DOM loses track of what's going on. After this all of React's event handlers break, since the DOM has changed.\n\nI've created a plunk to illustrate this. I basically want the button within the modal to utilise React's _onClick_ event handler and call the _clickButton()_ function, but no dice:\nSee http://plnkr.co/edit/Z6y5dI?p=preview\n\nUpon clicking the button, I get the following error in the console:\n\n``` javascript\nError: Invariant Violation: findComponentRoot(..., .0.1.3): Unable to find element. This probably means the DOM was unexpectedly mutated (e.g., by the browser), usually due to forgetting a <tbody> when using tables or nesting <p> or <a> tags. Try inspecting the child nodes of the element with React ID ``.\n```\n\nI've tried a combination of things including using _forceUpdate()_ in conjunction with Foundation's own modal event system, but I just can't get things to work. This [SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24239157/how-to-make-react-js-play-nice-together-with-zurb-reveal-modal-form) is related.\n\nAssistance appreciated!\n\nCheers,\n\nDhruv Bhatia\n",
