It cannot works like Class Componet's 'setState'  method, which receives a callback param, and can perform the callback after this setState action updates;\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/93mkr1ywpr\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nHopes the SetStateAction function can receive a second callback argument, and can used like 'setState' method callback. \r\n\r\nI have read the official note: \r\n\r\n>     // this technically does accept a second argument, but it's already under a deprecation warning\r\n>     // and it's not even released so probably better to not define it.\r\n\r\nIf instead it's working as intended, how can I perform special action after this SetStateAction called ? \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16.7.0-alpha.0\r\n\r\n",
