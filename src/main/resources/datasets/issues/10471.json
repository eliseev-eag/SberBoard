  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug (I think)\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIf you have two elements next two each other and the mouse moves from element 1 to element 2 then if I have registered an event listeners as below\r\n```\r\nelement1.addEventListener('mouseenter', () => ...)\r\nelement2.addEventListener('mouseleave', () => ...)\r\n\r\nelement2.addEventListener('mouseenter', () => ...)\r\nelement2.addEventListener('mouseleave', () => ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe see that the mouseleave event is *always* fired before the mouse enter event.\r\n\r\nThe same is true if I have a react component as follows\r\n```\r\nconst MyComponent = () => (\r\n    <div>\r\n        <div\r\n            id=\"div1\"\r\n            onMouseEnter={() => ...}\r\n            onMouseLeave={() => ...}\r\n        >\r\n            Div 1\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div\r\n            id=\"div2\"\r\n            onMouseEnter={() => ...}\r\n            onMouseLeave={() => ...}\r\n        >\r\n            Div 2\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n);\r\n```\r\nagain the mouse enter events fire after the mouse leave events, for elements sharing the boundary.\r\n\r\n*However*\r\n\r\nIf I mix events, and use synthetic react events for mouse enter and dom events for mouse leave I find that the mouse enter event handler is triggered before the mouse leave event handler for elements sharing the same boundary\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\nCodePen: https://codepen.io/johnjwood/pen/QMOeEP?editors=0111\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nMouse enter should always fire after mouse leave even when we are using a mixture of synthetic and dom events\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 15.6.1,\r\nOS: windows 7;\r\n\r\nBroken in both:\r\nChrome: 60.0.3112.90\r\nIE: 11.09600.18738CO\r\n\r\n",
