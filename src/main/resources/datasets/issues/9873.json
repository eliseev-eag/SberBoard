  "body": "This removes the flag that used to force Stack into HTML generation mode even for client side.\r\nIt should make our CI runs a bit faster.\r\n\r\nNote that we didnâ€™t rely on this in the bundles for a long time.\r\nThe only real use of this flag was the HTML generation test that we run on CI.\r\n\r\nHowever it no longer represents the way forward (server renderer was separated from Stack), and we have a new suite that covers HTML generation specifically that's independent of this flag.\r\n\r\nI still keep the actual HTML generation codepath in the DOMStack, so that we can keep using the Stack bundle. It's just not covered by the normal Stack tests anymore (but it's still covered by new integration tests).",
