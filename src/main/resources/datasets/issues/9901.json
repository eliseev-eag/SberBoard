  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen mousing into a descendant DOM node that has a different React root, the mouseLeave event on the parent React DOM component is fired unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\n\r\nDemo: https://codesandbox.io/s/lqm3M147\r\n\r\n1. Open the console to see the logs printed.\r\n2. Mouse from the \"Parent\" into the \"Normal Child\", and then back out, and note that `mouseLeave` __does not__ fire\r\n2. Mouse from the \"Parent\" into the \"Portal Child\", rendered by embedding a new React root, and note that `mouseLeave` __does__ fire. Mouse back out, and note that it fires again. Sometimes, it fires multiple times for the enter/exit step.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n`mouseLeave` should not fire when entering/exiting the \"Portal Child\", since it is a descendant node of \"Parent\".\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nTested with the following, and the issue is reproducible in all cases\r\n* React 15.4.1 and 15.5.3\r\n* Latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari",
