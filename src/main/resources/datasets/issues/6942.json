  "body": "The old `cloneWithProps` has a nice example, but mentions that it's deprecated in favour of `React.cloneElement` - https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/clone-with-props.html\n\nMeanwhile https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#react.cloneelement is pretty terse, and links to a blog post from 0.13rc2 which has a decent example.\n\nI'm proposing adding a guide page about \"modifying\" child properties which has a very similar example to the old `cloneWithProps` page, and then linking to it from there and the cloneElement API docs.\n\nSeem reasonable? I can put together a PR if so.\n",
