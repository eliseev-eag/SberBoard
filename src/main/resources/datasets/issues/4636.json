  "body": "TransitionGroup will clone its children and change their refs. Therefore there doesn't seem to exist any easy hack to directly access their instance or call methods. Especially, this makes filtering, intercepting and dispatching events almost impossible. \n\nIt will be great if we could make a way to fix this, I figured out it is hard to use refs because of children are cloned, but implementing a method could be an easy way around:\n\nTransitionGroup.getChildWithRef('child ref') => return child with that ref\n",
