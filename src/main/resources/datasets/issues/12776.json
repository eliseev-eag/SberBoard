  "body": "(Apologies if this has been discussed before, I searched and didn't find anything.)\r\n\r\nCurrently if you create an array of elements without keys you get a key warning message, and if you create a fragment of elements without keys you do not. Until today I assumed that meant \"ah, React 16.2 introduced some clever new tech that obviated the need for keys\". But I learned today that that is not the case. Right now, I believe you can make a dynamic list of elements, throw it in a fragment, and get no key warning message â€“ but have bad performance and non-stable updates.\r\n\r\nAs best as I can tell, the reason for the difference in behavior is that fragments are _expected_ to be understood as having a different semantic meaning than arrays,Â to be used for static content only. But if we're relying on that expectation to avoid a major gotcha, I would assume it would be explicitly mentioned in the docs for fragments, and prominently featured in a warning-style yellow box. Instead, I don't believe it's mentioned at all.\r\n\r\nThe dual behaviors make a lot of sense to me (if React can't figure out on its own whether siblings need keys, it's great for us to have a way to explicitly tell it when they do or don't) but it seems to me that such an important and subtle nuance would call for a lot of documentation and instead has none that I can find.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I've misunderstood any of this â€“Â I figure that's more likely than not ðŸ˜… ",
