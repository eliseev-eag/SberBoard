Every `750ms` we update the (`top`, `left`) values for all the elements inside `boxes` array. \r\n\r\nWhile updating if the order of elements doesn't change then every box animates to it's new position. However if we **uncomment line 31** which shuffles the boxes, then only elements which retain their position from previous render animate to new positions. \r\n\r\nYou can observe this behaviour in the sandbox. With `_shuffle` on sometimes boxes jump to their new positions while with `_shuffle` off they always animate. \r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/r5p48kzop\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nRegardless of the order of `boxes` all the box elements should animate to their new positions since they have unique `key` property set on them. \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact `16.3.2` & `16.4.1`, Chrome, MacOS. \r\n",
