Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.

Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nLatest version.\r\n\r\n(This is basically just #14216, but that was closed because HTML attribute name is case-insensitive. However, this is still a problem for SVG, since SVG attribute name is case-sensitive, and thus `crossOrigin` doesn't work.)",
