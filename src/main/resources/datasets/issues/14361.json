  "body": "How do I build react with source maps?\r\n\r\nI am in `master` branch with the latest code. I tried setting rollup config to `sourcemap: true` and setting `\"sourceMaps\": true` in .babalrc. I am getting the following error.\r\n\r\n`Sourcemap is likely to be incorrect: a plugin was used to transform files, but didn't generate a sourcemap for the transformation. Consult the plugin documentation for help`\r\n\r\nI want to generate source maps so that I can set breakpoints in the actual es6 package code and step through it.\r\n",
