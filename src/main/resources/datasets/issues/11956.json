  "body": "jsdom update made this one challenging.\r\n\r\n<s>It uncovered some issues in tests, but I believe some of the remaining 9 tests I haven't fixed yet actually point out legit problems (where we emit a different number of warnings on the server and on the client).</s>\r\n\r\nI made one change to the behavior. Previously we were emitting two different warnings (about bad prop casing and about client/server mismatch) when hydrating a badly cased SVG attribute like `<text textlength=\"10\" />`. In https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11956/commits/ed93325e007f76cbeefd11f5cf9c4c2b97bbd969, I changed it to only emit one warning (about the prop casing) since that's the actionable one. This fixed the tests (which assume the number of warnings is consistent between server and client).\r\n  ",
