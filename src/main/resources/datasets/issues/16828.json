  "body": "<!--\r\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\r\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nClarification on how hooks behave inside event handlers\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI'm looking to get image heights before I render them, and it seems like the behavior of the hooks change when used in Event Handlers (or other asynchronous functions).\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { data, loading, error } = useQuery(GET_ARTICLES)\r\n\r\nconst [preloadedImageHeights, setPreloadedImageHeights]: any = useState([])\r\n\r\n    useEffect(() => {\r\n        data &&\r\n            data.message.map((message: Message) => {\r\n                if (message.image != undefined) {\r\n                    let image = new Image()\r\n                    image.src = message.image\r\n                    image.onload = () => checkOnload(message.image!)\r\n                }\r\n            })\r\n    }, [data])\r\n\r\n    const checkOnload = (url: string) => {\r\n        console.log(\"I just loaded!\", url)\r\n        setPreloadedImageHeights([...preloadedImageHeights, url])\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    useEffect(() => {\r\n        console.log(\"preloadedImageHeights\", preloadedImageHeights)\r\n    }, [preloadedImageHeights])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe hooks override the previous data, despite using the correct `[...item, newItem]` syntax - meaning there's definitely something wrong with my understanding of how they work.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would expect this to return something that looks like this;\r\n\r\n```js\r\npreloadedImageHeights [\"url1\", \"url2\", \"url3\" /* and so on */]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut instead, I see that it's overridden each time.\r\n\r\n```js\r\npreloadedImageHeights [\"url1\"]\r\npreloadedImageHeights [\"url2\"]\r\npreloadedImageHeights [\"url3\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy thinking is that I'm messing up the hooks by putting them in that loop - but it's not clear to me how this can be done with hooks.\r\n\r\nBut, what confuses me is that if I add the following button, and click it, it behaves normally.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<button onClick={() => checkOnload(\"potato\")}>Potato</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.9",
