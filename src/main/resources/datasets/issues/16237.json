  "body": "**This is a feature request with somewhat bc breaking behaviour**\r\n\r\nCurrently, useCallback and useMemo behave like useEffect, if a single argument is given. This means, they reevaluate on every render. While this makes a lot of sense for useEffect, i can't see use cases, where someone would want that with useCallback or useMemo, given that it's intended use case is to reduce the amount of times the given function is called or result is recreated.\r\n\r\nWhile the 4 digits of unnecssary code are not that much - still unnecessary though -, i'm guessing i'm not the only one who would assume such a standard behaviour just to find out, it's not working.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n",
