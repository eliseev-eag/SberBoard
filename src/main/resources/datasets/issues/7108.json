  "body": "In the documentation for the [component API](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-api.html) , it says:\n\n`NEVER mutate this.state directly, as calling setState() afterwards may replace the mutation you made. Treat this.state as if it were immutable.`\n\nHowever, the documentation for [ES6 Classes](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#es6-classes) says:\n\n`The API is similar to React.createClass with the exception of getInitialState. Instead of providing a separate getInitialState method, you [can mutate] this.state in the constructor.`\n\nPerhaps it would be possible to make this exception to `this.state` mutation more clear?\n",
