  "body": "`ReactComponentTreeHook` was originally intended to be a DEV module but has since had production usage with Fiber. This PR aims on splitting the methods out so that we don't ship extra code in production. Flow annotations were added to places that confused Flow into believing methods were missing on `ReactComponentTreeHook`. \r\n\r\nNote: I'm a bit unsure about the require path remaining as `react/lib/ReactComponentTreeHook` though @sebmarkbage, do we still need to keep it this way?",
