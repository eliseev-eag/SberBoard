  "body": "I'm filing this issue because we are seriously looking at using React in Firefox devtools, and I'm starting to work on migrating a few of our components. XUL has weird constraints on the format of the DOM in edge cases, and I hope that somehow we can make it work. Long-term we want to migrate away from XUL but that's not an option for a while.\n\n`React.createElement` works very nicely to create all the custom XUL elements. \n\nThe first thing I ran into is boolean attributes. In XUL, you always have to specify a property value, so `<foo hidden>` is invalid, it must be `<foo hidden=\"true\">`. I fixed it for the hidden attribute by changing\n\n`hidden: MUST_USE_ATTRIBUTE | HAS_BOOLEAN_VALUE,`\n\nto just\n\n`hidden: MUST_USE_ATTRIBUTE,`\n\nin the `HTMLDOMPropertyConfig` option. I foresee having to customize this object more. An interesting solution would be a private API to override this config somehow. I'm not well along enough yet to suggest a real solution, but I want to document things as I hit them.\n",
