  "body": "The priority of passive effects is supposed to be the same as the priority of the render. (That was the original intended behavior, at least.) The first commit fixes a bug where the priority is sometimes wrong if the effects are flushed early.\r\n\r\nHowever, the priority should really never be higher than Normal Priority.\r\n\r\nThe second commit changes the behavior so that effects always have normal priority, or lower if the render priority is lower (e.g. offscreen prerendering).\r\n\r\nThe implementation is a bit awkward because of the way `renderRoot`, `commitRoot`, and `flushPassiveEffects` are split. This is a known factoring problem that I'm planning to address once 16.9 is released.",
