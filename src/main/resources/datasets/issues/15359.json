  "body": "some background:\r\n\r\nwhen dealing with inline styles (e.g. radium), SSR and caching of SSR results, you might run into problems because of differences in vendor prefixes. Best tradeof is to render always with all vendor prefixes on the server. But this will lead to style missmatches on hydration. You can use `suppressHydrationWarning`, but then you have to add this property to every element that receives these styles, which is not practical.\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nfeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nstyle missmatch causes a warning on development. \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nyou can set a global flag to supress style missmatch warnings\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
