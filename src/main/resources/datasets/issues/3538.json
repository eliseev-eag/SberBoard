  "body": "I expected there to be an issue for this already, but couldn't find it. Apologies if this a dupe.\n\nOccasionally it is useful to put a few elements in an array within render, when conditionally building different bits of the view.\nReact will issue a warning whenever an array is used that doesn't have keys - even if the author knows that this array is literal, and therefore doesn't require keys.\n\n``` js\nvar label = \"Label\";\nif (this.props.important) {\n  label = [\"Label\", <Tag text=\"important\" />];\n}\nreturn <div>\n  <h3>{label}</h3>\n  <p>{this.props.body}</p>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn this example, React will warn about lack of keys, even though they're not needed.\n\nOne option would be to extend `React.addons.createFragment` to accept an array, and use the indexes as keys.\n\n``` jsx\nlabel = React.addons.createFragment([\"Label\", <Tag text=\"important\" />]);\n```\n",
