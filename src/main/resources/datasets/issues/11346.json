  "body": "Adds the ability to start rendering work without flushing the changes\r\nto the screen, by blocking the commit phase. This can be used to\r\ncoordinate React's commit phase with other async work.\r\n\r\n- `root.prerender` schedules an update and returns a work object.\r\n- `work.then` schedules a completion callback that fires once the work completes.\r\n- `work.commit` unblocks the commit phase and flushes the remaining\r\n  work synchronously.\r\n\r\n(Lazy roots that start rendering before the DOM container is available are not yet implemented; I'll do that in a subsequent PR.)\r\n\r\n`root.render` and `root.unmount` were updated to also return work objects. In those cases, since the commit phase is not deferred, by the time the `then` callback is fired, the work has already committed.",
