  "body": "Reading them from `UIManager` during registration forces a Prepack deopt.\r\n\r\nAlthough a handful of React Native views define their configs in JavaScript (eg `RCTText`, `ReactNativeART`) the majority require them to be loaded from `UIManager` (eg `RCTView`). For consistency/simplicity, all view registrations have been updated to use this new lazy-config approach.\r\n\r\nDownstream I have also updated `requireNativeComponent`. While testing, I noticed that this method fell back to returning an `UnimplementedView` component if a view config could not be found in `UIManager`. Apparently this was a short-term solution in place for Ads Manager at a time when Android didn't support many of the RN view types. After discussion with the React Native team, I've added an invariant here instead. This simplifies our Flow typing and avoids unnecessary runtime checks.",
