  "body": "So I've been struggling trying to figure this out and nothing I can find helps. I've got a function that renders a component for every item in an array pretty much. It works perfectly fine except for the fact that it gives me a bunch of warnings all saying the same.\n![screenshot from 2016-03-31 14-25-12](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11371200/14189850/c53bb398-f74c-11e5-90cd-8e04bb8b786c.png)\nThese keys never change no matter what I try and set it to. Here is my code below: \n\n```\nfunction renderTimes(groupedRaces) {\n  return Object.keys(groupedRaces).map((date) => {\n    return (\n      <div key={date}>\n        <div style={styles.date}>{date}</div>\n        {\n          groupedRaces[date].map((race) => {\n            return ( <TimeSlot key={race.id} race={race}/> );\n          })\n        }\n      </div>\n    );\n  })\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, I set the key for each component but it doesn't even use it. I know for a fact that {race.id} is unique too. I've tried adding and removing the keys from all the elements in my code as well as setting them to different values but it still always prints out 4 warnings with these as the keys:\n`\n.0:$84414\n.0:$84415\n.0:$84416\n.0:$84417\n`\nAlso using React 0.14.6 if that could make a difference\n",
