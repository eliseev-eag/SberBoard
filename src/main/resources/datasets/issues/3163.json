  "body": "As `PropTypes` is about the 'type' of prop, `null` is an empty object, but still a type of object, practically.\n\nBut still it warns: \n\n```\n Warning: Required prop `profile` was not specified in `Element`. Check the render method of `OtherElement`.\n```\n\nI don't think this is supposed to happen.\n\nIt stops warning after it is not `null` anymore. I'm pretty sure it should only warn when it is `undefined` ?\n",
