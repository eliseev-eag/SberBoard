  "body": "We used to require setting it to `'test'` because `rewrite-modules` step [treated it specially](https://github.com/facebook/fbjs/blob/c69904a511b900266935168223063dd8772dfc40/packages/babel-preset-fbjs/plugins/rewrite-modules.js#L21). This prevented us from running tests with other `NODE_ENV` values.\r\n\r\nSince we dropped Haste and no longer use `rewrite-modules`, we can now run tests with any environment value. I'm changing this to `'development'` now but will later introduce a `'production'` mode separately.",
