  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nReport a bug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nReact 16.9.0 deprecates `javascript:` URLs (@sebmarkbage in #15047). It was motivated by preventing XSS vulnerability that can be used by injecting client-side scripts:\r\n```jsx\r\n<a href={url}>Unsafe Link</a>\r\n```\r\nThe following code cannot be exploited by attackers, it cannot be used to inject XSS:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\">Safe Link</a>\r\n```\r\nReact 16.9 reports the security precaution warning for the example:\r\n```\r\nWarning: A future version of React will block javascript: URLs as a security precaution. Use event handlers instead if you can. If you need to generate unsafe HTML try using dangerouslySetInnerHTML instead. React was passed \"javascript:void(0)\".\r\n```\r\n[![Edit determined-rgb-sws4g](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/determined-rgb-sws4g?fontsize=14)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would expected that security precaution warnings aren't reported for values that cannot be controlled by attackers.\r\n\r\nThere were also [concerns](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15047/files#r264357918) regarding common patterns like `javascript:void(0)`, see @gaearon comment:\r\n> Especially javascript:void(0) seems like it's still pretty common because it's copy pasted from old samples etc. Is it dangerous to whitelist that one? Is it a vector by itself?\r\n\r\nIf there're tons of reported security issues, you definitely ignore something important.\r\n\r\nFor reference: [Angularâ€™s cross-site scripting security model](https://angular.io/guide/security#angulars-cross-site-scripting-security-model)\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.9.0 is affected. 16.8.6 doesn't report the warning.\r\n",
