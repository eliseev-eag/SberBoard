Or the nativeEvent type for that matter.\n\nNeeds to be added in here somewhere: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/3a4e1dbb5b2957875cab6af11a5e5934e125a0d8/src/test/ReactTestUtils.js#L496\n\nI realize that it's not sustainable to have to set _all_ the possible fields for a simulated event, but the type at least makes sense for verification that you're getting the right _sort_ of event.\n",
