  "body": "This is just me overthinking it coming from jQuery, but googling how to submit a form gave me nothing, so I thought I'd add this.\n\nOur use case was solved when I took a step back and just put a submit button into the form (which is why I included that example as well), but I can see use cases for programmatically doing it, in all cases when a form is submitted without user input, or at least where the input is not pressing a button/link. And as mentioned, googling didn't give me anything.\n",
