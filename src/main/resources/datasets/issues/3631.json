  "body": "I'm trying to integrate some animations into my React project and its becoming quite a struggle.\n\nFor example, I have an error message component that should fade in an out. What I'd like to do is fade out the old message and fade in the new one. I'm doing all my animations with javascript. The main problem is that I can't fade out the previous error because `componentWillUpdate` is sync. I think it would make sense for any lifecycle methods that have \"Will\" in the name to have async callbacks.\n\nThis is what I'd like to do:\n\n``` coffee\nReact.createClass\n  displayName: 'Error'\n  mixins: [React.addons.PureRenderMixin]\n  animateIn: ->\n    $(@refs.error.getDOMNode()).velocity('transition.fadeIn', {display:null})\n  animateOut: (done)->\n    $(@refs.error.getDOMNode()).velocity('transition.fadeOut', {display:null, complete:done})\n  componentDidMount: ->\n    @animateIn()\n  componentDidUpdate: ->\n    @animateIn()\n  componentWillUpdate: (done) ->\n    @animateOut(done)\n  render: ->\n    (div {className: 'error', ref:'error', children:@props.children})\n```\n",
