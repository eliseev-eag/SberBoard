  "body": "Losing this in 0.13.X broke Om applications like CircleCI that used this to maintain an snapshot of their entire application (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yHFTN-_mOo). This permitted full serialization and deserialization of all React app state including transient component local state between browsers (powerful for testing purposes) without forcing programmers to write non-modular code via world passing.\n\nWhile it's understandable that people might rely on the specifics of the handle, we just need some opaque identifier. We don't care about the actual representation of the handle.\n\nThis may well be out of scope. But it would be nice for this issue to get some consideration and official feedback.\n",
