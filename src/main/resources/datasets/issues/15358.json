  "body": "The new suspense model is based on the last \"event time\" that influenced the suspended render.\r\n\r\nThe \"event time\" is the time of the \"update\" (root render, setState, dispatch) - which we infer from its expiration time.\r\n\r\nIf this is a \"retry\", then there is no \"update\" and the event time is the time we committed the fallback. This event time is only accounted for if we actually switch from fallback to content, i.e. make progress. If we retry and don't make further progress, then this event time isn't accounted for.\r\n\r\nTo make the math simple and fast, I model the committed time as an \"normal pri expiration time\" at the time it committed.\r\n\r\nSince there can be multiple updates and retries in the same batch, we use the most recent time for our heuristic. That ensures that we at least never wait longer than we otherwise would've.\r\n\r\nSince we can't tell the difference between committed and suspended updates, this PR will error on the side of including committed updates.\r\n\r\nFor now, I still use the hard coded 150ms suspense time starting from the event time. In a follow up, I'll add the Just Noticeable Difference heuristic instead.",
