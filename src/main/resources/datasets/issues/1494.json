  "body": "I know it previously switched from `<noscript />` because it was unreliable, but `<script />` seems to suffer from similar issues, repro: http://dev.cetrez.com/jsx/2/scriptfail.html\n\nI went through all the different elements (`link`, `meta`, etc), but none of them seems to work, so `<span />` is seemingly the best alternative it seems to me, especially since it is already kind of special in React (i.e, React can wrap text in `<span />`). But it's not great.\n",
