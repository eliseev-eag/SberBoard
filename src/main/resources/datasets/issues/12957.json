  "body": "If an error is thrown, and there's lower priority work, it's possible the lower priority work will fix the error. Retry at the lower priority.\r\n\r\nIf an error is thrown and there's no more work to try, handle the error like we normally do (trigger the nearest error boundary).\r\n\r\nThis does not handle expiration correctly. If a priority level is suspended due to an error, the lower priority work should expire at the time of the suspended work. I'll work on this in a subsequent PR.",
