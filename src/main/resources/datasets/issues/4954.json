  "body": "When given a `component` prop `ReactTransitionGroup` will pass the prop on. \n\nWhen passing `ReactTransitionGroup` a factory for a component that also uses a `component` prop in similar fashion it will result in a warning:\n\n```\nWarning: Failed propType: Invalid prop `component` supplied to `CustomComponent`.\nCheck the render method of `ReactTransitionGroup`.\n```\n\nIs there a legitimate use for not consuming the prop? This doubles as a problem since it causes a warning _and_ requires that any component which can be a child of `ReactTransitionGroup` must also make sure that it's component prop doesn't equal itself.\n\nWhoops, forgot that this exists in 0.14.0-rc1.\n",
