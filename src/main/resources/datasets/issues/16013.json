  "body": "Read this PR with `?w=1`\r\n\r\n(I had an older version of this PR, made a fresh one to get out of conflict hell)\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `act()` by default to react-test-renderer's `.create`, `.update`, and `.unmount` methods.\r\n\r\nWe risk a major breaking change with having added warnings on unqueued effects outside of an act scope. Eg: A lot of people's snapshot tests will break; this would be good, if they didn't have to first wrap their renderer helper with `act()`, and then update snapshots.\r\n\r\nBroadly, we could also make a case why this makes sense to any consumers; they'll be using it only in testing scenarios, which we'd want to wrap in `act()` anyway\r\n\r\nFor our internal tests, this had the effect that a larger portion of the test was just wrapped with an outer `act()`, letting us test incremental updates by advancing the `Scheduler` manually.\r\n",
