  "body": "When a `ReactCSSTransitionGroup` is used without timeout props, it [warns](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/addons/transitions/ReactCSSTransitionGroup.js#L28-L33):\n\n> Warning: Failed propType: transitionLeaveTimeout wasn't supplied to ReactCSSTransitionGroup: this can cause unreliable animations and won't be supported in a future version of React. See https://fb.me/react-animation-transition-group-timeout for more information. Check the render method of `Constructor`.\n\nfor each missing timeout prop. However, that URL simply points to [the Getting Started section of the Animation page](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html#getting-started). The code listed there does use timeout props, but nothing on the page explains what those props do or why they're necessary. In fact, the word \"timeout\" only appears in the names of those props in code examples.\n\nCould we get some explanation in the docs, please?\n",
