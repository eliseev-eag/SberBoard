  "body": "Updated is API is `Resource.read(key)` instead of `Resource.read(cache, key)`.\r\n\r\nThe cache is read from context using `readContext`.\r\n\r\nThis also removes cache invalidation entirely (other than the default LRU mechanism), as well as the ability to have multiple caches. We'll add it back once `Context.write` (some version of #13293) lands and we can implement it the right way.\r\n\r\nSince there's now only a single cache (the global one), we don't actually need to use context yet, but I've added a dummy context anyway so the user gets an error if they attempt to read outside the render phase.",
