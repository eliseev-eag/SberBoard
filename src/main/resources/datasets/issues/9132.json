  "body": "I believe that List should be able to interface with ListItem's props\r\n```\r\nParent\r\n  List\r\n    ListItem\r\n    ListItem\r\n    ListItem\r\n```\r\n\r\n* The Parent knows which ListItems to display in List\r\n* ListItem props are declared in Parent, but the Parent should not have to manage the ListItems, and I don't know how the List can directly interface with ListItems instead\r\n\r\n```\r\n// ----- in a parent class, defining a list and the list's components ------->\r\n\r\nrender () {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div id='parent'>\r\n      <List onComponentSelected={this.doSomething}>\r\n        <Component1 />\r\n        <Component2 />\r\n        <Component3 />\r\n      </List>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI was thinking about sending the class names as props, and having List instantiate them, but there doesn't seem to be a way to do this with a dynamic JSX class  -- `<{this.props.classes[0]}/>` ??\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI saw that `cloneElement` is promoted, but I cannot seem to update a cloned element's props after the initial construction. I'm updating the child styles 60 times per second, and don't want to clone an object for no reason, but this may be the cost of React",
