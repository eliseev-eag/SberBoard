  "body": "We're writing a WYSIWYG editor in React, and in order to place a cursor inside the rich document we use `contentEditable`. Understandably, React doesn't fare well with contentEditable - to get around the framework's confusion once contentEditable children are modified, we force re-renders with new keys and do other work to restore the selection. In practice, we have this working pretty well.\n\nWith 0.12, we're getting the new warning:\n\n> A component is `contentEditable` and contains `children` managed by React. It is now your responsibility to guarantee that none of these nodes are unexpectedly modified or duplicated. This is probably not intentional.\n\nIn our case, we do guarantee that nodes are unexpectedly modified or duplicated, and it is intentional. Is there any way to suppress that warning? Unlike the Factory warning, this warning appears each time the component is instantiated (I think) - at the very least, it slowly fills up our consoles.\n\n(We've considered an alternative of not using children on the contentEditable, and on component update we set the `innerHTML` outside of React - this would likely sidestep the warning, but not get us much else.)\n",
