  "body": "*TLDR: I’m removing `react/lib/checkPropTypes` import in favor of `React.checkPropTypes` public API access from renderer, and direct `checkPropTypes` access from the core.*\r\n\r\nShared `checkReactTypeSpec` currently depends on `react/lib/checkPropTypes` which is gone in flat bundles. So this breaks in React Native sync process. In DOM, we currently ship two copies (in both React and ReactDOM flat bundles) but this breaks until RN is also a flat bundle. I could shim it but this seems like an easy fix because there’s a public API for this now.\r\n\r\nThe fix inside React package is just to import the internal `checkPropTypes` module directly.\r\nThe fix inside renderers is to use the public API (`React.checkPropTypes`).",
