  "body": "This PR adds a doc page about [render prop](https://cdb.reacttraining.com/use-a-render-prop-50de598f11ce)s; a really useful means for resolving cross-cutting concerns in React apps without [the caveats of higher-order components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/higher-order-components.html#caveats).\r\n\r\nThis pattern is widely used in several popular React libraries including [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) and [React Motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion), and I often get feedback from people at our [React Training](https://reacttraining.com) workshops who wonder why the pattern is missing from the official React docs.\r\n\r\nThis description is by no means perfect, and I'm open to feedback about how I can improve it. But I tried to keep it simple w/out contradicting too much of what the current docs say about HOCs. I'd be happy to hear your feedback :)",
