  "body": "I'm not sure if this is the right repo to ask this question in, but I figured I'd start somewhere.\n\nI am working on an app that uses react-router and redux. Using a library called react-redux which exposes a decorator to wrap the component and pass in data from the store as props. So the component that gets passed to ReactTransitionGroup is actually a class called Connect, which has a property called WrappedComponent where the actual component lives. Since all the ReactTransitionGroup lifecycle methods are inplemented on the WrappedComponent, ReactTransitionGroup is not finding them.\n\nI tired extending ReactTransitionGroup and overriding the perform and _handle methods to also look for the lifecycle methods on WrappedComponent, but I get the following error:\n\n```\nUnhandled promise rejection ReferenceError: ReactTransitionChildMapping is not defined\n```\n\nHere is a gist of the extended class I created:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/duro/c58d21cf3183ae01c786\n\nIf anyone could point me in the right direction, I would appreciate it.\n\nThanks!\n",
