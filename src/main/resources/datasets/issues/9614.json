This should work for anything including default HTML element types.\r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPropTypes.getPropTypes('span');\r\nPropTypes.getPropTypes(MyComponent);\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven better would be if it worked with elements as well, but that seems like you could just hit the element's prototype.\r\n\r\nCurrently I can't find a good way to do an \"extension\" and retain the prop types of the default component, and/or a way to get prop types from HTML elements.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n\"react-dom\": \"^15.5.4\"",
