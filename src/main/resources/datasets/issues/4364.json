  "body": "(**[edit-2]**)  The particular SVG sub-issue related in this intial post is solved; there is a different SVG issue related in post (this thread) July 15/16.  I should have opened a different issue, even though both relate to Chrome and SVG, they are not the same issue.\n\n(**[edit-1]** Findings: It is SVG related , sort of . When doing variable assignments from a function from within `render`, the return values may be parsed into span elements, which, when inside SVG, logically cause blow-up.  So, generally, the issue now is how to generally still be able to compute usefull things from within `render` without having those vals turned into fodder for spans.)\n\n(**[edit-0]** I still think this bug is SVG related but it is not limited to path elements, as [`minesweeper_001.coffee`](https://github.com/Terebinth/Vickers/blob/master/lib/minesweeper/minesweeper_001_.coffee) has same bug (Chromium only not Firefox) but no path command.)\n\nThis is a \"Danger: Discarding unexpected node\" error in Chromium which breaks render destroying app.  In Firefox no problems.  It's with SVG path command.\n\n```\n[...]\n    render: ->\n        rayy_000 = for i in [0 .. 7]\n            i = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n        svg\n            width: '100%'\n            height: '100%'\n            ,\n            mb = @main_board_001()\n            path\n                d: \"M30 40 L40 50\"\n                stroke: 'black'\n[...]\n```\n\nIn Firefox this renders fine, in Chromium I get a \"Danger: Discarding unexpected node\" warning and no render.\n\n```\nDanger: Discarding unexpected node: <span data-reactid=​\".0.0.0\">​…​</span>​\nDanger: Discarding unexpected node: <path d=​\"M30 40 L40 50\" stroke=​\"black\" data-reactid=​\".0.0.1\">​</path>​\n```\n\nfull file and project for context at [test.coffee](https://github.com/Terebinth/Vickers/blob/chromium_bug/lib/chromium_testing/test.coffee)\n",
