  "body": "In `cloneFiber`, we always copy the `memoizedProps` from current. That means we lose the memoization of the progressed work.\r\n\r\nThis bug manifests itself in several ways. The simplest example is that if we resume mounting a partially rendered tree, we can't reuse any of the progressed work, because the current `memoizedProps` is null.\r\n\r\nI believe the reason we didn't discover this flaw earlier is because we don't implement memoization correctly, and the cloned current props end up being used to memoize the `progressedChild`. Which happens to work in many cases, even though it's incorrect.\r\n\r\nIn addition to fixing the bugs, we may want to consider adding a `progressedProps` (and `progressedState`) field to the Fiber type.",
