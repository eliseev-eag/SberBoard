  "body": "**Browser**: Chrome 51, Mac\n\nI have a React component that includes both an `onKeyDown()` and `onChange()` function. The component renders (among other things) an `<input />` with these functions as props. \n\n**Unexpected behavior:** Without breakpoints from Chrome debugger, both functions run correctly. However, when there is a breakpoint introduced into the `onKeyDown()` method, the `onChange()` function is _entirely skipped._ I am not sure if this is an intended consequence of how synthetic events are reused, but it seems unexpected to me.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:** \n1. [JSfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/48909/)\n2. Open dev tools; note that `onChange()` never runs\n3. Comment out `debugger;`, note that now `onChange()` runs\n",
