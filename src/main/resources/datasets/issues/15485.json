  "body": "This PR contains a selection of bug fixes for the experimental event API. Notably:\r\n\r\n- The `commitEventTarget` and `onMount` renderer callbacks are now called during the lifecycle phase so that we now can properly access the element after it's been attached to the document.\r\n- Fixed a typo in detection of `zIndex` checking.\r\n- Updated all tests to properly account for the functionality now working correctly.\r\n- Fixed `Press` handling of hit targets. It was broken before and was allowing `mouse` and `pen` events to incorrectly trigger the event target. Furthermore, the `focus` event is now correctly blocked.",
