  "body": "React is supposed to warn about \"unknown props\" as described here https://reactjs.org/warnings/unknown-prop.html\r\n\r\nIt looks like I have a bug or edge case condition that there's some unknown props but react emits no warnings!!!\r\n\r\nRight not I dont have steps to reproduce, but I have some screenshots, Ill take a look later for \"steps\" if Im ever able to reproduce this in some simple way\r\n\r\n1. No warnings in the console \r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/fWkxBlX.png\r\n\r\n2. This is technically an \"unknown prop\"\r\nThe w=\"250px\"  https://i.imgur.com/vf4ZUac.png\r\nif that's not enough maybe what about the  'mt=10px'  https://i.imgur.com/bbioGTE.png also look https://i.imgur.com/zBPmvCM.png\r\n\r\n-------- \r\n\r\nI tried to search for an open issue, is this known? I should try to figure out what the heck is going on?\r\n\r\nThanks",
