  "body": "React Native currently uses the context API to warn about invalid nesting of `Text` and `View` components. Some of this is currently necessary because of [conditional logic like this](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/Text/Text.js#L218-L222). Other parts could be moved here though (like `View` warning if it's within a `Text` ancestor) in order to remove the necessity of using an extra `Context.Consumer` component. Planned changes to React Native may also allow for moving other `Context.Consumer` components from the JS side, which would make this warning approach more attractive.\r\n\r\ncc @yungsters",
