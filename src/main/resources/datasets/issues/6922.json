  "body": "Suppose I render a table in some react component and want to add some features to it:\n- Make its columns resizable\n- Bind several keypress events (up/down to highlight, shift+up/down to select, enter to do some processing etc.)\n\nNone of these tasks have anything to do with react aspect of the component (states, props, component lifecycle etc).\n\nIn such a scenario, where will I write the \"UI features\" code?\n1. Inside `Component.jsx`\n2. In some other `component.js` file and import it in corresponding jsx file\n3. Some other place entirely\n\nPlease advise.\n",
