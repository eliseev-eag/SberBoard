  "body": "In either raw React, or JSX, it seems that children can be passed as a property of the props object, instead of the documented methods (separate parameter in React.createElement, or enclosed by the component tags in JSX). I encountered this syntax in a book, and was rather confused, because the book provided no explanation on this syntax, and nor can I find it mentioned anywhere in the React documentation. Intuitively, it can be _expected_ to work, because it is documented that children is available as a propery of the props object, but it should be documented that the reverse is possible as well - _passing_ children as props.children. If it's actually _not_ supported, perhaps this should be explicitly mentioned in the docs, as a deprecated feature or something?\r\nI also asked about this on Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/44042305/element-children-show-despite-not-being-passed",
