  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThe current synthetic keyboard event does not support the [`KeyboardEvent.code`](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents/#dom-keyboardevent-code) property.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe synthetic keyboard event should pass along the [`KeyboardEvent.code`](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents/#dom-keyboardevent-code) property. This is currently in the WD of DOM Events but is part of replacing `keyCode` and `charCode` and is much more consistent and easy to use. This is currently only supported by FF and Chrome ([CanIUse](https://caniuse.com/#feat=keyboardevent-code)) so it may be a bit premature to fully integrate. However `keyCode`, `charCode` and `which` are being deprecated so this will eventually need to be added.\r\n\r\nEdit: I spoke too quickly, CanIUse shows that FF, Chrome, Safari and Opera support it. IE, Edge and most mobile browsers do not.\r\n",
