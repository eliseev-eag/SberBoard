  "body": "Real Maps should now be used in RN JS engines. In theory this should be faster (but might not actually be in practice), and it avoids hitting upper bounds of property max counts.\r\n\r\n~I haven't actually tested since we don't have integration tests in this repo.~ I actually failed some initial tests so we at least have some coverage here. Will need to be tested when we do a sync.\r\n\r\nThe case that I could imagine would be different is that this no longer ToStrings the keys so if there are some string keys getting passed here, they would no longer match. Nothing should do that though.\r\n\r\nWe don't use these types of Maps in Fabric.",
