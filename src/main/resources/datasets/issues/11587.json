  "body": "Avoiding side effects in the will-mount/will-update/etc lifecycle hooks becomes very important with async rendering. Unfortunately it's not always easy to detect. This PR adds 2 new feature flags (both disabled by default) to help with this. These flags invoke methods that are supposed to be side-effect-free a second time, roughly approximating what happens when React throws away incomplete work.\r\n\r\nBefore I started this, I planned to repeat the whole begin phase (eg: _cWRP -> sCU -> cWU -> cWRP -> sCU -> cWU -> render_) rather than just individual methods (eg _cWRP -> cWRP -> sCU -> sCU -> cWU -> cWU -> render_). That looks to be more complicated than I had assumed though, and I'm not convinced it's worth the extra effort and complexity. (Since these methods should not have side effects, it should be okay to call them in either sequence.) Happy to discuss this more in depth if others disagree though!\r\n\r\nOnce these flags are approved, my next step will be to connect them to a GK for the Facebook internal builds, similar to `enableAsyncSchedulingByDefaultInReactDOM`.",
