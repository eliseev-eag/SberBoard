  "body": "This is related to #11299 \r\n\r\nI've reimplemented the previous tests using only the public API, but I'm uncertain about their coverage. It doesn't check things like `setData` and `getData` behavior on the `clipboardData` (`DataTransfer`) object, for instance. We would actually rely on implementation mocks to test these things anyway, since there's no implementation of `Range` on `jsdom` and `DataTransfer` doesn't have a constructor.",
