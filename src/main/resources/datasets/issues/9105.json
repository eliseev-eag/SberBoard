This mirrors the logic in the commit phase.\r\n\r\nTo verify, I ran the same code with the new bundle, and now only class fibers with corresponding lifecycles are scheduled in the effect list:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"352\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-03-03 at 7 45 09 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/810438/23566593/875046ea-004a-11e7-9973-3e201b2a0aff.png\">\r\n\r\nThis is a perf optimization and is unobservable from tests.",
