  "body": "<!--\r\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\r\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a bug?**\r\n\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI have an Input component that uses `useState()` to handle the state of its floating label, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst FloatingLabelInput = props => {\r\n  const {\r\n    value = ''\r\n  } = props\r\n\r\n  const [floatingLabel, toggleFloatingLabel] = useState(value !== '')\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have a series of those components and you'd expect `initialFloatingLabel` and `floatingLabel` to be always the same, but they're not for some of them! I can see by logging the values:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  const initialFloatingLabel = value !== ''\r\n  console.log(initialFloatingLabel)\r\n  const [floatingLabel, toggleFloatingLabel] = useState(initialFloatingLabel)\r\n  console.log(floatingLabel)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a result some of the components have the label in floating state (Postcode and Address Line 1) when they shouldn't (because they're empty), like this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"524\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-09-12 at 12 17 39\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1765942/64780453-4ef49180-d558-11e9-8dd9-9f7dbe362aff.png\">\r\n\r\nA very interesting fact is that, if I reorder the fields, it will always be the two first fields that are affected, like in the image above.\r\n\r\nThese fields are part of a multi-step form (using [Formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik)) and the steps are handled by a state machine (using [xstate](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate)) library. This problem happens only on Step 2. If I set the machine to start on step 2 on app load, this will not happen.\r\n\r\nThat's on Google Chrome - on Safari, a different subset of fields are affected. There is consistency on which fields are affected in each browser though (if I don't change their order)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIf you pass an initial value to `useState()`, the state variable should always be equal to that:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue)\r\n```\r\n\r\n(```value``` must _always_ be equal to ```initialValue```)\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact: Version 16.8.5\r\nGoogle Chrome: Version 76.0.3809.132\r\nOS: MacOS Mojave Version 10.14.1\r\n",
