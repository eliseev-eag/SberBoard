  "body": "There are valid use cases for not wanting to use keys, if you e.g. render strongly differing trees (like e.g. blog posts) or have a function that returns always the same array of items.\r\n\r\nWhen you don’t provide an explicit key, React will internally use the index as key and emit a warning – however you would want to silence the warning, as using the index here is perfectly valid.\r\n\r\nThis doesn’t currently seem to be possible however, which has the sad consequence that you either have to make your code more complex for no reason (manually adding useless keys) or you have to live with the warnings (which means that valid warnings might be lost among the noise).\r\n\r\nThe [article](https://medium.com/@robinpokorny/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern-e0349aece318) quoted in the [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys) states the conditions in which using the default behavior is valid:\r\n\r\n> 1. the list and items are static–they are not computed and do not change;\r\n> 2. the items in the list have no ids;\r\n> 3. the list is never reordered or filtered.",
