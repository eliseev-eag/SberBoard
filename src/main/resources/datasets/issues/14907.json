  "body": "As part of https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/72 this adds a new top level API on ReactNative that we can use to setNativeProps.\r\n\r\nThis can only be called with a ref to a native component and will warn/no-op if called with an invalid component ref.\r\n\r\nOther than jest tests, I also verified this worked by running \r\n```\r\nyarn build native --type=RN_FB_DEV\r\n```\r\nand copied the output files into FB's codebase. I added a console.warn to ensure it was using the renderer I copied in, modified `react-native-implementation.js` to expose this and then verified `setNativeProps` worked correctly from the top level for the paper renderer via a playground app.",
