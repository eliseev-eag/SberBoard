  "body": "* Makes Code/Result split 70/30 rather than 50/50 to remove the line wrapping.\r\n* Switches the font from the default system monospace font to the one we used. I find it a *lot* more legible. The extremely thin lines are very hard to read for some people including me, and hurt accessibility.\r\n* Adds back the easter egg that switches the gendered name on every refresh. IMO it was cool :-)\r\n* Formats the examples closer to how mainstream JS community does it, to reduce even the slightest knee jerk reactions, and in some cases makes the lines shorter.\r\n",
