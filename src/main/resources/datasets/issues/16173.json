  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nRequest a feature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nBundling react-dom with the current CJS module is _HUGE_ - 124KB of stuff we don't use.\r\nThe bundle can be so much smaller by adding the source files into the npm package and enabling users to do a proper tree-shaking by defining the file in webpack\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1608474/61644207-ceba5a00-ac93-11e9-80b5-84537a938c9d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nWhen bundling with webpack, we should be able to properly tree-shake the unused code automatically.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16.8.6\r\nBrowser Chrome 75\r\nLinux ",
