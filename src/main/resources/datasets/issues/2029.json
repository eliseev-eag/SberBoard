  "body": "I really like React; but I kinda hate JavaScript due to lack of typing. TypeScript looks good; but the 3rd party bindings are truly terrible (constantly breaking, and generally not versioned at all well).\n\nThe immutable JS collections released recently by Facebook include TypeScript bindings; which fills us with hope that maybe the same might happen for React. Please, make it so :)\n\nI'm aware JSX won't work with TypeScript; that's no big loss; I prefer pure script, it plays nicer with existing JS tools.\n",
