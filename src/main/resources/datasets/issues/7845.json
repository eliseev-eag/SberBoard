  "body": "**What is the current behavior?**\nUsing web components with React is cumbersome, as properties such as `className` are being copied as attributes without transforming them to `class`. [A lot](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4933#issuecomment-145951830) has been said about this, but it can be very confusing for developers who are trying to use web components using React.\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nMuch like how using `class` as a property logs a warning, I suggest that if a property key exists in `DOMProperty.properties` we raise a similar when warning when `__DEV__` is `true`, so the user knows that what is happening is expected behavior, not a bug.\n\nIf my proposal is acceptable, I have a PR that is ready to be sent out. \n\nThoughts?\n",
