This limits possible ways in which it could be used and requires to additionally use other hooks to derive the state:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass App extends Component {\r\n  state = {}\r\n\r\n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {\r\n    return { error }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {\r\n    // do we really need this?\r\n    // the state is derived from error, not props\r\n    if (state.error)\r\n      return remapStateToPreferredStructure(state);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() { /* ... */ }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n`getDerivedStateFromError` is expected to receive previous state and have\r\n\r\n```\r\ngetDerivedStateFromError(error, state)\r\n```\r\nsignature to be consistent with related static hook, `getDerivedStateFromProps`. This `getDerivedStateFromError` signature is backward compatible with existing one (React 16.6.0).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
