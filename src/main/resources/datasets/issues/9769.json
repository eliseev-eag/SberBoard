  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nClicking on an element to set focus allows the onPaste handler to be invoked as expected. When you apply focus to an element using the [HTMLElement.focus](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus) method, the onPaste handler is not invoked.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\n[jsFiddle here](https://jsfiddle.net/bkilrain/69z2wepo/79420/)\r\n\r\n1. Open the console on the jsFiddle\r\n2. Click on yellow div to focus\r\n3. Use keyboard (ctrl/cmd-V) or edit menu to fire paste event\r\n4. Notice paste event logged in console as expected\r\n5. Click on input element to focus\r\n6. Press an arrow key to set focus on yellow div programmatically\r\n7. Use keyboard (ctrl/cmd-V) or edit menu to fire paste event\r\n8. Notice no paste event logged in console\r\n\r\nYou can double check the paste event is firing using dev tools.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI expect the event handler to be invoked regardless of how focus is applied to the element\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 15.5.4\r\nReact 15.4 \r\n\r\nTested on macOS 10.12.5 w/ Chrome v 58.0.3029.110 (64-bit)\r\n",
