  "body": "This PR adds a handful of server rendering unit tests.\r\n\r\nWith the move to Fiber, it's likely that the server rendering path and client rendering path are going to diverge significantly, and I think it'd be useful to have a more robust unit test suite for server rendering as the work on Fiber SSR begins.\r\n\r\nThis PR starts to port over tests that I wrote in (since abandoned) PR #6836. This PR only ports over some of the helper functions and 4 of the simplest tests. If this PR is accepted, I plan to submit the rest of the tests in a series of further PRs; I only added four tests here because I wanted to keep this PR as digestible as possible.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your great work!\r\n\r\nNote: I ran tests, linting, and flow, but I could not get `./scripts/fiber/record-tests` to work. It first complained about not being able to find `jest-cli`; when I npm installed jest-cli, it complained about an unresolved Promise with the error `TypeError: Path must be a string. Received undefined`.  I expect the CI build will fail on this, and I'd appreciate any pointers to getting it to work.",
