Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n``` javascript\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport { act } from 'react-dom/test-utils';\r\nimport { mount } from 'enzyme';\r\nimport { getPointsFromGroupID } from './utils/getPointsFromGroupID';\r\nimport { TDashBody } from '.';\r\n\r\njest.mock('./utils/getPointsFromGroupID', () => ({\r\n  getPointsFromGroupID: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve({})),\r\n}));\r\n\r\nconst getDefaultProps = () => ({\r\n  currentGroup: 0,\r\n});\r\ndescribe('DashBody', () => {\r\n  let component;\r\n  beforeEach(() => {\r\n    act(() => {\r\n      const props = getDefaultProps();\r\n      component = mount(<TDashBody {...props} />);\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n  describe('rendering', () => {\r\n    it('Should render without exploding', () => {\r\n      expect(component).toBeDefined();\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThis test passes, but the placement of the mock module call gives me the act() error\r\n```\r\nWarning: An update to TDashBody inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).\r\n\r\n      When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into act(...):\r\n\r\n      act(() => {\r\n        /* fire events that update state */\r\n      });\r\n      /* assert on the output */\r\n\r\n      This ensures that you're testing the behavior the user would see in the browser. Learn more at https://fb\r\n\r\n.me/react-wrap-tests-with-act\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nv16.8.1 running chrome on windows 10",
