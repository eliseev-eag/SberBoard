Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons:\r\n1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM)\r\n2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks\r\n3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app\r\nSee https://fb.me/react-invalid-hook-call for tips about how to debug and fix this problem.\r\n  at N (/react@16.8.6/umd/react.production.min.js:9:413)\r\n  at q (/react@16.8.6/umd/react.production.min.js:10:177)\r\n  at m (/react@16.8.6/umd/react.production.min.js:17:159)\r\n  at useContext (/react@16.8.6/umd/react.production.min.js:30:482)\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe browser is always some variant of \"Apple Mail\", such as `Apple Mail 605.1.15`\r\n\r\nWe haven't been able to reproduce this, so I'm unsure of what's causing these issues.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nHaven't been able to reproduce, only going off what's being reported to Sentry.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nNo errors.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16.8.6, started happening as soon as we started using hooks in our codebase. Haven't seen any issues with any other browsers.",
