It should default to the timeout of the parent.\r\n\r\nA \"continuation\" is a callback that is scheduled when yielding\r\nexecution. It's scheduled by returning a callback from the parent. It\r\nshould have the same timeout as the parent, and because it's a\r\ncontinuation, it should be inserted into the queue before callbacks of\r\nequal priority (not after, as callbacks are usually scheduled).\r\n\r\nExample of a continuation:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction performWork(deadline) {\r\n  while (tasks.length > 0) {\r\n    const task = tasks.shift();\r\n    doTask(task);\r\n    if (\r\n      tasks.length > 0 &&\r\n      !deadline.didTimeout &&\r\n      deadline.timeRemaining() <= 0\r\n    ) {\r\n      // Ran out of time. Yield and\r\n      // continue later.\r\n      return performWork;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nscheduleWork(performWork);\r\n```",
