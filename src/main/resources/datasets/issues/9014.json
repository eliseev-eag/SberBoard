  "body": "First time reading about react, and I thought the docs were wrong when they said that onChange is fired on every keystroke, since the HTML change event is only fired when focus changes. Looks like the docs are right, but I think they ought to be clarified. I've attempted the clarification here, but a cross reference to something more authoritative about React's changes to HTML events would be good, too.\r\n",
