  "body": "I was able to come up with a repro for this bug that does not rely on weird interactions between JS and Flash, though it only happens in Firefox: http://jsfiddle.net/bzrppsym/3/\n\nA summary of the repro is that if you have a React component that is updating itself via a setInterval loop and an INPUT that is focused, and you zoom in/out to trigger a resize handler which re-renders the React component, the error is triggered.\n\n**Note**: that this only happens in Firefox and if the INPUT is focused. This does not seem to happen in Chrome. The same workaround suggested in #4958 also applies, i.e. wrapping the resize handler body in a setTimeout.\n",
