  "body": "Hi all,\n\nI'm trying to figure out as to whether this is: the wrong way to do it or a React issue.\n\nHow do you deal with two mixins pulling state from different stores and trying to be mixed into the same view?\n\n[Here's a gist showcasing the issue](https://gist.github.com/dariocravero/3d56bec82ee96c4d7684).\n\nGiven two mixins:\n\n```\nvar Mixin1  = {\n  getState: function() {\n    return {\n      mixin1: true,\n      shared: 'mixin1'\n    };\n  }\n}\nvar Mixin2  = {\n  getState: function() {\n    return {\n      mixin2: true,\n      shared: 'mixin2'\n    };\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd a view that uses them:\n\n```\nvar View = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [\n    Mixin1,\n    Mixin2\n  ],\n\n  render: function() {\n    return <div>A view</div>;\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThe view fails with `Uncaught Error: Invariant Violation: ReactCompositeComponentInterface: You are attempting to define`getState`on your component more than once. This conflict may be due to a mixin.`.\n\nIs this the wrong approach? Or maybe a React issue?\n\nWhen Googling the symptoms I found this facebook/react#375 but it's not strictly related, plus there doesn't seem to be any default spec policy being enforced for multiple definitions.\n\nThanks!\nDar√≠o\n",
