  "body": "<!--\r\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\r\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nI think it's a question, but this could be a bug. \r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI'm using redux, so state mutations aren't done. Everything comes in on props.\r\nIf you implement an ErrorBoundary using redux, you can get pretty far until you start getting the warning: \"Warning: ErrorBoundary: Error boundaries should implement getDerivedStateFromError(). In that method, return a state update to display an error message or fallback UI.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as I implement this method it stops calling componentDidCatch. I don't want to use the derived version since that expects me to use state. \r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nI can't post my code but if this sounds valid I will make a code pen example. I'm very new to react/redux. \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhy do I have to implement both? It seems like having to use state isn't considering redux apps. \r\nI would expect implementing one or the other is fine, or to be able to return null from the derived version. \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n",
