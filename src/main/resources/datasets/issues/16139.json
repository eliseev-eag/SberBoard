  "body": "This change is being made to enable DevTools to eagerly patch the console (before a renderer has been attached to the frontend) so that e.g. React Native developers can still get component stacks even if they aren't using the DevTools UI.\r\n\r\nWe don't strictly _need_ to inject these methods, but since the logic for getting the display name of a component is tied to the renderer version, this simplifies things for DevTools.\r\n\r\nAt this point, it would be much easier to just inject `ReactDebugCurrentFrame` and let it create the stacks for us- _but_ that would prevent DevTools from being able to create an owners-only stack, which I think is rather nice to have.",
