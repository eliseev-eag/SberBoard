The only way to do it is to wrap the rendered component to an error boundary, throw a dummy error and pass `componentStack` to the rendered component without throwing the error again.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082083/44995658-cb9b7a00-afac-11e8-83da-6b60f6edb6e6.png)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the idea of hiding thrown errors was refused (see https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11098) so this experimental hack isn't useful. \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI'd like to deterministically identify components at DOM tree and use this data to assign persistent data to it without using any custom identifiers. For example store visibility state for a specific component at window.localStorage. \r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1137\r\n",
