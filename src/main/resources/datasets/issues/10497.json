  "body": "Biggest issue about patent clause - https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191 - was closed with a statement:\r\n\r\n\" I'll close this out for now but let's keep the broader discussion going\"\r\n\r\nYet there is no link or suggestion where such discussion might take place. This puts users of React in a position of weakness, since there is no central place to articulate their issues/problems with a clause.\r\n\r\nI thus would like to ask to either always keep **one** issue about the topic open, so that people can speak up, or provide **maintained** link to the discussion thread on some other platform.\r\n\r\nI understand that this is not a best place for such discussions, but topic is very important for users and businesses they work on, so not having single place to continue discussion can be only interpreted as (unfortunately) silencing tactic.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** As far as I understand, you can actually close issue, but still leave it open for adding comments. Yet adding comments in issue about patent clause was turned off. @sebmarkbage could you elaborate why this was necessary (since you leave comments option on in all other closed issues) and how this relates to \"let's keep the broader discussion going\"?",
