  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI just run into an issue with controlled password fields when adding user tracking software to my app. Generally speaking, such trackers are going to claim that they don't capture text inputs. They achieve that by simply ignoring values of `change` events, they'll still however record the fact that the event has occurred, together with a selector uniquely identifying it's target.\r\n\r\nWhen an input is controlled, the value attribute in the markup is going to change, resulting in a tracking software capturing it as part of the selector (`.some-input[type=\"password\"][value=\"mypassword\"]`), which brings me to my question: what are the security implications of having the value accessible not only via `HTMLInputElement.value`, but also by the virtue of parsing the markup?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nK",
