Native \"input\" input event is called for both numbers and the letter \"e\". With React the `onChange` event is only called for numbers. There's no way to catch \"e\" with `onChange`.\r\n\r\nThe \"e\" is even being filled when the input is controlled. The only way I can think of to work around this bug right now is to use `onKeyDown` and `preventDefault` when \"e\" or \"E\" is pressed.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/ov3ql3ljwz\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt should pass anything that is being filled into the input to the onChange handler and should not break controlled component.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact: 16.4.2\r\nChrome: 68.0.3440.106\r\nWindows 10",
