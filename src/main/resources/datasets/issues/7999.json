  "body": "I noticed that the error code in the `15-dev` branch is not in sync with a freshly generated one (#7963) or in master. Specifically some invariants in `src/isomorphic/hooks` are missing. This is probably caused by [this change](https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/0f004efce2dcd0189a663f5724853eab261782e6#diff-b9e12334e9eafd8341a6107dd98510c9R237) while we were splitting the packages.\n\nIn this PR I copied the `codes.json` file from the `15-dev` branch and fixed the gulp script. ~~and regenerated error codes. For now, we only regenerate error codes when we cut a release and the master one doesn't get updated; It might be better if we sync the `codes.json` file back to master after each release, otherwise it'd be hard to modify an existing error message (like #7963).~~ \n\nEdited: please see a better process at https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7999#issuecomment-255662315.\n\nReviewers: \n@sebmarkbage @gaearon and cc @zpao \n\nTest Plan: \n- run `npm run build` with the latest `codes.json` and there should be no warnings\n",
