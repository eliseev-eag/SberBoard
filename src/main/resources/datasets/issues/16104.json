  "body": "Currently, if a `React.lazy(...)` component fails to load, React reports the error with a component stack in which the lazy component is represented as `Unknown` ([example](https://codesandbox.io/s/unresolved-lazy-component-stack-qjsb3)).\r\n\r\nWith this PR:\r\n1. The default name reported will instead be `Lazy(Unknown)`.\r\n2. We additionally support setting the `displayName` property on the return value of `lazy()`, in which case the name will be `Lazy(${displayName})`.\r\n\r\nNote that both of these changes only apply while the lazy component is unresolved. This PR also adds a test covering the (unchanged) case of a resolved lazy component that throws an error during rendering.\r\n\r\nThe `displayName` support may be leveraged in a Babel plugin (see https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10201) to infer the name from context and make this seamless for most users:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n const Foo = React.lazy(() => import('./FooImplementation'));\r\n+Foo.displayName = 'Foo';\r\n```",
