Yet this argument ***is*** used by third-party libraries, relied upon by React users.\r\n\r\nSo these users will wind up seeing this warning and not really have any power to do anything about it (for instance, [here](https://github.com/dai-shi/react-hooks-global-state/issues/5)).\r\n\r\nIf the intention is that `unstable_observedBits` should ***not*** be used by library authors, I'd appreciate some clear communication on what the alternative API will be.\r\n\r\n`unstable_observedBits` now has moderate adoption among third party libraries for the `Context.Consumer` variant and my expectation would be that a parallel API is supported for `useContext`, at least to the minimal extent that downstream users aren't receiving non-actionable error messages.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16.8+.",
