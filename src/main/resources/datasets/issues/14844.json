  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nAs you mentioned already on docs, at the moment we can not rewrite our exiting components to support hooks ([Hooks could reduce your bundle size](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889)), so what if we want to update react to latest version (for bug fixes, ...), but don't want to add that [1.5KB](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889) to our bundle size?\r\n\r\nThanks",
