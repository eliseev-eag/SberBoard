  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\na bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen React is compiled by Closure Compiler with advanced optimizations, names of injected event plugins are being mungled.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\nCompile React with Closure Compiler directly from NPM.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe names of injected event plugins should not be mungled.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact v15.5.4\r\nIt didn't work in previous versions of React\r\n\r\nClosure Compiler renames object properties, unless they are strings explicitly.\r\nIt happens because of the way how event plugins are injected [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/b1b4a2fb252f26fe10d29ba60d85ff89a85ff3ec/src/renderers/dom/shared/ReactDOMInjection.js#L56-L60)\r\n```js\r\n  EventPluginHub.injection.injectEventPluginsByName({\r\n    SimpleEventPlugin: SimpleEventPlugin,\r\n    EnterLeaveEventPlugin: EnterLeaveEventPlugin,\r\n    ChangeEventPlugin: ChangeEventPlugin,\r\n    SelectEventPlugin: SelectEventPlugin,\r\n    BeforeInputEventPlugin: BeforeInputEventPlugin,\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd later used [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/b1b4a2fb252f26fe10d29ba60d85ff89a85ff3ec/src/renderers/shared/shared/event/EventPluginRegistry.js#L45)\r\n```js\r\n  for (var pluginName in namesToPlugins) {\r\n    var pluginModule = namesToPlugins[pluginName];\r\n    var pluginIndex = eventPluginOrder.indexOf(pluginName);\r\n```",
