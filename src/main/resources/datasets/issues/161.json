  "body": "(Context: my pull request for fixing the bootstrap modal example: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/160).\n[Animation](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/reactjs/RVAY_eQmdpo) in `componentDidMount` works, but doesn't in `componentWillUnmount` for obvious reason.\n\nLet's say I have three divs side by side. When the middle one closes, it does a shrinking animation and disappears, and the one on the right moves left to take its place. Currently it takes a bit of circumventing to make this work (and kills the nice structure and semantic react's aiming for), and at the end it kind of defeats the purpose of the diff rendering technique.\n\nI was wondering if there'd be a clean way, maybe even a new api, to make this work well.\n",
