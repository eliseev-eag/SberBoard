  "body": "This is mostly a security question,\r\n\r\nHow does React store all it's javascript variables/state? Is there any way from the window object, to access a variable defined inside react?\r\n\r\nLets say you are also using redux, and you store some sensitive data on a variable of the state, is there any way an attacker that's able to perform a successful XSS attack, could do something like `alert(window.__react_state.store.myVariable)` ?\r\n",
