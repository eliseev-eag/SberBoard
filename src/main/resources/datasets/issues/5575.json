  "body": "I have something similar to this to handle sliding up-down content (kind of accordion like behaviour). \n\n``` jsx\n<ReactCSSTransitionGroup \n  transitionName=\"slide\"\n  transitionEnterTimeout={ TRANSITION_TIMEOUT }\n  transitionLeaveTimeout={ TRANSITION_TIMEOUT }\n  component=\"div\">\n  { expanded && children }\n</ReactCSSTransitionGroup>\n```\n\nIt works fine, when there was no content and `children` are being mounted. The problem occurs when there were some nodes than need to be hidden and replaced by `false` value. In that case it seems that onEnter animation is fired for empty node before executing onLeave animation for previous `children` node making leaving animation delayed by the time of enter animation for empty node. This shouldn't be happening, I think. Empty node shouldn't be animated when entering DOM or onEnter and onLeave animation should be triggered simultaneously. \n\nI'm using `react-addons-css-transition-group` in version 0.14.3.\n",
