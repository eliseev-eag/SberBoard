  "body": "I've impemented the React numeric-input into my code, however I've noticed that when entering a figure such as '0.05', it doesn't allow it. '0.15' for example works fine, but the '0.0' is the issue.\r\n\r\nIt can be replicated at this link: http://vlad-ignatov.github.io/react-numeric-input/\r\n\r\nIn particular with the 'With inline styles disabled' format. I raised this elsewhere but was told to come here to raise it too. Thanks.",
