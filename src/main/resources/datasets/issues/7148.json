  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nNew feature\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\n`ReactTestRenderer` returns an \"instance\", but this primarily seems to support two things: getting a representation of the \"rendered\" output and calling methods on the instance (via `instance.getInstance().componentMethod()`).\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nThis is good for testing regular UI components, but testing infra-level components (HOCs) often requires testing lifecycle hooks. I've found that I need the ability to re-render the component with new props (test `componentWillReceiveProps`, `shouldComponentUpdate`, etc) and unmount the component altogether (test `componentWillUnmount`).\n\nChanging props can be accomplished via a helper (I'm using the following to work around this issue):\n\n``` javascript\nclass PropsSetter extends React.Component {\n    constructor() {\n      super();\n      this.state = {\n        active: true,\n        props: null,\n      };\n    }\n    setProps(props) {\n      this.setState({props});\n    }\n    unmount() {\n      this.setState({active: false});\n    }\n    render() {\n      if (!this.state.active) {\n         return <div />;\n      }\n      const child = React.Children.only(this.props.children);\n      if (this.state.props) {\n        return React.cloneElement(child, this.state.props);\n      }\n      return child;\n    }\n  }\n\nconst inst = ReactTestRenderer.create(\n  <PropsSetter>\n    <ComponentToTest ... />\n  </PropsSetter>\n);\ninst.getInstance().setProps({...});\n```\n\nThis works for updating props, but calling `PropsSetter#unmount()` fails with `ReactComponentEnvironment.replaceNodeWithMarkup is not a function` (appears that replacing the component with the dummy `<div />` is failing).\n\nPreferably the API would support both of these directly:\n\n``` javascript\nconst inst = ReactTestRenderer.create(<ComponentToTest ... />);\ninst.render(props); // updates with new props\ninst.ummount(); // unmounts component\n```\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\nThis is a new API only on master (to my knowledge).\n",
