  "body": "Obviously the way React Aysnc must work is it is manually keeping tabs on when suspenders resolve as part of its normal flow, but this prevents a false positive where the promise has resolved, but the record hasn't been updated. I understand this likely is handled automatically by any additional ticks fiber adds to the flow--I was learning about *Suspense* from the code and just thought I'd point this out in case it was a mistake.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of what I'm talking about:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst prom = Promise.resolve()\r\n\r\nprom.then(() => console.log(1)).then(() => console.log(2))\r\nprom.then(() => console.log(3))\r\n\r\n1\r\n3 // React thinks suspender has resolved\r\n2 // but the record is set here\r\n\r\n// an additional cycle through the work queue is now required\r\n// to discover the record's resolution\r\n```",
