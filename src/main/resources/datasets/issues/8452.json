  "body": "From the docs:\r\n\r\n> componentDidUpdate() is invoked immediately after updating occurs. This method is not called for the initial render. **Use this as an opportunity to operate on the DOM** when the component has been updated. \r\n\r\nPlease, correct me if I'm wrong. When the the last component in a large sequence of nested component changes, then all cDU from last child to parent are called in sequence. After the last cDU is called, then flushBatchedUpdates is run which, in turn, calls runBatchedUpdates.\r\n\r\nRead this comment from @sebmarkbage  for more context:\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/2659#issuecomment-66165159\r\n\r\nIf this is correct, the docs should say something like: **Use this as an opportunity to enqueue DOM operations in the next execution thread.**\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: I guess this  issue is also related to new hooks proposal: componentWasMounted and componentWasUpdated ( https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7678).\r\nIn the meanwhile, it would be great if the docs specified that componentDid/Mount/Update should use requestAnimationFrame/setTimeout to access the rendered DOM.",
