  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThese two fixtures are both broken due to a reference to `global` in the bundle they reference.\r\n\r\nThis was introduced in a PR I just landed, so I'm fixing it. See https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12900\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nOpen either fixture in Firefox, note the error in the console and the page doesn't update.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThey should have React and/or the schedule module running JS on the page.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nJust on master.\r\n",
