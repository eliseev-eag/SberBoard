  "body": "Currently when a developer is using a text editor Prettier plugin such as [prettier-vscode](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode) or [prettier-atom](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-atom), the formatting functionality will format the files with incorrect settings (such as double quotes and no trailing commas). This is easily fixed by moving a lot of the logic in `scripts/prettier/index.js` upstream to Prettier via a configuration (`.prettierrc.js`) file.\r\n\r\nI've used `scripts/shared/pathsByLanguageVersion` to maintain the addition of the `trailingComma: \"all\"` setting for ESNext files.\r\n\r\nAll four \"modes\" (`check`, `check-changed`, `write`, `write-changed`) have been maintained. \r\n\r\nI have tested this by enabling format-on-save in prettier-vscode and saving both ES5 and ESNext files to check if the correct settings are applied. I have also tested the `check-changed` and `write-changed` files apply the correct rules to the two different types of files.",
