  "body": "When wrapping an item in a `ReactCSSTransitionGroup` and not giving it a `key`, upon adding/removing the item, nothing happens. The item is removed normally but no warning about a missing key is output, which is a bit confusing. Could we have a warning here, if a key is missing?\n\nEdit:\nJust to clarify: The item is removed, but no transition is performed due to classes not being added\n",
