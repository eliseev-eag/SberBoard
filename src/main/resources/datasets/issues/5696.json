  "body": "What are the consequences when a client render is out of sync with a server render? For example, I have a button which I want users with JavaScript disabled to be able to access, but I don't want it when the React client app takes over. Or I would like to minimize file size by using `renderToStaticMarkup` instead of `renderToString`.\n\nSo my two questions can basically be summarized as, what are the performance and other consequences of:\n- Rendering a slightly different dom tree on the server.\n- Mounting on a non-empty dom which does not have `data-react-id`s.\n",
