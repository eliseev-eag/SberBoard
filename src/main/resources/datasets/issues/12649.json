Based on the [docs](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/08/dom-attributes-in-react-16.html) and looking through the code [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/280acbcb713fe0751c6230b94efb45376eb4af67/packages/react-dom/src/shared/DOMProperty.js#L133) it wasn't 100% clear to me whether this was intentional or a bug. \r\n\r\nI came across this because we're currently server rendering some pages which have `amp` attributes on them.  In React 15.x we were using `injectDOMPropertyConfig` to make this work, so I expected that deleting that would just work.  However, since a lot of these attributes don't have an actual value set and are unknown, they're not being passed through. \r\n\r\nHappy to open a PR to either update the docs or fix this if it is actually a bug, but wanted to verify first.\r\n\r\n**Repro**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/71624oy286\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16.x\r\n",
