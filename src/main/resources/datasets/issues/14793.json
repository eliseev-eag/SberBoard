Bug only happens in SSR, and only in dev mode react. Issue appears neither in browser renders, nor in production mode server renders.\r\n\r\nnote: Using https://reactjs.net/ for c# server-side rendering, with bundled-in version of react disabled (so using the same version of react as the client bundle)\r\n\r\n(simplified) application structure\r\n```\r\n// root component\r\nconst {Provider, Consumer} = createContext({});\r\nconst Root = props => return <Provider value={props.notNull}>{props.children}</Provider>;\r\n\r\n// consumer\r\nclass ConsumingComponent extends Component {\r\n  static contextType = Consumer;\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    if (this.context.someValue) return null;\r\n    return <div/>;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// render tree\r\n<Root>...<ConsumingComponent/>...</Root>\r\n\r\n// output of server render\r\nJsRuntimeException: TypeError: unable to get property 'someValue' of undefined or null reference.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n`this.context` in the consuming component should be the value passed to the Provider, and not `undefined`.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThe bug, as best as I can pin down, appeared in 16.6.3. The code works in 16.6..1, and 16.6.2 is listed as a broken release in the changelog.\r\n",
