Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/436/\r\n\r\nIf you open console, and click the `refresh` button, sometimes you may see the state in callback is smaller than it was before the `setState` was called. We definitely expect it would be bigger than it was.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nAs said above.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.3.2",
