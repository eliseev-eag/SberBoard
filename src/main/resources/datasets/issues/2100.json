  "body": "This is a convoluted (but hopefully good enough) example: http://jsfiddle.net/deadlyicon/js16uaxp/2/\n\nWhen the root node returned from a render function changes the value of `this.getDOMNode()` is going to change. This breaks binding and unbinding via `componentWillUnmount` and `componentDidMount` \n\nWhenever the value of  `this.getDOMNode()` is going to change it would be nice if  `componentWillUnmount` was fired before the change and `componentDidMount` was fired again after the change. Essentially a re-mounting. \n",
