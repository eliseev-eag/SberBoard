  "body": "useContext hook have a problem. If you for example create a context like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport React, { createContext, useState } from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport const DummyContext = createContext();\r\n\r\nexport const DummyProvider = (props) => {\r\n    const [state1, setState1] = useState('');\r\n    const [state2, setState2] = useState('');\r\n    const [state3, setState3] = useState('');\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <DummyContext.Provider\r\n            value={[\r\n                [state1, setState1],\r\n                [state2, setState2],\r\n                [state3, setState3]\r\n            ]}\r\n        >\r\n            {props.children}\r\n        </DummyContext.Provider\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's say I have also wrote something like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <DummyProvider>\r\n      <SomeComponent/>\r\n    </DummyProvider>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I want to use that context inside SomeComponent, I will have to call those states and handlers in the exact order I have wrote inside DummyContext, because it seems React is looking for states and handlers by their index, instead of the name. If I don't use those states and handlers in the exact order, values will get mixed.\r\n\r\nOther issue with that is that I can't call only handler for that state, but I also have to include that state even tho I might not use that state inside that component, but only that state handler. If I only include handler, it will give me error like 'handler is not a function', if we say that handler is the name of the actual handler.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be better if it looks for those states by their name (since there can't be duplicate states in the context), so I would be able to include only those states I want from the context? Less code and it would be easier to maintain that code.",
