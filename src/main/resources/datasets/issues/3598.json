  "body": "Hi,\nI'm trying to run the jasmine tests in firefox and 678 of 817 fail.\nBut when I run the tests in Chrome, they succeed.\n\nI know your tests run on Phantom JS which is a headless Chrome, but aren't the tests supposed to run on all browsers ?\n\napart from all the \"assertion failed\" I was able to spot this : \n\n```\nExpected '<span data-react-checksum=\"-140697198\" data-reactid=\".2\"><span data-reactid=\".2.0\">Name: </span><span data-reactid=\".2.1\">x</span></span>' to be '<span data-reactid=\".2\" data-react-checksum=\"-140697198\"><span data-reactid=\".2.0\">Name: </span><span data-reactid=\".2.1\">x</span></span>'.\n```\n\nand it seems the only thing that changed is the order of the \"data\" attributes in the first tag. Are the tests dependent on this ?\n",
