  "body": "Try to support `Suspense` in shallow renderer, which may partially solve #14170 . Also in airbnb/enzyme#1975 I'm trying to add support of Suspense and Lazy but stuck with that shallow renderer not support it.\r\n\r\nI know this is arguable - or even not make sense - to shallow render Suspense. But, in some of use cases people would be like to know what's rendering in one layer down of `Suspense` (like [wrapper.dive](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/ShallowWrapper/dive.html)), so I think it's still valuable.\r\n\r\nCurrently in the PR I haven't handled the `fallback` and `lazy`, just plainly return children under Suspense. I'm not sure if it's good to handle fallback - find all the lazy component under Suspense and render it and wait for thenable resolve to update, which is complicated in fiber implementaion - in shallow rendering. I think it would be great for testing to have a simpler implementation, but not sure if there is other consideration here.",
