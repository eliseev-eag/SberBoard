  "body": "The current behavior is that none of my index.js is being rendered. When I use the react-scripts to build the web application in 16.2.0, I get an r.PropTypes is undefined error when I visit the localhost address. I presume this is because PropTypes is deprecated in 15.5 onwards and removed in 16, but I can't for the life of me figure out what is calling this. It's in some weird part of main.########.js after create-react-app builds it. I've tried updating all my other dependencies, but no dice once I update to React 16. The application works fine in 15.6.2.\r\n\r\nI'm using NPM and here is my package.json: \r\n\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"node-wf\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\r\n  \"private\": true,\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"create-react-app\": \"^1.5.2\",\r\n    \"halogen\": \"^0.2.0\",\r\n    \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.1\",\r\n    \"react\": \"^16.3.0\",\r\n    \"react-bootstrap\": \"^0.32.1\",\r\n    \"react-bootstrap-toggle\": \"^2.3.1\",\r\n    \"react-contenteditable\": \"^2.0.7\",\r\n    \"react-dom\": \"^16.3.0\",\r\n    \"react-split-pane\": \"^0.1.77\",\r\n    \"react-textarea-autosize\": \"^6.1.0\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"react-scripts\": \"^1.1.4\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\r\n    \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\r\n    \"test\": \"react-scripts test --env=jsdom\",\r\n    \"eject\": \"react-scripts eject\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"proxy\": \"http://localhost:3001/\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm also using some CDN scripts for jQuery, Bootstrap 3.3.7, Bootstrap toggle, and plotly. I'm not sure if there is a compatibility issue with those?",
