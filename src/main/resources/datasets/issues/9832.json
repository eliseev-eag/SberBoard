  "body": "Currently if the `__source` transform is enabled together with the production build there are no indicators of a poorly performant configuration. https://facebook.github.io/react/ even has it.\r\n\r\nWe already check for the [existence of a `__source` field](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/isomorphic/classic/element/ReactElement.js#L203). So we can just reuse the same check to issue something in prod mode if it exists.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that we don't have any warning module in prod and it is unclear if it would get attention or even considered to spammy in prod.\r\n\r\nWe could throw but that might be too extreme since a misconfiguration would kill the site.\r\n\r\nWe could also use this to set a flag on the `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__` object. The icon in the devtools extension could use this to indicate a misconfigured build.",
