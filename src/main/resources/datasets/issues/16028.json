  "body": "Proposal:\r\n\r\nThe most top level component, like an `App.js` can create a global state store like Redux that all child components can access with a method like: `setGlobalState()`.\r\nNot with props or callback functions passed into props.\r\n\r\nRedux is a bit complex to achieve a task of global state across components and is hard for people to learn and understand. At the high level of React development, most people are using Redux. It would be cool if we could include the functionality of Redux natively into React with a simpler set of methods.\r\n\r\nMy Idea:\r\n\r\n``` \r\nconstructor(props){\r\n   this.state = {\r\n       // normal local component state as already implemented\r\n   }\r\n   this.globalState = {\r\n      // only 1 instance of globalState can be declared in application, preferably in the most top- \r\n      level component.\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.setState() // uses local component state, as already implemented\r\n.setGlobalState() // uses most top level component state, ex. `App.js`\r\nthis.state.foobar // normal access of state\r\nthis.globalState.foobar // global level access \r\n```\r\n\r\nRoast me if this won't work or it's a bad idea, but I'd be interested in seeing if this could be done and would be of valuable to the project.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
