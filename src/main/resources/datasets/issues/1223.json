  "body": "React fixes inconsistencies in the DOM and avoids being held back by older browsers (to the extent possible). The only reason that the DOM authors chose `className` and `htmlFor` was because the JS engines of the time didn't support using `class` and `for` as unquoted property names.\n\nChanging React to use `class` and `for` agrees with our principles of improving the DOM and using modern JS, and is what most people expect when first starting with React.\n",
