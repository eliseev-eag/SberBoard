  "body": " With the goal to better understand react reconciliation I created this example\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Just a simple timer component basically which shows each second passed\r\nclass Stateful extends React.Component{\r\n constructor(props){\r\n   super(props)\r\n     this.state={timer:0}\r\n   }\r\n    \r\n  componentDidMount(){\r\n    let that = this;\r\n    setInterval(function(){\r\n    that.setState(function(prevState){return {timer: prevState.timer+1}})\r\n    }, 1000);\r\n  }\r\n  render(){\r\n    return <p>{this.state.timer}</p>\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Just a demo class for understanding reconciliation\r\nclass Demo extends React.Component {\r\n   constructor(props){\r\n     super(props)\r\n     this.state={}\r\n   }\r\n  componentDidMount(){\r\n    let that = this;\r\n    setTimeout(function(){\r\n    that.setState({showWarning: true})\r\n  }, 3000);\r\n  }\r\n  render() {\r\n    if (this.state.showWarning) {\r\n      return (\r\n        <div>\r\n          <Stateful /> // I was hoping this would create a new instance of Stateful Component after 3 seconds\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <Stateful />\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n}\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(\r\n  <Demo />,\r\n  document.getElementById('container')\r\n);\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nYou can see after three seconds `showWarning `is set to true. **So I was believing that after three seconds I would get a new instance of `<Stateful>` component (because it lives in a different div than the one rendered already)**  - hence I would see the output of `Stateful `component starting from 0 again, but the timer just continued to increase on the screen....  So the output basically is:\r\n0...1...2...3...4....(and so on each second).\r\nWhereas I expected it to show 0...1..2.. and on third second do a restart basically and start 0...1...2...3...etc.\r\nWhat did I miss from reconciliation docs that led me believe in this? (I have a feeling the react docs on this misses to highlight this, or it might be I missed something?)",
