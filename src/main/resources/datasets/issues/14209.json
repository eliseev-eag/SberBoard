Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.

Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nYes. In the codepen listed, I've included 16.6.1 dependencies, which have the umd output. 16.6.2 patch removed it, which you can reproduce if you change the unpkg.com urls.",
