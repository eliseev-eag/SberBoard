Everything else we were considering wasn't a regression so it got booted and we can catch up later.\n## Real Code Changes\n- [x] remaining regression with simulating events (#6380)\n- [x] fix failing test / fallout from #6228 (#6426)\n- [x] upgrade deps (#6413)\n## Docs\n- [x] update properties & attributes\n- [ ] Removed deprecated methods\n- [ ] Add any new deprecation notes\n- [x] Add notes for potentially confusing version mismatches (eg, returning null from a functional component)\n## Actual Release\n- [x] create branch (`15-stable`)\n- [x] shrinkwrap\n- [x] update changelog (sync with blog post)\n- [x] publish\n- [x] Update travis to build docs from new branch (part of release but after everything is published)\n## Post-release\n- [x] update the tutorial repo\n- [x] update fiddles\n- [x] ensure master has release resource synced\n",
