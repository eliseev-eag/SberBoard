  "body": "When dealing with touch events, browsers \"simulate\" mouse events from them. This can be problematic for the experimental event API, as it means that when we've dispatched a \"Press\" during the \"pointerup\" event, a later \"mouseup\" or \"click\" event can cause side-effects that would never have happened by using \"click\" (as it's the last event). I've allowed \"click\" for now, only so that this doesn't affect tracking tooling that relies upon \"click\" working for touch events too; so only \"mousedown\" and \"mouseup\" and blocked when using Press.",
