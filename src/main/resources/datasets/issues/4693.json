Please use `require(\"react-dom\").render` instead.\n```\n\nSo naive as I am, I just put this in my console:\n\n```\nnpm install react-dom\n```\n\nWhich got me this: https://github.com/EtienneLem/react-dom\nThis has mayor issues with webpack as mentioned here: https://github.com/EtienneLem/react-dom/issues/1\n\nSo, the answer is: Wrong repository..\n\nWhere do I get the correct react-dom module?\n",
