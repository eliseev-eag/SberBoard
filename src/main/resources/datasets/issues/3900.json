  "body": "You can now write almost anything in JSX that you can write in JavaScript...except for this case, as far as I can tell. Instead of having to write:\n\n```\nReact.createElement(someDynamicElement, props, children)\n```\n\nI think it would be neat to be able to write:\n\n```\n <{someDynamicElement} {...props}>\n   {children}\n </{someDynamicElement}>\n```\n\nIt's not a huge deal, but it would plug the last leak in JSX syntax, allowing people to not have to do a context switch and think about the underlying transform in order to figure out how to do something like this.\n",
