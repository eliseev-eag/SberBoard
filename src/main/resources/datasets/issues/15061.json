We need to get actual content on the screen soon.\r\n\r\nIf we deprioritize that work to offscreen, then the timeout heuristics will be wrong.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if we have no current and we're already at terminal fallback state we'll immediately schedule a deletion and upgrade to real suspense.\r\n\r\nIdeally, if we're in a pending state, we should also just register the listener instead of retrying at offscreen, but meh.\r\n\r\nThe first commit is from another branch I needed to factor out but might as well include it here.",
