  "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI find myself wanting this feature a lot. I will name some const `something` and then find myself having to pass it in like so:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n<SomeComponent something={something} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would love to be able to use the es6 shorthand notation for object creation that assumes `{object: object}` if it's just passed in as `{object}`. So in a component it would work like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n<SomeComponent {something}/> // === <SomeComponent something={something} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else find this a worthwhile change?",
