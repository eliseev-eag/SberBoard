The article itself does provide a good deal of informative information as to why two-way bindings are useful and how React itself works, but it focuses heavily on the now-deprecated `LinkedStateMixin ` feature. \r\n\r\nI'm requesting this here because this page is the top result on Google (UK) when searching for \"react two-way binding\" (without quotes).\r\n",
