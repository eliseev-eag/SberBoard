When the Component is clicked the Event does not receive the React Component (specified callback is not invoked)\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\r\n\r\nYou can reproduce it with Web Component example contained in the react repository (https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/examples/webcomponents/index.html): Replace the 'a' element with a button and add for example an onClick event handler. \r\n\r\nYou can find a modified version of the Web Component example (based on the 15.4.2 codebase - https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/v15.4.2/examples/webcomponents/index.html) here:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/nilshartmann/3a520920e5fc920bfde49e077ad3beab#file-index-html-L50 \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe event handler should be called.\r\n\r\nFor testing I have modified `getEventTarget.js` to return the target from the `path` property of the `nativeEvent` (instead of the \"original\" `target` from the `nativeEvent`). With this addition it works - \r\nthe Event Handler is called.\r\n\r\nYou can find the modified version also in the gist: https://gist.github.com/nilshartmann/3a520920e5fc920bfde49e077ad3beab#file-geteventtarget-js-L6\r\n\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n15.4.x and 16.x\r\nI've tested in Chrome, Firefox and Safari. I don't know if it works in previous versions of React (don't think so)",
