  "body": "One of the things holding us back right now is that we don't have a stable public API. I'd really like to cut Instagram over to the npm version of React but unfortunately it doesn't include some of the addons that we need because of this issue. I'd like to propose the following changes:\n## Consistent, iterable `this.props.children`\n\n`this.props.children` gets wrapped in a new `ReactChildIterator` object -- basically a thin wrapper around `ReactChildren.map()`. This means that people can actually introspect `this.props.children` without assuming it's an array or a nested object or something.\n\nI don't think memory utilization is a big problem today so I think this change would be OK, especially if it is implemented lazily. I know that @dnolen wants something like this too if he can plug in his own lazy child data structure.\n\nI do think it's important we solve this. Another option I was thinking of was putting `mapChildren()` on `ReactCompositeComponent` -- but that begs the question of adding `onlyChild()` as well and I think the API would become confusing.\n## `cloneWithProps()` on `ReactComponent`\n\nI think this function is very helpful and hard to use externally right now. Adding it to the public API of `ReactComponent` makes sense to me. Does anyone think that there is potential for overuse here?\n## Public `injection` APIs\n\nI think we should centralize all injection points for React in a `ReactInjection` module and make it public as `React.injection`. There's no reason why you should need to check out the repo to configure a custom React.\n## Rename `lib/` to `internal/` in the `react` npm module\n\nFor many addons we'll need to do stuff like `require('react/lib/ReactUpdates')` for the foreseeable future. Let's just embrace it for now and rename `lib/` to `internal_do_not_use_or_you_will_be_fired/` so non-core projects don't depend on this.\n## Put each add-on into its own npm module\n\nEverything in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/745/files\n## Add new `react-svg` npm package\n\nThis will export the `DOMPropertyConfig` which can be injected with the new public `ReactInjection` APIs.\n## Use `wzrd.in` for package builds\n\nWe can put our own cache in front of it so we are good citizens. This way people can build their own `react-whatever.min.js` without us having to provide a million builds or a config tool.\n",
