  "body": "In the case a `null` argument is passed to a property marked as `isRequired`:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/jeanlauliac/0n6snb6b/1/\n\nWe'll get a proper warning in the console: `Warning: Required prop `name` was not specified in `Hello`.` (though it should probably be \"prop was null\" and not \"prop was not specified\", but anyway)\n\nOn the other hand, the default value is only used when the prop is `undefined`, but not when it's `null`. Is this the explicitly wanted behavior? If it is, then we should probably make the documentation explicit about it (http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html), giving the entire responsibility to component callers of safeguarding against `null`.\n",
