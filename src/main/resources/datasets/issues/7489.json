Type any five character text\n3. Caret should be at position `2` (i.e. `12|345`) because it is forced there after every change with `setSelectionRange`\n4. Use arrow or mouse to move caret to position `5` (i.e. `12345|`).\n5. Press backspace\n6. Caret goes to position `4` (i.e. `1234|`)\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n\nCaret should obey `setSelectionRange` and go to position `2` even after backspace on IE10.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\nThis bug started at React v15.0.0. React v14.8 did not have this problem.\n\nThis issue was reported here https://github.com/msafi/text-mask/issues/133. @Heymdall found out that if you wrap `setSelectionRange` in a `setTimeout(..., 0)`, it sets the position correctly, though the user would have to type slowly to ensure this always happens, so that is not a workaround.\n",
