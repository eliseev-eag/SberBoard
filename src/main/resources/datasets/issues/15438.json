  "body": "Well, I want to add a value to the props of react's every component. The content of the key is the name of the component.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to do that?\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass App extends React.Component {\r\n  render () {\r\n    console.log(this.props.path) //App\r\n    return <Child />\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Child extends React.Component {\r\n  render () {\r\n    console.log(this.props.path) //App/Child\r\n    return 'hello world'\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nUnfortunately, almost all of the responses I received were from HOC and Contentext.\r\n\r\nBut what I mean is, how to batch all components to modify props\r\n\r\n\r\nThese components should not be wrapped by HOC or Consumer, because too many, nesting can be terrible.\r\n\r\nAn API like `React. Components. map` should be needed to do this.\r\n",
