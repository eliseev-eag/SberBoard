However, it seems that the release process includes two scripts rather than being a script on its own.\r\n- Officially, and also confirmed on the [homepage readme](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/README.md#installation), the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) logo and name are with lowercase letters.\r\n- Some abbreviations were missing punctuation.\r\n",
