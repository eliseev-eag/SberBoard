  "body": "Hello, react.js is a fast moving project with many contributors. Would you perhaps want to have a common commit message style? Some projects, like [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commits/master) and [Angular.js](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commits/master), have a consistent commit history by using a style.\n\nThis PR introduces a new `devDependency` module called `commitplease`. Once you `npm install`, any  `git commit` automatically checks that the message that you enter follows a certain style (jQuery style by default). Here is a general idea of how it looks:\n![record](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/962850/17098312/cc28284a-5272-11e6-907d-e929d7259385.gif)\n\nWe could discuss details if you really would like that and/or which style guide you would prefer.\n",
