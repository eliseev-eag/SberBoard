  "body": "We're missing the .circle.yml config on our 15-stable branch. It would be great to copy it over and whatever other files need to be copied to make CI pass. Anyone should be able to test by sending a PR to 15-stable (unlike normal PRs which go to master) with the changes and seeing if Circle will pass. It might be as simple as just copying .circle.yml and scripts/circleci.",
