  "body": "Fresh Runtime used to assume there's only one renderer injected at a time. That assumption is inaccurate. For example, on DOM+ART or Paper+Fabric surfaces it resulted in the \"wrong\" roots being passed to a renderer.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to store the renderer helpers per renderer ID, and associate mounted roots with them. Then we know which one to use.\r\n\r\nI verified this fixes an issue we found in the Fabric experiment.",
