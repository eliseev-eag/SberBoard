  "body": "Maybe we don't care, but some attributes are currently only set if SSR is used.\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/8ftyu8eq/\n\nNot sure if it's worse than the old behavior (which was different for initial render as compared to subsequent renders).  But this could be a tricky one for people to debug if they hit it, since it depends on a more subtle difference (SSR vs CSR); I imagine people frequently fail to test their components on SSR, so the difference is more likely to catch them by surprise.\n",
