  "body": "Adds a feature flag `enableNewScheduler` that toggles between two implementations of ReactFiberScheduler. This will let us land changes in master while preserving the ability to quickly rollback.\r\n\r\nIdeally this will be a short-lived fork. Once we've tested the new scheduler for a week or so without issues, we will get rid of it. Until then, we'll need to maintain two parallel implementations and run tests against both of them. We rarely land changes to ReactFiberScheduler, so I don't expect this will be a huge burden.\r\n\r\nThis commit does not implement anything new. The flag is still off and tests run against the existing implementation.\r\n\r\nUse `yarn test-new-scheduler` to run tests against the new one.",
