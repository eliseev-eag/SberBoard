  "body": "Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but are there any examples of using React to render a visualization created in D3.js?\n\nIt seems like React's Virtual DOM could really speed up animations and transitions used in visualizations like the [Force Directed Graph](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045). D3.js just draws SVG, so as long as React can manipulate SVG like DOM it should work, right? I'm still a React newb, so just looking for any suggestions to get me started.\n",
