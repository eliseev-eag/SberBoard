  "body": "Using IE 11 if one has an `input` component with a `placeholder` attribute and an `onChange` handler, the onChange handler will be called when clicking the input without typing anything in, just clicking it.\n\nI made a reproducible case in codepen here: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/BoGQyZ If one opens it in IE and look in the console and clicks the input with the placeholder they should see an event from the `onChange` handler.\n\nIt seems to be [a known issue](https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/details/810538/ie-11-fires-input-event-on-focus) that Microsoft is unwilling to fix. However if one of React's goals is to normalize the onChange event as the documentation implies this needs a workaround. One possible solution would be to check if the input that triggered an `input` event is focused at the moment.\n",
