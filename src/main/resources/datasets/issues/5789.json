  "body": "We bail out of rerender when the props object is triple-equals-equal.  It can lead to some unintuitive results, where the user has dropped all references to a string, and yet the old data is still visible after a render/forceUpdate.\n\nExample: https://jsfiddle.net/rah1ptut/\n\nInvoking `ReactDOM.render()` again is insufficient.  You need to call `ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode` and then `ReactDOM.render` again.  This seems like an API violation.\n\nDo we already have an issue tracking this?  Would we fix it?  @sebmarkbage @spicyj @zpao \n",
