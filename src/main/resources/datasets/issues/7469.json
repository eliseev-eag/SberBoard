  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\n\nbug\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\n\nIt says:\n\n> Warning: React attempted to reuse markup in a container but the checksum was invalid. This generally means that you are using server rendering and the markup generated on the server was not what the client was expecting. React injected new markup to compensate which works but you have lost many of the benefits of server rendering. Instead, figure out why the markup being generated is different on the client or server:\n>  (client) <div data-reactroot\n>  (server) <div data-reactroot\n> \n> Server-side React render was discarded. Make sure that your initial render does not contain any client-side code.\n\nAs one can see, the `(client)` and `(server)` parts are equal, so I don't know what is it complaining about.\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n\nThat it would complain about unequal strings\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\nThe latest React 0.15.3\n",
