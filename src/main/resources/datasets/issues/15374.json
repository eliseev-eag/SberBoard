  "body": "This implementation differs from equivalents in React Native in the following ways:\r\n\r\n1. A move during a press will not cancel onLongPress.\r\n2. A move to outside the retention target will cancel all pending events and not reactivate when moved back within the retention target.\r\n\r\nWe can change this in the future but I think we'll want to refactor the state machine first.\r\n\r\nRef #15257",
