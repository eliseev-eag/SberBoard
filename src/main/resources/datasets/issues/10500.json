  "body": "Hey guys, \r\n**First of all... thank you for such a great framework... Just started learning react and it's mindblowing comparing to frameworks like maybe Angular**\r\n\r\nBut, \r\nThis is been raised yesterday => https://medium.com/@raulk/if-youre-a-startup-you-should-not-use-react-reflecting-on-the-bsd-patents-license-b049d4a67dd2\r\n\r\n> “BSD + patents” essentially means that the code is open (for everyone to see and use), but it’s always copyrighted by Facebook. And they grant you a patent license as long as you’re nice to them by never suing Facebook for patent infringement.\r\n> The instant you sue Facebook, your patent rights for React — and any other Facebook ‘open source’ technology you happen to use) — are automatically revoked.\r\n\r\nAs far I can understand... \r\nFor example\r\n- I started a startup, maybe the next facebook (if that makes sense)\r\n- I used React for the coding part for frontend development\r\n- My startup got popular and it became the next competitor to facebook\r\n- Somehow, got a problem with Facebook, Inc which doesnt have anything to do with react or open source for that matter and I sue facebook due to some reasons (which even dont have to do anything with the codes). \r\n- My License for React is **REVOKED** and I can't use React... and I am in trouble!\r\n\r\nand here is one more example (this time from the post)\r\n\r\n> **Why should avoid React if you’re a startup**\r\n> If you’re building a startup, I’m assuming you — and your investors — are hoping to land a million-dollar worth exit at some point, right?\r\n> You want to keep your door open to all acquirers, especially the large ones: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc.\r\n> These companies likely hold patent arsenals against Facebook — and even if they didn’t — they don’t want to surrender their rights to sue Facebook if the time came.\r\n> If your product is built on React, acquiring you means losing these rights, and this is something they are probably not prepared to do.",
