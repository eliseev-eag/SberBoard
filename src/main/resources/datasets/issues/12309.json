  "body": "I was curious earlier if the `onSelect` event works on things other than form elements and `contentEditable` elements, and by disabling a couple of conditions in the code, it seems — at first brush, at least — that `onSelect` works splendidly on any element that is focusable (via the `tabIndex` attribute), to obtain things like:\r\n\r\n![ezgif-2-326cf42421](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/205375/36798178-8aa7fdda-1cb2-11e8-8838-46e04300a09a.gif)\r\n\r\nWould there be any problem with relaxing the conditions for allowing `onSelect` to include elements that have a `tabIndex` attribute? (Other than the case where existing implementations in userland rely on the event being disabled when `contenteditable = true` is removed from an element).",
