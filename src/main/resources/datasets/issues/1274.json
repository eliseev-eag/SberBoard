  "body": "Is there a reason for that? As I understand it shares code with `transferPropsTo` method where `key`-transfer is not needed.\n\nWhen using a `cloneWithProps` I'd expect `key` prop to be transferred but currently:\n\n```\nvar React = require('react/addons');\nvar A = React.createClass({render: function() {}});\n\nvar a1 = A({key: 'key'});\nvar a2 = React.addons.cloneWithProps(a2, {});\n\nvar assert = require('assert'):\nassert.ok(a1.props.key === 'key');\nassert.ok(a2.props.key === undefined);\n```\n",
