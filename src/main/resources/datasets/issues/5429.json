  "body": "Here's my problem. \n\nUsing react-router 1.0, i'm going to be re-rendering trees that are 90% the same. We use an external lib for an api that produces video mark up. Totally out of our hands. They modify the dom and that's how it has to be. \n\nMy problem comes in that when the routing changes, it re-renders the tree, and wipes out the custom DOM put in by the third party api. \n\nI've tried things like returning false from `shouldComponentUpdate` always.. using `dangerouslySetInnerHtml={{__html: ''}}` to a blank string hoping that react would internally not do diff's on it.. nothing seems to work. \n\nIs there anything I can do to stop it?\n",
