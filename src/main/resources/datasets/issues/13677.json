Open the developer console and click \"Run\" to see the output.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nChildren.map, forEach, toArray, count should traverse keyed Fragments as per documentation.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThe example runs on v16.5.1, but I have also seen that fail locally on v16.4.2. I never tried this before so I donâ€™t know if this ever worked. I see it fail in latest Firefox and Chrome on Ubuntu Linux. ",
