  "body": "##### Scenario\n\nI am trying to use React to dynamically replace a `tbody` tag with my app's content. In addition, I need to use a `componentDidMount` callback to handle some custom event binding.\n##### Problem\n\nAs soon as the `componentDidMount` callback is added to `React.createClass`, React throws the following errors:\n\n``` html\nError while invoking `findComponentRoot` with the following ancestor node: <tbody id=​\"content\">​…​</tbody>\n​    \nUncaught Error: Invariant Violation: findComponentRoot(..., .r[3skhu]): Unable to find element. This probably means the DOM was unexpectedly mutated (e.g. by the browser).\n```\n\n[JSFiddle here](http://jsfiddle.net/B4u3j/)\n##### Conclusion\n\nThe content still renders, but the error is a bit unnerving. Simply removing the callback prevents the errors from being thrown.\n\nI'm brand new to this, so its possible that I'm trying to make React do something that it is not meant to handle. But either way, I think the mere existence of an empty callback should not be throwing any errors.\n\nFWIW, other scenarios that involve injecting content rather than replacing an existing DOMNode seem to work fine with or without the `componentDidMount` callback.\n",
