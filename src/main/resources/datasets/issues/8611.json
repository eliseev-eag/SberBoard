  "body": "#### Overview\r\n\r\n`ReactFiberStack` is the new underlying stack construct used by `ReactFiberContext` and `ReactFiberHostContext`. The goal is to simplify the 2 context managers _and_ to add earlier and better dev-warnings when we pop unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nThis change set causes a lot of tests to fail as we are currently popping too many times and/or in the wrong order. I'm pushing this branch now to share with Sebastian as he is working on a related cleanup in `beginWork`.\r\n\r\n#### Work needing to be done for this branch\r\n- [x] Track Fibers with unique host contexts to avoid over-popping; (see [this](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8611#issuecomment-268596186))\r\n- [x] Tighten up the `Fiber | null` type in `ReactFiberStack` by making sure that we always pass a `Fiber` down; currently this is not the case for `pushHostContainer` and `popHostContainer`.\r\n- [x] Verify that no new test failures are caused by this refactor.\r\n",
