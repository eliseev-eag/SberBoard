  "body": "I noticed there were a lot of warnings and a few failures pertaining to slight formatting issues. I thought I'd clear them up as it twinged my OCD :D \r\n\r\nMost warnings were line length problems, I ignored lines that were lengthy because of string values or if they were the definition of a function. For any function calls I just put each parameter on a new line.\r\n\r\nAlso got rid of a FIXME related to eslint that didn't appear to be a problem anymore.\r\n\r\nMight want to consider modifying the eslint rules to ignore string literals and comments to avoid more of these?\r\n",
