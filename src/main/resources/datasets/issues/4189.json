  "body": "I'm ok with React requiring shims. I'd include them whether React needed them or not. However I don't believe React should require es5-sham to work. Because, among other reasons, including shams has the potential to break other libraries on the same page and hence doesn't sound like a good practice for one library to demand.\n\nOf the two shams React says it requires (in the 0.14 code in npm) each one is only used once in the entire codebase.\n\n2 function invocations doesn't sound like a good reason for requiring a 5kb library that has potential side effects.\n\nThe best practice for React would probably be to provide its own small module providing either the native function or an internal sham.\n\nThis would also be a positive. As these internal shams wouldn't have to waste bytes trying to sham functionality that React doesn't need. And they could emit invariant warnings when misused during development instead of failing (potentially silently) the way they would in es5-sham.\n",
