  "body": "This release has been a bit rocky. ðŸ˜› \r\nI'm keeping track of known issues to fix them up together in the next patch.\r\n\r\n- [x] Expose `unstable_batchedUpdates` on shallow renderer (https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9382), needed for Enzyme (https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/pull/876#issuecomment-292747996)\r\n- [x] Create Fragment CommonJS entry point is messed up (https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9383, https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9381)\r\n- [x] CRC package misses dependency on `object-assign`\r\n- [x] Some CommonJS addons inline fbjs unnecessary\r\n- [x] UMD files contain `process` shim\r\n- [x] UMD files aren't envified\r\n- [x] LinkedInput UMD is broken\r\n- [x] Release `linked-input`\r\n- [x] prop-types is missing LICENSE and PATENT file\r\n- [x] Fix and release `create-react-class` (tagging @acdlite for this and add the rest of us)\r\n\r\nRegarding `create-react-class`:\r\n* Add docs link to the main docs. Currently just says \"_Documentation is WIP_\".\r\n* Add peer deps for React 15.5+ (15.5+ because of `replaceState` callback issue). Currently there are no peer deps at all, only dev deps.\r\n* Release update to NPM",
