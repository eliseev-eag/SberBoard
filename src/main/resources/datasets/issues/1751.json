  "body": "This is not a big deal, but in some Browserify cases the React component name is not correctly inferred from the variable name it is assigned, like it is normally the case during JSX transformation.\n\nThis works fine:\n\n```\nvar Footer = React.createClass({\n    ...\n});\nmodule.exports = Footer;\n```\n\nAnd produce error messages like: `Warning: Required prop \"appState\" was not specified in \"Footer\"`. In this error message, the component name `Footer` was correctly inferred.\n\nNow with another kind of node module declaration:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = React.createClass({\n    ...\n});\n```\n\nThis does not work: `Warning: Required prop \"appState\" was not specified in \"exports\"`\n\nThis is quite annoying because it's then not so easy to know in which component we didn't inject the required props, and I guess some other usecases.\n\nIn case the React class is assigned to `module.exports`, I guess the component name should rather be the filename.\n\nDon't know if it's a bug or a feature request, just wanted to mention that\n",
