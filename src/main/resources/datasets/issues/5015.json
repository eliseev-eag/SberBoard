  "body": "For practical reasons about performance and energy conservation (in this sense, all React components are non-idempotent and have side effects), I occasionally will check my state before setting it:\n\n``` js\nif (this.state.something) {\n  this.setState({ ... });\n}\n```\n\nI would like to be able to do this with the transactional version of `setState` as well:\n\n``` js\nthis.setState(state => {\n  if (state.something) {\n    return { ... };\n  }\n  // if null or undefined (or false?) is returned, don't re-render!\n});\n```\n\n---\n\nA toy example of this is a piece of component state that gets updated during each scroll event. Due to event batching (especially with RN), multiple scroll events can fly in during the same batch.\n\n``` js\n<ScrollView onScroll={() => {\n  this.setState(state => {\n    if (state.numberOfScrollEvents < 10) {\n      return { numberOfScrollEvents: state.numberOfScrollEvents + 1 };\n    }\n  });\n} />\n```\n",
