  "body": "Having issues developing on windows (7) on a fresh install (master).\n\nRunning `npm test` causes all 118 test suites to fail with the error:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5804010/19039654/bf3e3736-8978-11e6-9483-babae236e498.png)\n\nChanging `testRegex` in the `package.json from`/**tests**/`to just`**tests**` seems to fix those issues, because the last character is an escape character, it's invalid regex.\n\nThere is another regex error though:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5804010/19039859/873953e2-8979-11e6-84ff-fb93eb7a395c.png)\n\nNot sure where that regex comes from though...\n\nThere is also a 3rd error\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5804010/19040014/1f051e04-897a-11e6-92a5-bd25752ddf3d.png)\n\nwhich just looks like a unix -> git bash crossover issue. Possibly another escape character issue.\n\nDoes anyone run on windows and had similar issues?\n",
