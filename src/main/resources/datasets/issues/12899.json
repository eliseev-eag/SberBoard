  "body": "<!--\r\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\r\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nI believe this is a bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen adding multiple elements inside a Fragment, they get added one at a time.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nI setup a demo app here: https://city41.github.io/fragmenttest/\r\nhttps://github.com/city41/fragmenttest\r\n\r\nSteps to repro:\r\n1. click the \"edit\" button in the first card\r\n2. watch what happens both visually and in the DOM (break on subtree modifications is helpful)\r\n\r\nYou can see the cancel button very briefly has the hover state, and so its background is red. You can also see in the DOM using \"Break on subtree modifications\" on the parent div that the cancel button gets added, then the save button gets added on a second render.\r\n\r\nThe behavior depends on the browser:\r\n\r\n`Chrome (Windows 10, 66.0.3359.181 (Official Build) (64-bit)):` the cancel button briefly has the hover state and appears red.\r\n\r\n`Edge (Windows 10, 42.17134.1.0):` the cancel button gains the hover state and keeps it. It will be red until you move the mouse again\r\n\r\n`Firefox (Windows 10, 60.0.1):` Firefox visually behaves as expected. If I was only using Firefox as my browser I would not have detected this issue.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nAfter clicking the edit button, the save and cancel buttons get added to the DOM at the same time, and so the hover state on the buttons is always properly applied. You can see this by clicking \"edit\" in the second card, which uses a span instead of a fragment.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.3.2. Unsure if this worked in a previous version.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
