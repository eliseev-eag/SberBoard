  "body": "Say I'm building a controlled React `<NumInput />` element that returns `<input type=\"number\" value={this.props.value} />`. What's the proper way to initialize it if I want to start off with a blank value? `0` is not equivalent to `''`, and anything I can think to pass in throws errors.\n\nIs this an anti-pattern? I don't want to just hack a text input because I'd like to take advantage of built-in min / max / step functionality...\n\nPassing `\"\"`: \n\n> Warning: Failed prop type: Invalid prop value of type string supplied to NumInput, expected number.\n\nPassing `null` : \n\n> Warning: value prop on input should not be null. Consider using the empty string to clear the component or undefined for uncontrolled components.\n\nPassing `undefined`: \n\n> Warning: NumInput is changing an uncontrolled input of type number to be controlled. Input elements should not switch from uncontrolled to controlled (or vice versa). Decide between using a controlled or uncontrolled input element for the lifetime of the component.\n",
