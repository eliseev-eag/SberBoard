  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nThis is a bug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIf you extend from PureComponent, and the context of the component changes but not the props, a re-render will not be triggered.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\r\n\r\nYou can see the bug reproduced here: \r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/fcz8tx3z/16/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nYou expect that if you click on the increment context button, you would see it updated in the view, but that doens't happen. If you change props, you'll see context instantly update to it's actual value in the view.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n \r\nReact 15.3.2\r\nChrome 54\r\n\r\nFixing this should be reasonably simple I think. Just need to add shallow comparing for context. I have my own stand in for PureComponent in the meantime: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass Purified extends Component {\r\n    shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState, nextContext) {\r\n      return !(shallowEquals(this.props, nextProps) && shallowEquals(this.context, nextContext));\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```",
