  "body": "I am using React ver 15.6.x and  have created my React JS components using ES6 style class patterns and I am not using 'React.createClass' anywhere in my app.  Still on my client side node server, I am getting deprecation warning like shown as below screen-shot : \r\n<img width=\"1410\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-05-15 at 18 24 44\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16350637/40057941-4dcb404c-586d-11e8-91a4-f2e8a3689051.png\">\r\n\r\nBelow is my React component code as per ES6 class style, DO I NEED to worry about this warning, or what should I do because I have created my React component as per standard guideline mentioned on this link https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/04/07/react-v15.5.0.html#migrating-from-react.createclass : \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\r\n\r\nclass App extends Component {\r\n  static contextTypes = {\r\n        .....\r\n  };\r\n  static propTypes = {\r\n        .....\r\n  };\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n               ....\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n  componentDidMount(){\r\n    const { params, location, actions } = this.props;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default App;\r\n```\r\nCan you please guide me what should I do to remove these warnings ? I don't want use 'create-react-class' which is drop-in-replacement. I want to stick to the pattern of ES6 class in my existing React ver 15.6.2 without upgrading to React 16. So Can you please enlight some approaches I should follow on this ?\r\n",
