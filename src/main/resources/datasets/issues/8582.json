  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nAn onTouchEnd event that leads to the rendering of an input element at the location of the original touched element will focus the input element, which means that the touch is **reused** for the new input element.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\r\n\r\nYou can check out the following fiddle to reproduce it: https://jsfiddle.net/7bxvby79/2/\r\n\r\n1. Open the mobile device mode in chrome, or open the fiddle from a touch device\r\n2. Zoom in so that a touch on \"Click here\" will fully land (theoretically) in the input element behind it (Double click somewhere)\r\n3. Touch \"Click here\"\r\n-> The input element is now focused.\r\n\r\nYou can also see this gif in case the repro steps are unclear: http://giphy.com/gifs/3o7TKFm2J9LAs1zn6U\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe input element should not be focused, because it does not exist when it is touched yet.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n15.4.1, it does also not work on 15.3., Chrome, Android Chrome Web View, maybe more browsers\r\n",
