  "body": "For fun, I tried to make a separate internal class for functional components.\nPreviously this was attempted in #3995.\n\nThis is work in progress. I’d like to measure perf implications of this but haven’t had the time yet.\nThe one feature that I don’t support here is factory components:\n\n``` js\nfunction Foo(props) {\n  return {\n    render() { return <div />\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThey are very inconvenient with our OOP internal hierarchy because we don’t know whether we’re dealing with a functional or a factory component until we call the function at least once.\n\nI assume this is the same reason #3995 got shoot down. However I don’t think I’ve ever seen a “factory component” in the wild and I’m not convinced in the utility of supporting them. Who are their users?\n\nShallow rendering is also broken in this PR, but I think it’s fixable.\n",
