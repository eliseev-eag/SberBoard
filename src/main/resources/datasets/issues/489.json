  "body": "JSXTransformer currently produces suboptimal code when _fixed strings_ are inserted with braces, `{'Abc'}` or `{\"Abc\"}`, as is required if you want to override the JSX whitespace collapsing.\n\nThis means that `<div>A{'\\n'}B</div>` does not generate 1 div, but 1 div and 3 spans `<div><span>A</span><span>\\n</span><span>B</span></div>` rather than just `<div><span>A\\nB</span></div>`.\n\nMy proposed changes treats `{'Abc'}` and `{\"Abc\"}`, and ONLY those as if they were actually written inline without braces, but _after_ whitespace collapsing has occured, so their content is exactly what ends up in the DOM. To clarify `{StringVar}`, `{'A'+'B'}` and even `{('Abc')}` are _not transformed_, so this will have no effect on runtime keying.\n\nIf my PR for stricter whitespace collapsing rules is accepted, this will hopefully be less of an issue. But still, a single `{'\\n'}` can cause 0 spans to become 3 which can be a heavy price considering the DOM is the costly part, and this is part of the JSXTransformer which in my opinion, should make a reasonable effort to generate \"fast code\" as long as it doesn't affect readability.\n\nI also removed a duplicated piece of code (I can move it into it's own PR), because it simplifies the implementation of this PR.\n### Example\n\n```\n<div>\n  abc{'\\n'}def\n  def{\" \\t\"}ghi\n  ghi{Var}jkl\n  jkl{' '+Var}mno\n</div>\n```\n### Before\n\nAlthough a contrived example, this will end up creating 9 spans.\n\n```\nReact.DOM.div(null, \n  'abc','\\n','def '+\n  'def',\" \\t\",'ghi '+\n  'ghi',Var,'jkl '+\n  'jkl',' '+Var,'mno'\n)\n```\n### After\n\nAfter fixed strings have been concatenated, only 5 spans will be generated. Note that the two expressions with `Var` have not been concatenated, but remains as arguments, and as such still have their own spans.\n\n```\nReact.DOM.div(null, \n  'abc'+'\\n'+'def '+\n  'def'+\" \\t\"+'ghi '+\n  'ghi',Var,'jkl '+\n  'jkl',' '+Var,'mno'\n)\n```\n",
