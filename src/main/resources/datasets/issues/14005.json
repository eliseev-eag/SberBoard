  "body": "This is a request to support consuming multiple contexts from within a class component without creating artificial wrapper components. Looking at the new hooks proposal it seems that the underlying infrastructure is capable of propagating changes from multiple contexts to a single component but this does not seem to be exposing outside of hooks. I would love to see it available in class components using an approach not unlike the old context API where you declare a static `contextTypes` field on the function which would expose multiple values to the component..\r\n\r\nTo differentiate from the old api the value in the `contextTypes` object MUST be the context object.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Theme context, default to light theme\r\nconst ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');\r\n\r\n// Signed-in user context\r\nconst UserContext = React.createContext({name: 'Guest'});\r\n\r\nButton.contextTypes = {\r\n  theme: ThemeContext,\r\n  user: UserContext\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should be able to be distinguished from the old context API where the props are typically `PropTypes.*` references. i.e\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nButton.contextTypes = {\r\n  color: PropTypes.string\r\n};\r\n```\r\n",
