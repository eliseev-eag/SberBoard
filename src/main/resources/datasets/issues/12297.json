Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nPlease clone [this repository](https://github.com/karak/react-unmount-issue) and execute `yarn test`.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n1. To report those errors at every test case.\r\n1. To provide a proper way to handle them, especially for testing (already exists?).\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.2.0\r\n",
