  "body": "In react@0.14 special symbol is uset to mark `React.Element` instances. Unfortunately the symbol is used as a value of the for `$$typeof` field rather than a name. It would be really great it was other way round like:\n\n``` js\n// The Symbol used to tag the ReactElement type. If there is no native Symbol\n// nor polyfill, then a plain number is used for performance.\nvar IS_REACT_ELEMENT =\n  (typeof Symbol === 'function' && Symbol.for && Symbol.for('react.element')) ||\n  0xeac7;\n\n\nvar ReactElement = function(type, key, ref, self, source, owner, props) {\n  var element = {\n    // This tag allow us to uniquely identify this as a React Element\n    [IS_REACT_ELEMENT]: true,\n\n    // Built-in properties that belong on the element\n    type: type,\n    key: key,\n    ref: ref,\n    props: props,\n\n    // Record the component responsible for creating this element.\n    _owner: owner,\n  };\n```\n\nAs that would allow instances that implement multiple interfaces VS being exclusive. For that matter it would be great if all other fields were also symbols.\n",
