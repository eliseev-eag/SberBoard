  "body": "Hi there, I just spent a half hour realizing that I was passing the string of \"none\" to an overflowX and there was no warnings or logs in my JSX for a style I was passing invalid.  It simply removed it from my inline styles with no warnings or errors.\r\n\r\nI would like to send a pull request to react to help with this and add logging for developers who accidentally pass an invalid string to warn them that things like this are invalid.\r\n\r\nI was even passing it in a class and my browser was barfing too which helped me realize that its overflowX \"hidden\" is the valid attribute CSS value.\r\n\r\nAny idea if there is a way we can log this to console for invalid CSS attributes that just \"disappear\" from the JSX final inline style converted object?  I would love for there to be logs on invalid css attributes or maybe there is some configuration I am missing to see these logs from react?  It was very annoying to try to get this overflow and \"none\" is invalid.\r\n\r\nNext time I am doing CSS and something is missing, I will look up the mozilla manual.\r\n\r\nThanks for any pointers with this annoying little bugger with JSX.",
