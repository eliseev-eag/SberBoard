  "body": "This doesn't actually work. I haven't played with Prepack much before so I'm not sure what exactly we need to do. The good news is that we can actually know if we fix the issues thanks to the new bundle tests :-)\r\n\r\nReact DOM currently ends up empty for some reason. Maybe need to model a DOM environment for its initialization.\r\n\r\nIn the past when I've tried Prepack, it emitted terribly large code for DOM injections because they create dictionaries that are large when serialized. But I plan to later remove those injections anyway. SimpleEventPlugin also has this problem.",
