  "body": "I’m working through upgrading some renderers and documentation to the current master build (installing from http://react.zpao.com/builds/master/latest/).\n\nFrom following along I knew there were some hard breaking changes I wanted to begin a discussion on what commitments React is willing to make at this time to support this use case.\n\nRather than trying to figure all of the current APIs needed up front I’d like to begin this by looking at the `Mount\\* entry point and discuss what APIs could be exposed and which should be covered in other APIs.\n## ReactMount\n\n[ReactMount](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/eaefd9052ae41d3318a2add286828a75da362193/src/renderers/dom/client/ReactMount.js), [ReactNativeMount](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/1c5a639c37039a9c60752980dfee168129b76b32/src/renderers/native/ReactNativeMount.js), and [ReactTestMount](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/c78464f8ea9a5b00ec80252d20a71a1482210e57/src/renderers/testing/ReactTestMount.js) are the entry points to three Facebook/React supported renderers. They all live in this codebase and have first class access to a number of internals that external renderers do not currently get.\n\nSpecifically, a few modules that each access are:\n- [`ReactReconciler`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd0c65c6aa7c80eeeb0783e29bef89399b5796af/src/renderers/shared/stack/reconciler/ReactReconciler.js)\n- [`instantiateReactComponent`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd0c65c6aa7c80eeeb0783e29bef89399b5796af/src/renderers/shared/stack/reconciler/instantiateReactComponent.js) a helper function to create the correct React Component type (host, composite, text, ...). Also a part of the reconciler\n- [`ReactUpdates`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/a3e576e1bb80f674fa685966ce415fc65238638c/src/renderers/shared/stack/reconciler/ReactUpdates.js) : my understanding is this is a part of ReactReconciler\n- [`ReactInstrumentation`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/0d927844fba35df4956e904fdb33e2f7a034eace/src/renderers/shared/ReactInstrumentation.js) bridge between React internals and devtools (not limited to just the [React DevTools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/)\n\n(There are a few other modules that I see used between FB and my own renderers beyond these that may be worth future consideration, though these are what I understand to be the most important to unblock renderer development.)\n\nMy understanding is that a renderers `Mount` method is dependent upon the reconciler to bridge the renderer semantics to React core. The reconciler has become effectively private and non-shareable with the recent build changes.\n\nWhat can be done today to allow renderers to continue existing and experimenting in the 16.x release cycle?\n\nA few initial ideas to get feedback on for possible direction (if any) would be acceptable. With both of these ideas comes developer/console warnings that this is an unsupported and non-guaranteed API that could break at any moment including patch releases:\n- Expose minimal Reconciler surface area\n- Create a `ReactReconciler` package\n",
