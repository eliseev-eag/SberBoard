However, after publishing to npm and using the published version in the local react app everything works as expected.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n1. Create a library that's built with hooks (my-hooks-lib)\r\n2. Create a local app that uses the library (my-react-app) using CRA\r\n3. `yarn link` in my-hooks-lib and in my-react-app run `yarn link my-hooks-lib`\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n`yarn start` in the react app should use hooks and render normally\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nreact and react-dom `16.7.0-alpha.2`\r\nOSX\r\n",
