  "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR adds some scaffolding to React needed for the event API experiment that we're testing out internally at Facebook. The API will be behind a `enableEventAPI` flag to ensure the logic is kept in isolation.\r\n\r\nThis scaffolding in this PR doesn't add any functionality. This PR inserts placeholders, symbols for the new fibers, functions and tags/types in preparation for follow up PRs that add the implementations. In the interests of making this experimental event API easier to review and consume, I've opted to create lots of smaller PRs.\r\n\r\nThis PR is only one part of the work to add the event API, so expect other PRs that expand on this and fill in the implementations. https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15036 is the previous part of work.\r\n\r\nI plan on writing up an RFC explaining this event API, along with how the internals work (such as the new symbols) once we've had a chance to iron out some details internally.\r\n",
