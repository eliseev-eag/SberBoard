  "body": "Found a few issues:\r\n\r\n* Some Node versions crash when null character gets passed to path utils. Fixing this by ignoring Rollup internal path identifiers that start with it.\r\n* `require.resolve()` only supports the `paths` option since Node 8.9.0. So I'm adding another way to do it for older Nodes based on what ESLint did.",
