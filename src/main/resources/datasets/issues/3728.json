  "body": "I have been looking at #3598 and found out requiring Polymer (actually, WebComponents.js) breaks the tests with messages like:\n\n```\n    Error: Assertion failed in http://192.86.0.1:9999/test/\n```\n\nCommenting out https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/browser/ui/__tests__/ReactMount-test.js#L23 will make all tests green. \n\nIt seems like Polymer in Chrome does not override original DOM constructors therefore no errors occur in Chrome, but in latest Safari and Firefox, about 3x tests gets failed due to this.\n",
