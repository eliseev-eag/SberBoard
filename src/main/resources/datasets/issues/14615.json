  "body": "It's confusing when you mix those â€” e.g. if you render with `createRoot().render()` but then call `unmountComponentAtNode()`. Sometimes it warns with misleading warnings, and sometimes (in particular, if there's existing content) it didn't warn at all. We don't have guarantees around how it works either (e.g. unmounting doesn't work).\r\n\r\nI added an explicit DEV-only flag for whether something is a new-style root, and I warn whenever you try to mix the API one way or the other. The message suggests the right API to use. I didn't change the behavior.\r\n\r\nI didn't clean up false positive further warnings because the code for them is all over the place and it's hard to untangle the assumptions. So warning at entry point seemed like the easiest thing to do. We want to keep these worlds separate anyway.",
