I found the call stack has `(anonymous)` function name, it was made by [below](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/v16.1.0/packages/react-dom/src/client/ReactDOM.js#L746-L748)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nDOMRenderer.unbatchedUpdates(() => {\r\n   DOMRenderer.updateContainer(children, newRoot, parentComponent, callback);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n**The captured picture**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6913898/32690119-7f9ad248-c6b6-11e7-962e-7ffbe33b17a0.png)\r\n\r\n~~**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template for React 16: https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/, template for React 15: https://jsfiddle.net/hmbg7e9w/).**~~\r\n\r\nSorry No.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nHow about define function name for this ?\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
