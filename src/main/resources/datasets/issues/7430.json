  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nReport a bug.\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\nThe `HTMLDOMPropertyConfig` object [includes an `icon` property](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cccef3c68310df3bd611df2a7b98a530645c67c0/src/renderers/dom/shared/HTMLDOMPropertyConfig.js#L85) in a section title `Standard Properties`, but `icon` isn’t an attribute supported by any standard HTML element.\n\n`icon` is not included in the HTML4 or HTML5 specs:\n[List of HTML4 attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/index/attributes.html)\n[List of HTML5 attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/index.html#attributes-1)\n\nMozilla Developer Network includes `icon` in its [list of attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes), but specifies the only element to use `icon` is the [obsolete `<command>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/command). `<command>` isn’t supported in [any desktop or mobile browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/command#Browser_compatibility).\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nThe `icon` property might be better placed in the section titled [`Non-standard Properties`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cccef3c68310df3bd611df2a7b98a530645c67c0/src/renderers/dom/shared/HTMLDOMPropertyConfig.js#L174-L202), or removed altogether. The [documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tags-and-attributes.html#html-attributes) for HTML attributes could omit `icon` too.\n\nI encountered this issue when working with TypeScript, and I opened an issue about the React type definition at https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/10467. Because React itself includes `icon`, custom interfaces which extend [DefinitelyTyped’s `React.HTMLAttributes`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/613673de3672114c562fdf9f142bfeefc29173c9/react/react.d.ts#L1968) cannot include a non-string `icon` property.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n`icon` was added in a React 0.4.0 alpha in 2013: https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/203dba271b6128f03c99b1ce2f573a316adb4e4e. The commit message mentions `mostly this was to better support some HTML5 stuff`—it’s possible `icon` was part of a draft of the HTML5 standard at the time, but was omitted in the final spec.\n",
