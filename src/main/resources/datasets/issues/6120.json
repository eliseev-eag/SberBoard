  "body": "This error takes a significant amount of time to debug and reason out where the offending object is being put into the tree. Is there any more information the error message could provide than the keys? It would help to know which line in the code is setting the object as a child. The stack trace has no reference to any of the code in my render() so am forced to step thru all lines of code, which does not always reveal the culprit. So at least starting on a given line would speed up the process of elimination. The keys help but still not enough to determine a precise cause in the code.\n\nIt would help if there was a way to detect this condition in the debugger. I've tried things like:\n\n```\n            const fields = buildFieldsFromData();\n            fields.forEach(d => {\n                // if (!ReactDOM.isValidChildContent(d)) debugger;\n                if (typeof d === 'object' && !_.isArray(d) && !d.hasOwnProperty('$$typeof')) {\n                    debugger; // never catches my bad child\n                }\n            });\n            return fields;\n```\n\nreferences\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/33117449/invariant-violation-objects-are-not-valid-as-a-react-child\n",
