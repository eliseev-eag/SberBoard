  "body": "I would like to point out a specific behaviour when using React with IE and Edge.\r\n\r\nI am building a user-computer chat application where users are presented prompts to navigate them through a user journey. One of the steps is where the user enters a street name/postcode and they are presented a list of addresses to choose from. Therefore I have a step with a text input field which after the user submits disappears for a list of addresses to appear.\r\n\r\nI have an example where there are two ways for submitting. One is by clicking on a send button, and the other is by hitting 'Enter' on a keyboard. When the user uses the mouse submission everything is ok on all browsers, however if the user presses the keyboard key then click events do not work as expected on IE and Edge.\r\n\r\nMy assumption is that the problem comes because the field that has the focus is deleted from the DOM but I can't be sure. To make things stranger I could only reproduce the issue by putting the addresses in the list in two nested div elements with display:flex set in the styles.\r\n\r\nHere is a link to a fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/rcvx5uLt/\r\n\r\nExpected: After a value is entered in the input and enter is pressed or send is clicked I would expect the list of addresses provided to be clickable.\r\n\r\nActual:\r\n- When a value is entered end send is clicked with the mouse the events on the list items can be tracked.\r\n- When a value is entered and Enter is pressed the events on the list can't be tracked.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am using react 15.4.2 with IE 11.713.10586.0 and  Edge 25.10586.672.0/EdgeHTML 13.10586.\r\n",
