  "body": "_setState()_ currently accepts an optional second argument for callback and returns _undefined_.\n\nThis results in a callback hell for a very stateful component. Having it return a promise would make it much more managable.\n\nIt is somewhat of a convention in JS world to have API symmetric - if a method accepts a callback, it returns a promise. if it returns a promise, it can accept a callback.\n\nIn my case, I have an editable table. If user presses enter, he is moved to the next row (call setState). If the user is on a last row, I'd like to create a new row (call setState) and focus on this new row (call setState). Currently the only way is to achieve this is to have a nested callback hell.\n",
