  "body": "We mistakenly used `required` attribute to style `label` element, such as\n\n``` html\n<label required>\n<label>\n\nlabel[required] {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nSoon we found that `label`'s attribute can not be removed in 0.14.x:\n\n``` js\nReactDOM.render(<label required>, container);\n// update immediately\nReactDOM.render(<label>, container);\n```\n\nAfter running the above code, The `required` attribute is still on `label` element. \n\nThen I realize `required` is not an attribute of `label` by [standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#the-label-element), just an attribute of some other elements(like `input`, etc..), so I think `required` should not be allowed to render at component mount phase like other arbitrary names(such as xyz), else it will cause people confusion.\n\nAnd I notice that 0.15.x solves this problem by a flag(`MUST_USE_PROPERTY`), so `required`  is rendered at component mount and will be removed correctly, but is inconsistent with other attributes(select/checked) which is not rendered at all.\n\nSo should react validate attributes by element like `validateDOMNesting`?\n",
