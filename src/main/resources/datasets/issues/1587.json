  "body": "It would be great if in debug mode react would warn you when you pass in a property on props which is not specified in the propTypes object for that component. i.e. a way to enforce that props should ONLY have the props specified in propTypes and no others. \n\nThis would prevent use of undocumented properties and also allow better code maintenance as unused props would be more easily removed.\n",
