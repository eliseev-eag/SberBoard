  "body": "Currently, when creating elements React checks for various namespaces like SVG and uses `createElementNS`, but when it's HTML it does not apply a namespace (at least in `ReactDOMComponent.Mixin.mountComponent` it checks, there are other places that do `document.createElement` without any checking).\n\nIn Firefox, we are starting to use React in XUL pages. We are trying to get off of XUL as fast as we can, but we need a migration path. When using React in a XUL page, it will create XUL elements by default because that is the default namespace (and a XUL `div` is different than a HTML `div`).\n\nIs there any chance you all could apply the HTML namespace when creating elements? It would look like `document.createElementNS(\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\", tag)` instead of the normal `createElement` call.\n\nIf that's not possible, is there anything React can do to help us out? If not, we're going to have to fork React and change all `createElement` calls to `createElementNS`, which isn't hard (I've already done it) but I wanted to ask here first before we fork it. I'm fine forking it for now, in while when we are mostly HTML we can drop the fork.\n",
