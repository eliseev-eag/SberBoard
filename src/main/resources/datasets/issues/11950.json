  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug, I think unless this behavior is intentional.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nYou can see it here: https://jsfiddle.net/wunmrhcj/\r\n\r\nBasically I am trying to batch a set of ajax calls by wrapping them in a promise that calls setTimeout.  I've replaced actually ajax calls with calls to console.log() but the affect is the same. The first time the update function is called you can see the console log each statement within a single ms of each other statement. The next time the update function is called (12 seconds later) you can see that the console log statements are delayed as expected.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI expect the sleep function to work the first time it is called. As it stands now my UI is broken until the interval calls the update function again (which is 3 minutes in production).  \r\n\r\nI understand async stuff in React is a lil funky and I definitely don't know how React works under the hood so this could be intentional behavior somehow. If it is, why is it needed and is there any workaround so that I can get the behavior I need? Thanks guys and keep up the great work.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 15 but I believe this happens on React 16 as well. I'm on Firefox Developer Edition 57.0b7",
