  "body": "This aligns the behavior for roots with error boundaries. When a root unmounts as a result of an error, if the Fresh runtime is running, it will record its last rendered element in a Map.\r\n\r\nThere is a new `scheduleRoot(root, element)` DevTools hook. Fresh runtime calls it on update for all failed roots with their last rendered elements. This offers us an opportunity to remount the tree.\r\n\r\nWe remove a root from the failed map if there is a further update on it that isn't caused by an error. In order to determine whether an update is caused by an error, we check `effectTag`. This is done before calling `onCommitFiberRoot` so that Fresh runtime itself doesn't depend on a particular tag constant.",
