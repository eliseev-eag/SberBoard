  "body": "Historically we haven’t been very good at explaining how to contribute to React.\nWe have a [small guide](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) but it doesn’t offer crucial information about:\n- Our build process and `providesModule`.\n- Design constraints that guide what gets in and what doesn’t.\n- Conventions like `invariant`, `warning`, `__DEV__`, and infra around them.\n- How we introduce breaking changes and deprecations.\n- How syncing with React Native and Facebook website affects contributions.\n- Basic directory organization, what can or can’t go in either directory.\n- Unfortunate decisions in the codebase that we want to get away from.\n- What is being actively worked on, and why.\n- An internal glossary:\n  - Elements\n  - Public instances\n  - Internal instances\n  - Composite components\n  - Native components\n  - Reconciliation\n  - Transactions\n  - Update queue\n  - Synthetic events\n\nWhat do you think? I’m especially interested in hearing from people who considered contributing to React but were turned away by the internal complexity.\n",
