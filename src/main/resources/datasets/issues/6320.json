  "body": "Currently the only info I could find about the `callback` argument of the `setState` method is this:\n\n> The second (optional) parameter is a callback function that will be executed once setState is completed and the component is re-rendered.\n\nI've been working on a small tool that relies on the callbacks being called, and I found out that in some cases that never happened: the state was set, the callback was pushed into the queue, then the component was unmounted and the callback was lost and never called.\n\nNow, I don't say that I can't infer the possibility of such scenario from the description above, but an info about when exactly can such callback be considered lost would be helpful. My findings suggest that `componentWillUnmount` is the right place, but I'd be more confident with some assurance from the creators of React :)\n\nAlso this description suggests that when `shouldComponentUpdate` returns `false` (so the component is not re-rendered), the callback will not be called - which is not the case, as the callback still gets called.\n\nI'm using React 0.14.7.\n",
