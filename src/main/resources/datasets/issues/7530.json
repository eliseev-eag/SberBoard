  "body": "We hit a snag on a project where a piece of state backing a checkbox was set to `null` instead of `false`, and the checkbox checked state was not reflected in the UI.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Visit https://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/53315/\n2. Click \"toggle\" to show the checkbox\n3. Check the checkbox\n4. Click \"toggle\" to hide the checkbox\n5. Click \"toggle\" to show the checkbox (it should be checked)\n6. Click \"Reset\"\n\n**Expected:** The checkbox is no longer checked\n**Actual:** The checkbox is checked\n\nHere's a recording of the behavior:\n\n![toggle](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/590904/17814610/a2803e84-65fe-11e6-9cd7-db2a34987440.gif)\n\nIt looks like this happens because `null` returns a controlled input to the initial checked state (inst._wrapperState.initialChecked) it was mounted with:\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/client/wrappers/ReactDOMInput.js#L78\n\nTo me, this is inconsistent with the behavior of other attributes. If given `null`, [the attribute is removed](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/shared/ReactDOMComponent.js#L1064). Additionally, if `input.checked` is assigned `null` directly, it becomes unchecked. \n\nThis PR configures `ReactDOMInput` to respect `null` for controlled checkboxes. It will only ever fallback to initial mounted value on `undefined`.\n\nIf a change like this is impossible, could there be a warning or additional documentation along the lines of [tips/controlled-input-null-value](https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/controlled-input-null-value.html)? I'm happy to follow up with an issue if so (I'll even write the docs, if given a formal stance).\n",
