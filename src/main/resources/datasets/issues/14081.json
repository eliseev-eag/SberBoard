  "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nThis is just a question to clarify a behavior. Am I correct to assume that using new Hooks API would enable developers to create essentially memoized selectors by making a custom memoized hook that would read given values from reducer?\r\n\r\nSomething which vary vaguely would be like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Defining a custom Hook for mapping values from reducer in any combination\r\n// necessary. getTodos is just a simple wrapper for:\r\n// state => state.main.todos\r\nconst useFromReducer = React.memo(([ state, dispatch ]) => ({\r\n  todos: getTodos(state),\r\n  dispatch\r\n}));\r\n\r\n// Then used in pure component like this:\r\nconst { todos, dispatch } = useFromReducer(useReducer(\r\n  rootReducer,\r\n  rootReducerInitialState,   \r\n  mainActions.resetTodos\r\n));\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo doesn't that essentially mean if I wish to get any combination of data from different reducers like for example could be done in \"Reselect\", I could create a it's logic inside the hook from multiple different reducers, and just pass it as a Custom Hook to the using component? Am I completely off the base if I sense this could make it able to create Reselect like memoized selectors by hand with hooks? That would be seriously awesome! ðŸ˜„",
