  "body": "Maybe fixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11538.\r\n\r\nGoogle Translate modifies the DOM in an unsupported way: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11538#issuecomment-390386520. It seems like what it does is pretty limited though (wrapping text nodes into DOM elements). Given how often Google Translate is used, it seems like it would be nice to be resilient to this particular case.\r\n\r\nMy strategy is that if `parentNode` is missing we know somebody messed with our DOM. We search for a node at the same position in the host parent as the now-detached node. We do this by reusing the existing Fiber host sibling search logic that we apply at the commit phase. If we find a node at that position, and it's *not* managed by React, we assume it's the node we need to use for best effort. Worst case â€” we'll crash anyway.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that this adds a single `.parentNode` equality check on every insertion and deletion. Maybe there's a more scoped strategy. But maybe this is okay?",
