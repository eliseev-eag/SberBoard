It took me a few hours of fiddling around based on information pulled from numerous sources to get it working. I've condensed what worked for me into a section of a more general Troubleshooting guild in the wiki and linked it from the main README.md in the hopes that it will provide some relief to the next contributor. Ideally the community can expand on this guide.\n",
