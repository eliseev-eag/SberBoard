  "body": "This is the start of reimplementing `ReactTestRenderer` on Fiber. Current tests status:\r\n\r\n- [x] renders a simple component (2ms)\r\n- [x] renders a top-level empty component\r\n- [x] exposes a type flag (2ms)\r\n- [x] can render a composite component (1ms)\r\n- [x] renders some basics with an update\r\n- [x] exposes the instance (1ms)\r\n- [x] updates types (1ms)\r\n- [x] updates children\r\n- [x] does the full lifecycle (1ms)\r\n- [x] gives a ref to native components (2ms)\r\n- [x] warns correctly for refs on SFCs\r\n- [x] allows an optional createNodeMock function\r\n- [x] supports unmounting when using refs\r\n- [x] supports unmounting inner instances (3ms)\r\n- [x] supports updates when using refs\r\n- [x] supports error boundaries\r\n- [x] compatibility: add support for `unstable_batchedUpdates`\r\n\r\nA good chunk of those tests have to do with refs and the ability to provide a `createNodeMock` function. I believe that `ReactFiberReconciler` will need to be updated with a `getPublicInstance` method to handle this.\r\n\r\nIgnore all changes in `ReactTestRenderer-test.js`. The first is to import the fiber renderer instead of stack (actually, is there a better way to do this? should I copy the ReactTestRenderer-test for ReactTestFiberRenderer?), the rest are testing/skip/etc and will be backed out when done.\r\n\r\ncc @spicyj ",
