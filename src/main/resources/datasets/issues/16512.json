  "body": "I'm having a component, which is facing a lot of \"unnecessary\" renders because it it located at a relatively low level in the component stack. Up to now I was using `shouldComponentUpdate` comparing internal state with the given `nextState` in order to determine, if it is OK to re-render. I'm wondering now, how this could be done with hooks. AFAIK `memo` is just covering the props changes, but what about state change comparisons? \r\n",
