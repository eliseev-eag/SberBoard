  "body": "Since the recent update to Chrome in the Canary and Beta branches, React apps which contain an object tag fail fatally (rendering is halted due to internal exception).\r\n\r\nThis is because it seems the chromium devs have altered the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet foo = document.createElement('object');\r\nfoo.test = 5;\r\n// foo.test is undefined here in Chome 56 (beta)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason this kills react is [this line](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/aca2e0403691a2842d4a9d8964c9b1016e248b6a/src/renderers/dom/shared/ReactDOMComponentTree.js#L60).\r\n\r\nWe try stick some arbitrary object onto the end of the element (a cached HTMLElement -> component relationship i suppose). So if an object tag hits this caching code, it'll throw an exception eventually when something tries to access the instance.\r\n\r\nThis means if the change reaches Chrome stable, too, quite a few react apps could \"randomly\" stop working (as users update their browsers).",
