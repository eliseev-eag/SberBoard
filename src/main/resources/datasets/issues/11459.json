  "body": "I've a basic query in react native. I've a side menu with n level expandable options (categories->subcategories->...) & I've to make it in react native. I've already research a lot but I'm unable to find any significant solution for this thing. Any help will be appreciated as I am new to react native and only have basic knowledge in it. May be, by creating dynamic components it can be done but if already implemented than it will help me a lot as it is something that is very frequently needed in development. ",
