  "body": "**Current behavior**:\r\n  I have a component that is composed of multiple select elements each tied to different variables in the state. I have a setTimeout that changes only one of the select value. This causes other select values to be changed\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n  https://www.webpackbin.com/bins/-KfSVw3Ww4ZGFSaJ5_WY\r\n\r\nThe above webpack bin instance works as expected in chrome and safari but not in firefox.\r\n\r\n**Issue**:\r\n  In Firefox the value of select elements (the ones not set inside a `setTimeout`) reverts back to the first value instead of the previously set one.\r\n\r\n**React version**: 15.4.2\r\n**OS**: Mac\r\n**Browser affected by this change**: Firefox \r\n\r\nPlease feel free to close the issue if this is not a bug (or a known bug in firefox) and that I am doing something wrong. I tried searching for issues related to firefox and select elements and couldn't find any that looked similar.",
