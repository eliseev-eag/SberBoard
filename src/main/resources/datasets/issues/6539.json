  "body": "When using React in a project along with a module compiler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) with [UglifyJs](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2) to remove comments in code. The current license comment in React is removed as it doesn't conform to [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) [@license](http://usejsdoc.org/tags-license.html).\n\nI suggest this is added so the license doesnt get removed by default and so people don't have to implement a work around to keep the license in a project.\n",
