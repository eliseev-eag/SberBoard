  "body": "Scheduler is used by the renderers, but not the isomorphic package.\r\n\r\nI checked the history to figure out why it was originally added as a dep. It looks like it was because the UMD build of `react` includes Scheduler inline instead of treating it as an external: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13509\r\n\r\nWe may need to reconsider our UMD strategy later once the public Scheduler API is stable. (Personally I would prefer to drop UMD support entirely.)\r\n\r\nRegardless we can remove it from `package.json`. I confirmed that the UMD bundle still includes Scheduler.",
