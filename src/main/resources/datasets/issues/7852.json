  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\n\nBug report\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\n\nOn Safari 10:\nGiven a document with 2 `input` fields, separated by an `svg` that uses a `xlinkHref`, when focusing the first and pressing the tab key, the focus is not switched to the second input. Instead the address bar or another browser element gets focused.\n\nI am not sure if this is an issue with React or with Safari, but I could not reproduce it on Safari without using React, so I am opening this issue here.\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem**\n\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/zete1of2/\n\nTry to use the tab key to jump from the first to the second input field.\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n\nPressing the tab key sets focus on the second input field (works fine on other browsers)\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\nSafari Version 10.0 (11602.1.50.0.10)\nOSX 10.11.6\nReact 15.3.2 \n",
