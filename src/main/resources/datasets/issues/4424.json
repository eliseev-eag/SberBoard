  "body": "`Children.only` is intended to be called on an opaque `Children` object (eg. `this.props.children`).  Best as I can tell, `Children.map` is intended to return an opaque `Children` object.  But `Children.only` can't be called on the return value of `Children.map`, as per https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4410#issuecomment-122199087\n\nIt seems very reasonable to want to map your only child to another element (clone element, for instance), and then grab the only child from the map and use it to render.  It is also very surprising for the identity operation to be passed into map, but the thing that comes out to not be semantically equivalent.\n\nIssue demonstrated here: https://jsfiddle.net/9Ldyq5jk/4/\n",
