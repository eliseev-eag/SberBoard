Its primary purpose is to let people know how to prepare for subsequent 16.4 release.\r\n\r\nFor **application developers**, this post should explain how to run the codemod to rename the deprecated methods (reactjs/react-codemod/pull/195) as well as general strategies for how to use the new lifecycle(s) instead.\r\n\r\nFor **library maintainers**, this should provide recommended update and release strategies including:\r\n* What kinds of code can be moved into `render` (to remain backwards compatible) vs what needs to either remain in `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps` or moved to the new `static getDerivedStateFromProps` method.\r\n* When peer dependency version changes are required.\r\n* What versions of React will support the new `UNSAFE_` methods.",
