  "body": "I'm using React to render on the server and on the client. On the client I'm getting this error message:\n\n```\nWarning: React attempted to reuse markup in a container but the checksum was invalid. This generally means that you are using server rendering and the markup generated on the server was not what the client was expecting. React injected new markup to compensate which works but you have lost many of the benefits of server rendering. Instead, figure out why the markup being generated is different on the client or server:\n (client) <div data-reactid=\"\n (server) <div data-reactid=\"\n```\n\nBesides the checksum being present in the server rendered HTML, the rendered HTML is exactly the same on both the client and server. \n\nThere is a visual issue with `&copy;` rendering as `Â©` (but this is still rendered the same on both the server and the client).\n\nThe React [doco](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-gotchas.html) says HTML entities in literal text should work fine. Removing the HTML entity `&copy;` makes the checksum error message go away.\n\n``` javascript\nrender() {\n  return <footer>&copy; 2015</footer>;\n}\n```\n\nAm I doing something wrong or is this a bug?\n\nI'm using react 0.14.2 rendered on express viewed in chrome.\n",
