  "body": "Apparently we support rendering into iframes (@petehunt), but we always render new markup into the global document and then move rendered elements into the iframe document afterwards. JSDOM throws `Wrong document` if you try to do this but browsers don't seem to mind.\n\nHowever, apart from perhaps not being very nice for various reasons, it seems to affect performance _significantly_: http://jsperf.com/renderdoc2 IE11 drops down to 33% performance and FF drops to about 20% (!) when rendering into the global document and moving rather than rendering directly into the iframe document.\n\nThis is easily solved everywhere except for `processUpdates` as renders into different documents are batched as well?\n\ncc @spicyj @zpao\n",
