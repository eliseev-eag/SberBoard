Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nUnable to provide an example at this time.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nSince `<button/>` has the class `--is-disabled`, it should have background-color === grey, as defined in the css.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact.16.8.6\r\nOS: Windows 10\r\nBrowser: Internet Explorer 11 \r\n\r\nThis was working as expected previously\r\nwhen we were using React 16.1.1 and did not implement route-based code-splitting.\r\n",
