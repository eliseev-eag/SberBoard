  "body": "I've just stumbled across some code written which touches this.state directly and then forces an update.  The danger in this pattern is that _appears_ to work, it still leaves the code vulnerable to other callers of setState doing the right thing, being queued up, and then overwriting the hand-touched state, if I'm understanding the red box on http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-api.html correctly.\n\nAny chance if, in (at least) the dev version, this.state could be guarded with a JS setter that would print a warning?\n",
