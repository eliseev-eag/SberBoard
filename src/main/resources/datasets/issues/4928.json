  "body": "I put an inline comment in my jsx to document a table cell:\n\n```\n<tr>\n  <td>foo</td> {/* a comment about this cell */}\n</tr>\n```\n\nThe first time it renders, everything looks fine, but when it re-renders, it hits an error where it cant find a DOM node.  What's happening is that the space between the `</td>` and the `{/*` is turned into an additional whitespace child of the `<tr>`, and the browser throws it out.  The unintuitive thing is that if the comment weren't there and it was just a line with trailing whitespace, the whitespace would instead be stripped out.\n\nI understand the JSX transformer is content-unaware and it totally makes sense why this is happening, but this is a bit of a gotcha coming from other programming/markup languages so I figured I would report it and see if we can come up with a solution.  Maybe table-related components could be smarter about filtering out whitespace children since they are invalid (as far as i know)?\n\nObviously I'll work around it for now by butting the comment up against the cell.\n",
