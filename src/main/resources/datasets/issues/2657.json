  "body": "I noticed that legacy attributes like align, cellpadding, cellspacing wasn't rendered by React (at least on the server side).\n\nIt is annoying for me since i was trying to convert our email templating system to use React in order to be able to display them in our frontend app.\n\nThe fact is that i'm unable to complete this task with React. It led to another question. How am i supposed to make React and WebComponents work together if custom element/attributes names are filtered by React rendering engine ?\n",
