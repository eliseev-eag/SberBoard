  "body": "The noop renderer has its own mock implementation of the Scheduler interface, with the ability to partially render work in tests. Now that this functionality has been lifted into a proper mock Scheduler build, we can use that instead.\r\n\r\nMost of the existing noop tests were unaffected, but I did have to make some changes. The biggest one involved passive effects: previously, they were scheduled on a separate queue from the queue that handles rendering. After this change, both rendering and effects are scheduled in the Scheduler queue. I think this is a better approach because tests no longer have to worry about the difference; if you call `flushAll`, all the work is flushed, both rendering and effects. But for those few tests that do care to flush the rendering without the effects, that's still possible using the `yieldValue` API.\r\n\r\nFollow-up: Do the same for test renderer.",
