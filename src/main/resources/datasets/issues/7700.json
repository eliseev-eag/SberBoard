  "body": "I want to report a bug.\n\nI have an input the value of which is set from this.state. And this value is manipulated using onKeyDown event. In my console i have the next error:\n\n> Warning: Failed form propType: You provided a `value` prop to a form field without an `onChange` handler. This will render a read-only field. If the field should be mutable use `defaultValue`. Otherwise, set either `onChange` or `readOnly`. Check the render method of `TimePicker`.\n> So my input is not readonly it gets edited which means that this error is nonexistent.\n\nTo reproduce this you could add an `<input />` with value from `this.state` and `onKeyDown` handler and no `onChange` handler. Something like this:\n\n```\nclass MyInput extends React.Component {\n  _onKeyDown(e) {\n    this.setState({\n      inputValue: this.state.inputValue + \".\"\n    });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <input type=\"text\" onKeyDown={this_onKeyDown.bind(this)} value={this.state.inputValue} />\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe expected behavior would be the same but without console error. My component works exactly as i expect.\n\nReact v15.3.1\n",
