  "body": "I‚Äôve seen the ‚Äúrendered fewer hooks than expected‚Äù invariant a couple times now pointing at a component rendered as a part of an error boundary that just caught an error when that component does not use hooks at all.\r\n\r\nI‚Äôve been able to fix this issue by un-commenting:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/8af1f879299e88f9e370c1f01d90efaeefcefd27/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js#L372-L382\r\n\r\nI haven‚Äôt been able to produce a minimal test-case yet üò£. I‚Äôm reporting anyway with the temporary fix that worked for me in case you have any insight on what a minimal test-case could be. I‚Äôll update this issue if I keep running into the problem and I can create a minimal test-case.",
