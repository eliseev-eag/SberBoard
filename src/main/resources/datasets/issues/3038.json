  "body": "It would be nice if there were a way to call `forceUpdate` in a way that it would be applied recursively to children elements. I'm currently using `shouldComponentUpdate` paired with Immutable.js in a similar fashion to OM and I've found that this behavior can be preferable in some cases.\n\nOne concrete use case would be @gaearon's [hot loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) - which currently attempts to gather all of the elements and trigger a [`forceUpdate`](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-api/blob/426307049adc2f5107b84737fd7b5117abd97dc2/modules/deepForceUpdate.js#L10-L29) but it seems to still somehow be hitting `shouldComponentUpdate` in my application (haven't quite tracked down where/how).\n\nAnother use case would be as a simple solution to #2517 (the context / `shouldComponentUpdate` issue), when a context is changed you'd want to be able to `forceUpdate` on the element and all children.\n",
