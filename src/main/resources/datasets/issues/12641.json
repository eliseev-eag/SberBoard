Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nAn example can be seen here: https://github.com/MWGitHub/ssr-skeleton  \r\nPull down the repo `npm i`, `npm run dev` and go to `localhost:3000`.  \r\nThere should be a console log when the image is loaded.  \r\nThis does not occur in Chrome but you can see the log in Safari and Firefox.  \r\n\r\nChanging the file `src/ClientRoot.jsx` from `ReactDOM.hydrate` to `ReactDOM.render` causes img onLoad to trigger properly.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior is for onLoad to fire on images that are in the initial server side html.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nBrowsers: Chrome in OS X El Capitan\r\nReact versions: React 16.3.X, React 16.2\r\n\r\n",
