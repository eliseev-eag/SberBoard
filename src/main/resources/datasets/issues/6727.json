  "body": "Resolves #6723\n\nSo there's still work that needs to be done here, but I wanted to open the PR so I could get feedback early on. I have a couple questions:\n1. To polyfill `movementX`/`movementY` you need the previous mouse event's `screenX`/`screenY`. I implemented a `MouseMetrics` here similar to `ViewportMetrics`. Is that the right approach?\n\n1a. If `MouseMetrics` is an acceptable, is there a better place in the code path where I should register the new `previousScreen{X,Y}` values?\n1. I don't see any tests for `SyntheticMouseEvents`, am I just not seeing them or do they not exist? Where should I add tests for this?\n",
