  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nNeither, it is a question.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI was unable to locate where in the react-test-renderer source the tree is created.  The tree created by `create(...).toJSON()` will contain `attributeName={undefined}` on the generated HTML if an optional component property is omitted.  This was confusing to me since React will omit entirely (in the generated HTML), JSX Element attributes whose value is `undefined`.  I wanted to confirm that this was both expected behavior (I assume it is) and to understand why this was the case.  E.g., is it because it's an explicit test that the property is `undefined`?\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact: 16.2\r\nReact Test Renderer: 16.2\r\nBrowser/OS:  N/A\r\nWorked Previously:  N/A",
