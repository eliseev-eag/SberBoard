  "body": "Fix #808 was merged but reverted in 23ab30f. So SVG text cannot be changed in Chrome, for example (issue #807).\n\nAre there some internal tests relying on `innerText` behavior? It won't work on Firefox, so they should be fixed in any case?\n\ninnerText seems to return only visible text and little experimentation shows that it may invent formatting, such as `\\n` between stacked divs and `\\n\\n` after headings, so it may affect markup under testing, for example.\n",
