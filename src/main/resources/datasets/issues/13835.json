This will render a read-only field. If the field should be mutable use `defaultValue`. Otherwise, set either `onChange` or `readOnly`.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not always true. If your `onChange`-listener is further up the component tree, the warning is no longer true.\r\n\r\nThe same goes for checkboxes.\r\n\r\nHere's a reproduction: https://codesandbox.io/s/6wjl48mjn (open the console tab to see the warning)\r\n\r\nHere's the relevant piece of React source code: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/b87aabdfe1b7461e7331abb3601d9e6bb27544bc/packages/react-dom/src/shared/ReactControlledValuePropTypes.js#L41-L46\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIf possible, I'd love React to not show this warning if this is the issue. Or at the very least change the wording. The warning is great when you've actually forgotten to add an onChange handler, so we probably shouldn't remove it all together.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm passing a no-op onChange listener to silence the warning (yeah it's dev only, but I'm dev-ing all the time, and warnings are annoying), which probably isn't a great solution either.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nAll versions I've ever tried the last three years\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI'd love to work on this, but I'm not sure how to solve it.",
