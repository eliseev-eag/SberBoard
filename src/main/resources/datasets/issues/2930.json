  "body": "I originally did this work so that we could allow setState to be called\nbefore the public class had fully returned from its constructor. It's unlikely\nthat we'll go down that route now but this still seems like a better\nabstraction. It communicates that this is not immediately updating an\nobject oriented class. It's just a queue which a minor optimization.\nIt also avoids bloating the ReactCompositeComponent file.\n\nSince they both depend on the life cycle I break that out into a common\nshared dependency. In a follow up I'll refactor the life-cycle management.\n",
