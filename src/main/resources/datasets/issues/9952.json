  "body": "The tests only assert that the output of the tree is consistent after each action, and that the final result after all work has flushed is the expected value. It does not assert how work is reused, which means it can't detect starvation issues. However, this also means that it is fairly resilient to changes in our incremental algorithm.\r\n\r\nThe tests currently fail, which we would expect, given the known problems with the progressed work model.",
