  "body": "The package uses `peerDependencies` in package.json for [envify](https://github.com/hughsk/envify). Why not use `dependencies` instead? The adoption of `peerDependencies` is low and it's [being debated whether it should be kept in node](http://dailyjs.com/2014/04/16/node-roundup/).\n\n[browserify-cdn](https://github.com/jesusabdullah/browserify-cdn) is a tool which [requirebin](requirebin.com) uses. requirebin is a nifty tool for building modular examples and sharing them. I would like to use it with react, but browserify-cdn doesn't work well with peerDependencies. It would be extra work to make it work with them, and anyone building a similar tool might have to do the extra work as well. Because of this I would very much like node packages that are designed to be used client-side to not rely on peerDependencies.\n",
