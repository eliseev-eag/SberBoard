  "body": "I've being using version 16.2 till 2 hours ago, and when things were not what I expected I read [this](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html#when-to-use-derived-state) which made MUCH more sense than what I was doing so far... so I upgraded to 16.4.2, and things stopped working, mainly cause getDerivedStateFromProps is called after calling setState.\r\n\r\nis this a desired behaviour? I doubt it cause the props hasn't changed, and the entire goal of the method is to unify props pre-processing logic for new and updated component and unify the way developers apply the props to the state.\r\n\r\ni've checked 16.3.0, and 16.3.2, in these version setState does not trigger getDerivedStateFromProps.",
