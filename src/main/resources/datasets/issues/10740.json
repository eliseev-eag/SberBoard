  "body": "I wrote the [Redux FAQ](http://redux.js.org/docs/FAQ.html) last year, and it's been pretty helpful for answering actual frequently asked questions.  It'd be great if we could add a similar FAQ directly to the React docs.\r\n\r\nTim Arney already has a standalone \"React FAQ\" site at https://reactfaq.site/ that would be a great starting point for a lot of the material.  My [React/Redux links list](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links) is also a useful source of info in general.\r\n\r\nI'm opening this up as a place to discuss possible formatting for a React FAQ, as well as possible topics and volunteers to help write it.",
