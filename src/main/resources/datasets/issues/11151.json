  "body": "hey,\r\n\r\ni been using for Internationalize component that wrap my \"App\" component only to provide translation to the whole app like so:\r\n```\r\n<IntlProvider\r\n  locale={locale}\r\n  messages={messages}\r\n>\r\n  <App />\r\n</IntlProvider>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand inside \"IntlProvider\" i set my translation into context with getChildContext:\r\n```\r\ngetChildContext() {\r\n    const { locale, messages } = this.props;\r\n    return {\r\n      intl: {\r\n        messages,\r\n        locale\r\n      },\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then i could access it from anywhere from global context:\r\n```\r\nthis._reactInternalInstance._context.intl\r\n```\r\n\r\nis this global context was removed? haven't seen this change in the breaking changes.\r\nwrapping every component that use translations (99% of them do) with \"IntlProvider\" and use \"this.context\" instead sounds to me like overkill. \r\n\r\nthere is a better approach?",
