  "body": "This PR adds a warning whenever a user attempts to render an element unrecognized by the browser. \r\n\r\n**TODO**\r\n- Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test`).\r\n- Add specific tests for `validateDOMTag` much like `validateDOMNesting`\r\n\r\nThe tests for `ReactDOMComponent` include a lot of custom web components that will now show a warning because they haven't been defined before they were used. I'm not sure how to solve this issue yet. I'm hesitant to change the existing specs and, from an initial glance, it looks like jsdom doesn't fully support the web component `customElements` property yet. @spicyj Any ideas on how to go around resolving this?\r\n\r\nHere is a quick look at the warning:\r\n![screen shot 2016-11-23 at 08 30 05](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3777511/20570192/7f9b96c6-b157-11e6-9327-968d9a863f60.png)\r\n\r\n",
