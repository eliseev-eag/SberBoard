  "body": "_Note: this PR should make no changes to existing logic anywhere. Everything should continue to work as it does today. Also we don't expect to turn this flag of for the long foreseeable future._\r\n\r\nThis PR takes the existing event system call-sites and modules and wraps them in a `enablePluginEventSystem` flag. With this flag in place we can understand internally what parts of our application code use what events parts of the heritage event system. This flag also allows us to track metrics on code size of React Flare vs the heritage event system, as code size is important for us to manage.\r\n\r\nThis PR also renames the existing React Flare event flag to something more descriptive - `enableResponderEventSystem`.",
