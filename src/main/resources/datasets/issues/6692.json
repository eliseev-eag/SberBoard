  "body": "Anecdotally, it's my impression that most people aren't aware that string refs are considered legacy. The docs mention it, but it's easy to miss. As an example, I brought this up on Twitter and @ryanflorence (whom no one can accuse of being a React newbie) noted that he [hadn't bothered to look into callback refs yet](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/727252198678110208).\n\nThis PR places the legacy warning in a stylized \"Note\" box, like similar warnings throughout the docs.\n\n<img width=\"670\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-05-03 at 2 42 21 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3624098/14999315/5041e124-113d-11e6-8276-e7eddcffd25e.png\">\n\nIt might also be nice to link to a resource (perhaps a blog post?) that explains the disadvantages of string refs, but the only one I'm aware of is [this old GitHub issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1373).\n",
