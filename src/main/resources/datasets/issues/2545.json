  "body": "There was a common pattern to unmount a component by its instance:\n\n`React.unmountComponentAtNode(component.getDOMNode().parentNode);`\n\nNow components can return `null` from `render()`, and in that case getDOMNode() also returns `null`, and the code above doesn't always work. React internally always knows to which node the component is mounted, so please make this information accessible or add a component method like `unmount()`.\n\nMy project is in process of transition from Backbone views to React and we have a helper function `universalUnmount()` which gets Backbone.View instance of mounted component and removes it from DOM. So there is no way for now to make it work with any React component.\n",
