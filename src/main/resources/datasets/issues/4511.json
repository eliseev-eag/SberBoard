  "body": "I'm experiencing an unexpected error related to \"native\" DOM events created in an \"owner\" component and triggered by DOM elements rendered by \"owned\" components.  There's been a number of seemingly related issues, the closest being #3790 - but this might be a different edge case so I thought I'd create a new issue for it.\n### Reproduction\n\nI've tried to whittle this down as much as possible:\n(The JSFiddle is using 0.13.3, but I get the same error using 0.14.0-beta1)\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/dmininger/8rdqhnox/\n#### Steps\n1. Click \"Go to Two\"\n2. Click \"Go to One\"\n3. Click \"Go to Two\"\n\nThe second time component `Two` is rendered React throws `Invariant Violation: ReactMount: Two valid but unequal nodes with the same `data-reactid``\n#### Notes\n\nAs I was trying to narrow down the cause, I found that under the following scenarios **no** error will be thrown:\n1. An onClick prop with an empty function (`onClick: function(){}`) is added to the \"a\" element in component `One`. See https://jsfiddle.net/dmininger/kx98qfd2/\n2. The \"input\" element in component `Two` is removed (leaving the \"form\" element). See https://jsfiddle.net/dmininger/snjb8ysq/\n3. The return value of the render methods of components `One` and `Two` are inlined in the render method of the `Main` component  (i.e. everything is rendered by a single component). See https://jsfiddle.net/dmininger/3majxxL0/\n4. ONLY WHEN USING 0.14.0-beta1: The \"form\" element in component `Two` is removed (leaving the \"input\" element). (Sorry, no fiddle, is 0.14.0-beta1 on a CDN?) This still throws in 0.13.3.\n\nThanks!\n",
