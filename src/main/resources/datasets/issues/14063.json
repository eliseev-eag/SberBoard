This behaviour is only on portrait mode.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nThe site with the problem(the login page) can be found at [https://crm.panoro.ro](https://crm.panoro.ro)\r\nJSFiddle with the code: [https://jsfiddle.net/4u71ry9b/](https://jsfiddle.net/4u71ry9b/)\r\nFrom what I tested the JSFiddle works on the devices where the input on my page doesn't. But I don't do nothing differently than what is in the JSFiddle. Some devices works correctly, some not. Tested on Samsung Galaxy S9 and Huaweii P20 Pro and doesn't work, but on Samsung Galaxy Tab8 works.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe keyboard to show and stay in order to write data in the input.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\"react\": \"^16.6.0\",\r\n\"react-dom\": \"^16.6.0\",\r\n\"react-router\": \"^4.3.1\",\r\n\"react-router-dom\": \"^4.3.1\",\r\nChrome(on android): 70.0.3538.80(Samsung Galaxy S9, doesn't work), 69.0.3497.100 (Galaxy Tab8, works)",
