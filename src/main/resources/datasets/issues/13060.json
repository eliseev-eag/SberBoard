  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nI'm not sure. :)\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThe docs say that a functional component has the same behavior as [React.Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html)\r\nhttps://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#functional-and-class-components\r\nshouldn't they have the same behavior as [React.PureComponent](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent)?\r\n \r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI was under the impression that a functional component _already_ has the same behavior as [React.PureComponent](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent), if that is the case, then the docs should be updated, if that is not the case then one of two things should happen:\r\n- Functional components _should_ have the same behavior as [React.PureComponent](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent)\r\n- The docs should recommend using [React.PureComponent](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent) instead of functional components since the performance would be better.\r\n\r\nI suppose I do not understand how a functional component could **not** be _pure_, unless you were doing some sort of anti-pattern.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16+",
