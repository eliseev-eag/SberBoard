  "body": "Hi,\n\nI think it should be easier to try/use a beta version of React (like 0.14.0-beta2).\n### Lack of documentation\n\nAs the changes are not yet officially documented, it would be nice to have a github issue per beta where the community could discuss migration problems. Usually, the errors/warnings provided by React are quite explicit but a place to discuss this could also help, and give an insight of the amount of work needed to migrate before the attempt. \n### No JsFiddle\n\nI think it would be nice to provide a base JsFiddle integration for beta versions. It would permit users to test the new React behavior in a sandbox, but also to report bugs of the beta versions more easily.\n### peerDependency problem\n\nWhen using libs that declare React as a peerDependency, there is a problem with NPM because  `-betaX`  does not match any semver range (see https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/7330#issuecomment-73773970)\n\nThis forces the library author to use something like this, in order to be able to use a beta with the lib:\n\n`\"react\": \">=0.11.0 || 0.13.0-beta.1 || 0.13.0-rc1 || 0.13.0-rc2 || 0.14.0-beta1\"`\n\nThe problem is that on each beta published, the library authors all have to add the new beta here to support it. I mean as I'm using react-date-picker, I have to wait the lib author to allow explicitly beta2 before being able to test beta2 (or I have to use shrinkwrap or manually edit the package.json of the lib...)\n\nI don't know if there's a good solution to this problem, just wanted the React team to be aware of this\n",
