  "body": "I want to report a bug.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a var named opera with value null in window before loading react then react app crashes.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1) Create a new app using create-react-app my-app\r\n2) cd my-app && yarn start\r\n3) Add one line (<script>window.opera=null</script>) just before closing body tag into file public/index.html\r\n4) The app crashes here.\r\n\r\nCouldn't reproduce on jsfiddle.net. I think because problem appears if we execute window.opera=null BEFORE loading react.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior is to not crash.\r\n\r\nReact v16.2.0 and Google Chrome Version 63.0.3239.84 (Official Build) (64-bit). \r\nHave no info about problematic behavior with previous versions of React.\r\n",
