  "body": "i find my self not using `React.Children.only` because it's makes thing more complex and also it seems there are V8 [performance issues](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/wiki/Optimization-killers#2-unsupported-syntax) (if i got it right).\n\ni've found my self writing a component that need to react different if `children` is an array or a `react element` or an `undefined`. and using `try` & `catch` made things more complex for this issue. it would be nice if there will be a `React.Children.isOnly` that returns a `boolean`. but i seems to me that i'm missing something.\n",
