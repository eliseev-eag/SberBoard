  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n*feature*\r\n\r\nWill you consider extracting hooks logic from React?\r\n\r\nLoving hooks idea, so much, but I am not able to use it at my work since I am tightly bound to webcomponents ecosystem, and React does not play nicely with it, even if it did it will add on a bundle size and complexity of learning multiple component frameworks for my colleagues.\r\n\r\nLooking at libraries like [haunted](https://github.com/matthewp/haunted), which implements React after hooks version but with webcomponents and lit-html, there is a demand to implement it in other components frameworks or in  this case webcomponents.\r\n\r\nIf implementation will be extracted, there is a higher chance of hooks from user land to work across frameworks in same way and with less workarounds \r\n",
