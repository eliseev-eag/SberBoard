  "body": "I have a react component (A) which renders a component (B) which receives another component (C) as a one of its props, I need to update a props of the component B before rendering it. How can I do that?\n\nI tried to access to `setProps` but it's not available. Maybe I'm not doing it right.\n\nIn component A, I have something like this:\n\n```\nrender() {\n    var compC = <C something=\"smth\" />;\n    return (\n        <div>\n            <B propC={compC} />\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n```\n\nSo in B, I'd like to access compC and update its props. I tried to do that but `setProps` is not available: `this.props.propC.setProps(...)`\n\nI cannot move compC in B because it needs some other stuff from A that B doesn't need to know.\n",
