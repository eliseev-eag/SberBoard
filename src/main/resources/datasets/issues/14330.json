  "body": "I'm trying to remove fbjs from react-native. This is the corresponding change necessary in the React repo.\r\n\r\nI am unsure how to test this so I'm assuming that CI will tell me if something is wrong here. Also please tell me if the `invariant` entry in `package.json` shall go somewhere else. I'm assuming since this is synced to react-native for product uses that `invariant` as a dev dependency on the root is good enough for testing.",
