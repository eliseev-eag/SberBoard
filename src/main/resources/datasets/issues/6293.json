  "body": "We have been writing some tests around behaviour when required prop types are not supplied to a React component. We noticed that as we added `.isRequired` to more `PropTypes` some of our test suite did not break as expected. Our first tests check the number of times `console.warn` is called, which failed as this number would increase, but the following tests, that did not supply the newly required prop, did not trigger an increase. \n\nTo demonstrate the behaviour in a browser please see this [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/GordyD/wzqmodn1/9/).\n\nWe discovered the cause in [ReactElementValidator](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/0.14-stable/src/isomorphic/classic/element/ReactElementValidator.js#L214). It is actually suppressing repeat warning messages for missing propTypes. As you can see in the source, there is even a comment about this issue. \n\n> Only monitor this failure once because there tends to be a lot of the same error.\n\nFrom our perspective, this non-deterministic behaviour is unexpected and we would expect these warnings to appear any time we render a component without props which we have specified as being required, even if there tends to be a lot of them! We've discussed it as a team and we feel that the greater community may expect this type of behaviour too. \n\nAt this point we'd appreciate it if we could either:\n- get perspective on why this behaviour exists (we may be missing something that this protects against)\n- find a solution to patch this behaviour (remove suppression would be optimal in our eyes)\n\nThe relevant commit when this behaviour was added is [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/d0719a5ea4843cca40b0c1a73ad9acffd9639b50), quite a while ago now!\n",
