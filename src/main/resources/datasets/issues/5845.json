  "body": "> **My Target:** I am having a div which scrolls. But on coming to the top or the bottom after the scrolling the div, the scrolling starts happening on the entire page itself which I don't want. I think it's happening due to event propagation, so I am trying to stop in following manner.\n> \n> **My Implementation:** I am using \"extends Component (es6 way)\" to create my components. And I've put onWheel event listener as  \n> \n> ```\n> return (\n>   <div className='scroll-box-list' onWheel = {(e)=>{console.log('Scrolling Me..'); e.stopPropagation();}}>\n>       <OtherThings />\n>   </div>\n> );\n> ```\n> \n> It's consoling out 'Scrolling Me' fine but I am not able to stop propagating this event to the parent.\n> **Not sure why stopPropagation is not happening exactly or whether this issue is happening because of propagation**\n> \n> I don't want to use libraries which used mixins, so please don't suggest me this way.\n",
