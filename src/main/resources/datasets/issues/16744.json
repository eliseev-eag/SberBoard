Be able to upload a profiler run to react devtools for review later. Be able to trigger react devtools profiler programmatically. Be able to save a react devtools profiler run programmatically.\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact Devtools V4.",
