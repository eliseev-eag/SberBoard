  "body": "This adds an experimental focus grid API that creates three linked components:\r\n\r\n- Container\r\n- Row (goes in a container)\r\n- Cell (goes in a row)\r\n\r\nWhen keyboard arrows are pressed, the correct cell is automatically selected and its first focusable element is focused accordingly â€“ providing directional navigation through grid based interfaces. It can also be used on a list, where there is only one cell per row.\r\n\r\nI plan on adding up follow ups that validate they are nested in the correct orders. I also plan on adding Columns, which can take multiple Rows.",
