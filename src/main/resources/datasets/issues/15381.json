  "body": "This PR removes affects the experimental event API and its behaviour when server side rendering `TouchHitTarget`s. Specifically, it changes the rendering so that hit slop elements are no longer serialized in SSR output. Instead we rely the hydration logic for the `TouchHitTarget` to add in the hit slop element to the client. This change comes after internal discussions with @sebmarkbage and @necolas, where we agreed this was the right change for now; we can revisit this again in the future if needed.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes mouse events incorrectly firing before hydration has occurred. For example, if you have a `<button>` that had a `TouchHitTarget` on it, it would render with an inner absolutely positioned `<div>` that \"expanded\" the hit boundaries of its parent `<button>`. We then handle mouse and touch events in the event responders, allowing touch events to use the expanded boundary as intended and filtering out mouse events (as they shouldn't use the expanded boundaries). Unfortunately, as this logic of filtering only gets initialized upon hydration of a component, the incorrect behaviour happens with mouse events on SSR content before this fix.\r\n\r\nRef #15257",
