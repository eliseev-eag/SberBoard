  "body": "For those that don't know, [Google Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) is a transpiler from ES6+some extras proposed from ES7 to ES5. It's an active project and they plan to continue to implement other proposed JavaScript changes in the future.\n\nI think having a JSX transformation pass in Traceur would be a great win for two reasons:\n1.  JSX now has an [in-progress specification](http://facebook.github.io/jsx/), and is being recommended for inclusion in other transpilers. One of Traceur's goals is to experiment with new JavaScript proposals, so it seems natural for them to want JSX.\n2. Since JSX is a syntactical extension it is difficult to compose the JSX transpiler with other transpilers. It's cool that the current `jsx` tool implements some ES6 features, but AFAIK it doesn't implement the really hard hitting features like generators, and it definitely doesn't implement ES7 proposals like [async/await](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/wiki/LanguageFeatures#async-functions-experimental). If JSX is in Traceur, we know that we can play with whatever new features come out without having to drop the XML syntax (or vice versa). (P.S. from personal experience, async/await is SO awesome to use in conjunction with React)\n\nI suppose one blocker on this issue is the [status of the JSX proposal](https://github.com/facebook/jsx/issues). Anyone have an idea of how long it will take to stabilize?\n",
