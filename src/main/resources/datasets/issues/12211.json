  "body": "I've got a strange issue -- might be a bug in Firefox Quantum, not sure. I just tried upgrading from React 16.0.0 to 16.2.0 and noticed some pages give a flash of unstyled content now. It's an isomorphic app, but even with JS turned off I see the same thing. This only happens on pages that use the \"autoFocus\" attribute, and only in Firefox (version 58.0.2 for Mac).\r\n\r\nMaybe a React developer can give this scenario a try to see if they see anything strange?\r\n\r\n* Server side rendered template, with a regular stylesheet in the document head\r\n* React and ReactDOM version 16.2.0\r\n* Create page with `<input type=\"text\" autoFocus />`\r\n* Load it in latest Firefox 58.0.2\r\n\r\nIssue is not present in Chrome or Safari, and not present if I remove the autoFocus attributes.\r\n\r\ncc @gaearon Maybe something to do with autoFocus attribute changes recently?\r\n",
