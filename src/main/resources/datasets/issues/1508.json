  "body": "Intuitively it seems like this would be a performance win as we can bypass the run-time addition of `children` to `props` and also avoid an array allocation/population if there are multiple children.\n\nDoes it really matter in the end? I made a very crude test for the perf-suite, it `renderComponent` the same tree 100 times (exact tree below).\n\nDue to GCing kicking in often it's hard to provide any conclusive results. But after running the tests on IE11/Chrome many times I think I'm (imagining) seeing a consistent perf improvement of about ~1-3%. It seems like the graph is slightly less jaggy, but it could simply be a result of unrelated factors. So in large hierarchies (without `shouldComponentUpdate`) with lots of redundant descriptors it could probably provide a measurable but very minor improvement, but by and large it's probably safe to say it does not have a significant impact.\n\nThe downside to all of this is the produced code is not as neat and slightly bigger because of `children: []`, although the size should even out after GZ.\n\nI'm probably :-1: on this myself but thought I'd post it FYI if you see it differently. Also, perhaps you still want my \"addition\" to `ReactDescriptor` that improves it to always check the validity of `props.children` (in `__DEV__`).\n\n```\nReact.DOM.div({title: \"abc\", children: [\n  React.DOM.div({title: \"abc\", children: [\n    React.DOM.div({title: \"abc\", children: [\n      React.DOM.div({title: \"abc\", children: \"a\"}),\n      React.DOM.div({title: \"abc\", children: \"b\"}),\n      React.DOM.div({title: \"abc\", children: \"c\"})\n    ]}),\n    React.DOM.div({title: \"abc\"}),\n    React.DOM.div({title: \"abc\"})\n  ]}),\n  React.DOM.div({title: \"abc\"}),\n  React.DOM.div({title: \"abc\"})\n]})\n```\n",
