  "body": "This issue is intended to be a discussion for how to distribute the ReactFiberReconciler.js file and dependencies for custom renderers.\r\n\r\nCurrently first-class renderers within the React codebase/Facebook ecosystem do not have any concerns for this because of Haste / access to the React.js build + publish tooling within this codebase.\r\n\r\n3rd party renderers are currently adding `react-dom` to their dependency list and requiring `react-dom/lib/ReactFiberReconciler.js` to build and expose their custom renderer.\r\n\r\nIdeally, `ReactFiberReconciler.js` would be distributed with the `react` package or as a standalone `react-fiber-reconciler` package. Whether this is at `react/reconciler.js` or `react/lib/reconciler.js` idk. I think at the root is better to continue the discouragement of looking in `react/lib/*` for anything.\r\n\r\nI understand flat bundles are coming, too. I donâ€™t know if that should block this or if this could be a flat bundle, or any other alternative.\r\n\r\nIs this something the team is ready to commit to and support if we came to a decision on approach and I put together a PR?\r\n\r\n Related issues:\r\n\r\n* #6795 Create Separate Copies of Each Renderer\r\n* #5472 Include flow type definitions (flow type distribution proposal at https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5472#issuecomment-282394248)\r\n\r\n+ @sebmarkbage @spicyj ",
