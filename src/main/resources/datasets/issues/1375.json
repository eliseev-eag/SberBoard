  "body": "http://handjs.codeplex.com/\n\nStumbled across this a few days ago, MS is seemingly pushing for it to become a standard and looking at other solutions/implementations they seem to align. http://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/\n\nPractically it seems like a great thing to support, even if React doesn't provide a core polyfill. Simply adding support for the events so that users are free to polyfill themselves using a library of their choice seems like a great thing.\n\nI don't mind providing a PR (should be a simple matter) if you agree.\n",
