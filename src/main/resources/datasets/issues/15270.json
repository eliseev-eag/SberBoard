  "body": ">Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?\r\n\r\n**I want to report a Bug**\r\n\r\n>What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\n**When a component uses hooks and I try to render it with `renderToString()` it fails with this error:**\r\n```sh\r\nInvariant Violation: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons:\r\n1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM)\r\n2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks\r\n3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app\r\nSee https://fb.me/react-invalid-hook-call for tips about how to debug and fix this problem.\r\n# stack trace hidden #\r\n```\r\n\r\n> If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:\r\n\r\n**You can reproduce the problem by cloning this repo and executing the steps in the `README.md`: [https://github.com/anteloe/react-hooks-rendertostring](https://github.com/anteloe/react-hooks-rendertostring)**\r\n\r\n>What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\n**`renderToString` should behave equally for components with hooks as for those without**\r\n\r\n> Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?\r\n\r\n* \"react\": \"^16.8.6\",\r\n* \"react-dom\": \"^16.8.6\"\r\n* environment: node v10.13.0\r\n* OS: MacOS Mojave, Windows 10\r\n",
