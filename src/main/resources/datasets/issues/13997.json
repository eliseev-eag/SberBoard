  "body": "### Bug report\r\n\r\nWhen using React version 16.6.0, my app suddenly crashed with the error \"Cannot read property replace of null\". The exception happens when React tries to remove the string \"topsecret-\" from fiber.name. I tried to revert back to 16.5.2 to confirm the version where it happens, and it does indeed not happen in 16.5.2.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about steps to reproduce it, I've been using React 16.6.0 for a few days in this project without issues until now. Here's a screenshot of the exception and the file it happens in, along with the stack. Seems like a straightforward fix, so I hope a reproduction example isn't needed in this case.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/W3d7lmM.png)",
