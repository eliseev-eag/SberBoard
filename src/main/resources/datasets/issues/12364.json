  "body": "Hi, I just want to ask a question\r\n\r\nIm a Preact user, never tryed React, I only did a course a couple of months ago. But now I have to use React for a project and I'm trying to port one of my libraries: https://github.com/k1r0s/preact-bind-group\r\n\r\nThis library aims for easy form setup\r\n```jsx\r\n\r\n<FormGroup watch={change => this.setState({ ...change })}>\r\n      <div className=\"field\">\r\n         <label className=\"label\">Email</label>\r\n         <div className=\"control\">\r\n            <input data-bind=\"mail\" className=\"input\"/>\r\n         </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n     <div className=\"field\">\r\n      <label className=\"label\">Contrase√±a</label>\r\n      <div className=\"control\">\r\n         <input data-bind=\"pass\" type=\"password\" className=\"input\"/>\r\n     </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div>\r\n     <a onClick={_ => this.doLogin(this.state)} className=\"button is-primary\">Submit</a>\r\n  </div>\r\n</FormGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy code works perfecly on Preact but Im facing issues on React, for example input is loosing focus everytime I time on the form rather than update field value.\r\n\r\nThis is the React example: https://codesandbox.io/s/9jv6n8mnrp\r\n\r\nThis is the Preact which is working: https://codesandbox.io/s/wmpv1o4z8\r\n\r\nThis library keeps an internal state to manage field values and events.. what Im doing wrong? help appreciated\r\n\r\n",
