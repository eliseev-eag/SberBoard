But it's been taking type as an argument for a while now so we can use it.\r\n\r\nI don't actually care about duplication per se but it's easier to reuse this instead of having to remember to add this in both places. Note actually reading `propTypes` still diverges (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14159) and we'd need to decide on semantics before fixing it.\r\n",
