  "body": "The \"Warning: setState(...): Can only update a mounted or mounting component. This usually means you called setState() on an unmounted component. This is a no-op.\" warning contains no context of what component setState was run on.\n\nsetState can happen at any time and changes to another component can be the cause of an unmount that results in the setState happening when unmounted so it's hard to even link the most recent code chagne you made to what setState call is responsible.\n\nSimply including the `displayName` in the message like other warnings have should help devs at least a little in tracking down the source of this warning.\n",
