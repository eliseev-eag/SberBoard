  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nMaybe a feature?\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nCurrently the error Component Stack(i.e. `arguments[0]` of `componentDidCatch`) is something like:\r\n```\r\nin Foo\r\nin Connect(Foo)\r\nin Bar\r\nin div\r\nin ...\r\n```\r\nBut in production, they would be formatted to:\r\n```\r\nin t\r\nin Connect(t)\r\nin s\r\nin t\r\nin ...\r\n```\r\nThis is almost **useless for our debugging.**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI want to request a feature which allow us to define our **own** static **componentName field**, the reason why don't use `displayName` is that the `displayName` is used by react-devtools or others libs, if we use this static field for our components, **everyone** could see our components/project structure(maybe there is others potential risk) , that's not what we expect.\r\n\r\nSo, if react could support custom static **componentName field**, e.g. `myDisplayName`, then we could set `myDisplayName` field for our components and react-devtools **can't inspect this**. And react read `myDisplayName` field rather than `displayName` to get the component name and insert they into the error stack string and then call the `componentDidCatch`.\r\n\r\nI know that if we implement this, we **still** could get the components/project structure by using some libs like babel to decompile or just make react-devtools to support this field. But that increase the cost.\r\n",
