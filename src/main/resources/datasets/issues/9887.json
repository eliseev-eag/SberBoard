  "body": "I have not added tests since it's not observable via public API, but I verified it works with React DevTools as expected if I make the necessary changes there.\r\n\r\nThis lets us fix this feature: https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/issues/337. It also makes DevTools faster because we can confidently skip bailed trees, which is important since DevTools now traverses the complete tree.\r\n\r\nI added this both in development and production because it doesn’t seem expensive to me, and I would prefer this feature to behave consistently. Its current pitfalls are already bad enough that people don’t trust it. I’d rather not trade them for other pitfalls. We can completely disable this in the future if we add a PROFILE build, and PROD build becomes incompatible with DevTools because of advanced optimizations. But I’d rather not break it earlier.\r\n\r\nExample before (note how even bailed out AddTodo and other TodoItems are highlighted):\r\n\r\n![](https://d2ppvlu71ri8gs.cloudfront.net/items/1z3W2R0E1n2Q0X3B3h3r/Screen%20Recording%202017-06-07%20at%2005.26%20PM.gif?v=bea5092f)\r\n\r\nExample after (note how TodoList and one TodoItem are highlighted, others are skipped):\r\n\r\n![](https://d2ppvlu71ri8gs.cloudfront.net/items/3W3I312q273v2a461l0r/Screen%20Recording%202017-06-07%20at%2005.22%20PM.gif?v=aac71c5e)\r\n\r\n",
