  "body": "**Bug**\r\n\r\n**Current behavior:**\r\n\r\nI am attempting to load data from an API, display, and then scroll to a URL fragment deep in the document. Window only partially scrolls.\r\n\r\nThis may have more to do with browser behavior but I can't figure out how to reliably wait for content to be painted before scrolling it into view on the first attempt.\r\n\r\n**Here's an example showing the issue:**\r\n1. open a _new_ incognito (Chrome) or private (Firefox) window.\r\n2. paste (or type, sorry FF) this URL - https://jsbin.com/wifopagasu/edit?js,output\r\n- data will be loaded from iTunes and saved to state\r\n- `render` is triggered\r\n- `componentDidUpdate` is triggered\r\n- `window.requestAnimationFrame` is used to let DOM painting occur\r\n- DOM node deep in document is queried and attempted to scroll into view (correct node has a red background)\r\n\r\nI've never seen this work with a fresh incognito/private window.\r\n\r\n[Here's an issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/2659) where using `requestAnimationFrame` is suggested.\r\n[Here is a SO answer with discussion about this.](http://stackoverflow.com/a/28748160/184532)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nDOM node scrolled into view\r\n\r\n**Versions of React:** `15.1+`\r\n\r\n**Browsers / OS:** `Mac OS X 10.11.6`\r\n\r\n**Did not work with previous versions of React**\r\n",
