  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nbug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThis addresses a bug in `enzyme`, https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/issues/1683.\r\n\r\nOn [this line](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-test-renderer/src/ReactShallowRenderer.js#L110) `element.type()` invokes the SFC with `element` as the `this` value. I believe that this is needed for create-react-class components, but that there needs to be a separate branch for SFCs.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n`this` inside a strict-mode SFC will be `undefined`, not the element.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nIn all of React 0.13, 0.14, 15, and 16, this bug exists.\r\n\r\nWhile the bug ideally will be fixed, I understand that it's highly unlikely that it would be backported to the 14/15 lines - but I can wrap around it if there's a reliable way, in those versions, to distinguish SFCs from create-react-class components (is there?).",
