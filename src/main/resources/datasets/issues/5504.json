  "body": "Using profiling `hasOwnProperty` goes from 3.7% of ticks to 0.6% of ticks when calling `renderToStaticMarkup` 10,000 times. I made sure to only remove calls when the objects are internally created and managed and guaranteed to never have prototypes.\n\nI've also been thinking about optimizations for `props`. By ensuring that props are a prototype-free object early on in `React.createElement` a lot of the `hasOwnProperty` checks downstream could be optimized. I think this may get in to micro-optimization territory though since I'm only seeing 0.6% of ticks in `hasOwnProperty` at this point (although paths other than `renderToStaticMarkup` may have more usage like the reconciler).\n",
