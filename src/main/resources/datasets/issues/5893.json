  "body": "Hi,\n\njust migrated to react 0.14.6 and encounter this warning when switching to react.min.js\n\nsample i have component:\n\n```\nconst TestComponent = React.createClass({\n  getInitialState() {\n     return {\n        number: 1\n     }\n  },\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>Hello World</div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default TestComponent\n```\n\nwhen using react.min.js\ni receive:\n\n```\nWarning: getInitialState was defined on TestComponent, a plain JavaScript class. This is only supported for classes created using React.createClass. Did you mean to define a state property instead?\n```\n\nbut when using react.js there is no warning.\n\ni tried to refactor everything to:\n\n```\nstate: {\n  number: 1\n}\n```\n\nbut then my state becomes null\n\nthanks\n",
