  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nreport a bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen I call setState with a callback in a test using react shallow renderer (via enzyme), the callback gets called and `this.state` is still the old state.\r\n\r\nEDIT: This seems limited to componentWillMount\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template for React 16: https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/, template for React 15: https://jsfiddle.net/hmbg7e9w/).**\r\n\r\nEDIT: Reproduce with this https://github.com/bdwain/setstate-callback-bug\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nWhen the setState callback gets called, it should have access to the new state.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nVersion 16.\r\nIt worked in v15 with enzyme 2.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I think this is because in componentWillMount, [this line](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-test-renderer/src/ReactShallowRenderer.js#L67) causes the render method in the shallow wrapper to return early, before it updates the state.",
