  "body": "I was surprised (pleasantly so) to read that events bubble through portals and up the component tree rather than the DOM tree. Obviously this means I can detect clicks that occur within my component or child components without having to worry about whether they happen to be portal hosted.\r\n\r\nHowever, another fairly common thing you may want to do is detect whether an event occurred *outside* of a component or child components. There are plenty of libraries out there that do this, but they all (AFAIK) use the DOM tree so don't have this same behaviour. \r\n\r\nI was curious whether or not there is anything new, but unadvertised, in React 16 that can help with this part of the puzzle?",
