Subsequent fetches work this way.\r\nType two characters faster than results for the first character are rendered and fallback will never go although the second request is successful. \r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.

Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nreact: 16.7.0-alpha.0\r\nreact-dom: 16.7.0-alpha.0\r\nreact-cache: 2.0.0-alpha.0",
