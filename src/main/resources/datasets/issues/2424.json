  "body": "It would be great to have documentation for various versions of React similar to http://nodejs.org/docs/\n\nCurrently the docs points to the latest version and until our apps are upgraded it'll be nice to be able to refer to documentation for earlier versions.\n\nAlso I'm interested in helping move towards React powered docs and remove Jekyll dependency without disturbing the existing structure. Is the team willing to consider contributions in this area?\n\n@sebmarkbage @zpao\n",
