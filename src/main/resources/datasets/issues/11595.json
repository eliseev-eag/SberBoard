  "body": "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI was wondering if it makes sense, implement the React Tests for windows environment. Even if it's to test only the build task (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9540, https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9500) or only run for master branch. I was thinking of using the [appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/).\r\n\r\nMy other question is about migrate to Circle CI 2.0 configuration. **If any of this questions make sense**, I'll be available to implement it.",
