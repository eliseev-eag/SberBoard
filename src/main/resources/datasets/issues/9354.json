The first impression was important, so it was more appropriate to show the correct code firstly.\r\n\r\n**Before submitting a pull request,** please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.\r\n2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.\r\n4. Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test`).\r\n5. Make sure your code lints (`npm run lint`).\r\n6. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`npm run prettier`).\r\n7. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) typechecks (`npm run flow`).\r\n8. If you added or removed any tests, run `./scripts/fiber/record-tests` before submitting the pull request, and commit the resulting changes.\r\n9. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n",
