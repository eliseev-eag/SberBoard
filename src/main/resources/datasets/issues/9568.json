  "body": "I know [we've agreed](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9518#discussion_r113145331) that this should wait for React 16, but I've found a way (credits to @benjamn) to improve those checks so they produce smaller polyfill when bundled by webpack (only `global` - which is few lines of code, and not whole `process`).\r\n\r\nIf you agree on the change this commit should be cherry-picked into the `v15` line. Can also be merged into the master as precaution for now if somebody's using already `next`. \r\n\r\nI've confirmed that bundles are ok, tests are passing and this is in fact 'fixing' the whole auto-polyfill situation for webpack's users. If you decide its not a time for such fix, just close the PR :)\r\n\r\ncc @gaearon ",
