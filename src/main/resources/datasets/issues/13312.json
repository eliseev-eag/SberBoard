  "body": "It might not be obvious but by rendering a Generator you're asking React to perform a mutation during the render phase. This already doesn't work in development because we do key validation, thus consuming the generator. It led to some confusion: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11864, https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12995, https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11502, https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7536.\r\n\r\nLet's warn about this pattern right as we encounter it. The new warning shouldn't be noisy because the pattern is already broken in development (and as you can see in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12995#issuecomment-410010708, it's fragile in production).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to detect generators in browsers that don't support `toStringTag` but I figured warning in modern browsers is sufficient.",
