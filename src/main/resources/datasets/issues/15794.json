  "body": "WorkPhase is an enum that represents the currently executing phase of the React update -> render -> commit cycle. However, in practice, it's hard to use because different \"phases\" can be nested inside each other. For example, the commit phase can be nested inside the \"batched phase.\"\r\n\r\nThis replaces WorkPhase with a different concept: ExecutionContext. ExecutionContext is a bitmask instead of an enum. It represents a stack of React entry points. For example, when `batchedUpdates` is called from inside an effect, the ExecutionContext is `BatchedContext | CommitContext`.",
