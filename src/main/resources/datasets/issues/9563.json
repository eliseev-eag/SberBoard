  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nFeature?\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThere doesn't seem anyway to be able to access React's tree.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nSome way to be able to see how elements are nested with their parent-child relationship.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n15+\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is the right place to inquire about this sort of functionality/feature--if not, I'd appreciate it if you can point me in the right direction--but I have a need to be able to know how child nodes are associated with their parents and to be able to reference them...\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<CustomComponent>\r\n  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>\r\n\r\n  <CustomComponent>\r\n    <h1>One</h1>\r\n  </CustomComponent>\r\n\r\n  <CustomComponent>\r\n    <h1>Two</h1>\r\n\r\n    <CustomComponent>\r\n      <h1>Two One</h1>\r\n    </CustomComponent>\r\n\r\n    <CustomComponent>\r\n      <h1>Two Two</h1>\r\n    </CustomComponent>\r\n  </CustomComponent>\r\n\r\n</CustomComponent>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see above, there is an inherent tree structure to these components (composite or host) and I'd like to be able to know, at the very minimum, how `CustomComponent`s are nested throughout an entire React application.\r\n\r\nI tried a naive solution with the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<CustomComponent id=\"0\">\r\n  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>\r\n\r\n  <CustomComponent id=\"0:1\">\r\n    <h1>One</h1>\r\n  </CustomComponent>\r\n\r\n  <CustomComponent id=\"0:2\">\r\n    <h1>Two</h1>\r\n\r\n    <CustomComponent id=\"0:2:1\">\r\n      <h1>Two One</h1>\r\n    </CustomComponent>\r\n\r\n    <CustomComponent id=\"0:2:2\">\r\n      <h1>Two Two</h1>\r\n    </CustomComponent>\r\n  </CustomComponent>\r\n\r\n</CustomComponent>\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously this is not an optimal approach as the user would have to define the entire tree structure with `id`s and in addition, if the order in which these components mount into the DOM is not linear so it would be hard to reconstruct the tree and be able to perform logic on their relationship to one another.\r\n\r\nAny ideas on how to go about this? Thank you for your time and assistance.\r\n",
