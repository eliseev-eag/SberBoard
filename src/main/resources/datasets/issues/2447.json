  "body": "The performance tool seems like an incredibly helpful tool, but I'm having trouble figuring out which components in my app are causing trouble. Consider the screenshot below:\n\n![React.addons.Perf](http://cl.ly/image/2q2G1r2i1N0X/performance.png)\n\nMost of the items are listed as \"undefined\". Is there any way to name the components so they are listed by that name? `\"undefined > undefined\"` isn't very helpful. \n\nI couldn't seem to find anything about this in the [Performance Tools](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/perf.html) section of the documentation.\n",
