I'm able to do the approach in other components, but for my main <App> component, the context values are not available. The app is based on create-react-app, using Typescript.\r\n\r\n**NOTE: To toggle the functionality of the menu, please simulate screen sizes of a mobile device**\r\nPlease note the comments on useContext not working properly in App.tsx, and how I demonstrate the a working context in Header.tsx.\r\nHere's the working codesandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/4rl53m496x\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nExpect to be able to use the hook in App.tsx, the same way it's used in Header.tsx\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n```\r\n    \"typescript\": \"^3.3.3\"\r\n    \"react\": \"^16.8.2\",\r\n    \"react-dom\": \"^16.8.2\",\r\n    \"react-scripts\": \"^2.1.5\",\r\n    \"@types/react\": \"16.7.18\",\r\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"16.0.11\",\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n",
