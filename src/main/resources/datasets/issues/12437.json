However, if I remove everything related to `this.state.json` (in the constructor, the `return` or the `<Gmaps>` props, so lines 13, 26, 33 and change the props line 30 by something else), everything works fine and `console.log()`  actually returns the wanted value.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI expect to be able to get my value even though a state has been previously defined and is used\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nreact@16.2.0, Chrome 65. I don't know if this used to work before because I never had to use it until now.\r\n",
