Not sure if it is from React.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nUsing react 15.4.0 with Nashorn Engine on JDK 1.8.092. A request of 500 threads per second throws 2 errors saying\r\n\r\nError 1:\r\nError: Transaction.closeAll(): Cannot close transaction when none are open. @ /react-dom/~/fbjs/lib/invariant.js?:44\r\n\r\nError 2:\r\nError: Transaction.perform(...): Cannot initialize a transaction when there is already an outstanding transaction. @ /react-dom/~/fbjs/lib/invariant.js?:44\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\nI'm not sure if it is a bug!!. \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nOut of 500 requests(10 to 15 fails in Server Side Rendering).\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nTried with 15.4.0 & 15.5.0. It is basically a server ride rendering fails in multiple thread scenario from Java.\r\nI have attached the exception trace below.\r\n[Error-1.txt](https://github.com/facebook/react/files/945285/Error-1.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Error-2.txt](https://github.com/facebook/react/files/945286/Error-2.txt)\r\n\r\n.",
