  "body": "This creates a new `react-native-renderer` package which contains the React integration for React Native. (Although in reality the files live in the `react` package just like for `react-dom` because builds.)\n\nI moved the most core files over but I still want to see how we can further minimize the contract. The individual commits show the process.\n\nCurrently everything in `src/renderers/native/ReactNative/__mocks__/` have to required from the platform.\n\nThis also contains some patches to make this compatible with 15.0. As well as enabling spread properties.\n\nI still need to run further test in the React Native repo to ensure everything works as expected.\n\nWe might want to consider this as part of 15.0 to avoid publishing a 15.1 immediately after since we'd have to do a minor bump for this stuff.\n",
