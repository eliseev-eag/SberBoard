  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nbug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nOur tests are sporadically logging a warning `Warning: ReactDebugTool: debugID may not be empty.`. We fail any tests that log warnings, so this is causing flakiness.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce...**\r\nI'm unable to consistently reproduce, but we're seeing roughly a 2% failure rate for our test suite. Doesn't seem to be any patterns around which tests will fail with this error.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI'd expect our tests to either log a warning consistently if we're doing something wrong or to not log a warning at all.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n```\r\n❯ node --version; npm --version; npm ls react react-dom enzyme\r\nv6.10.2\r\n2.15.12\r\nAirbnb@1.0.0 /Users/gary_borton/airlab/repos/airbnb\r\n├── enzyme@2.8.0 \r\n├── react@15.4.2 \r\n├── react-dom@15.4.2 \r\n└─┬ react-router-dom@4.1.1\r\n  └── react@15.5.4 \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe appearance of this warning correlates pretty closely with our migration from node 4 to node 6.",
