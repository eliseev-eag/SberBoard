If there is a good explanation for this behavior I can dig further.\r\n\r\nThe symptom I was seeing is that if I flood the scheduler with enough low pri work, it would make a synchronous long chain of commits during expiration — sometimes locking up the thread for 20 seconds or so. I couldn't find a way to reproduce more than one extra commit in this test, but maybe this is enough to demonstrate the issue?",
