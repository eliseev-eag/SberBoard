  "body": "Hi all\n\n   I was hoping to retrieve a field's meta attribute after the field has been rendered so that I can know if a field has an error or not.  I'm actually wrapping a field in a pop up so that it can be edited later so I want to know whether the field has an error so that they use is allowed to continue.\n\nFor example,\n\n`let fieldReference = <Field name=\"name\" component={CustomComponent} />`\n`...code to be run later after the field has been rendered and user inputs value`\n`console.log (fieldReference.meta.error);`\n\nI'm finding that I cannot reference the meta object.  But I can access the meta object in in the CustomComponent field, is there anyway without storing my own variables to access the meta or input objects if I have a reference to the field?\n",
