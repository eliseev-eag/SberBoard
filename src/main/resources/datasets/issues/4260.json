  "body": "I was wondering if anyone could provide some insight about how to achieve an animated component/page switch with React.js.\n\nWhat i'd like to achieve is a component/page transition like the one on http://www.semplicelabs.com/ - a header that transitions opacity and margin-top and a content that transitions opacity.\n\nWhen a new component/page is shown, the currently shown component/page should transition out before the new component/page transitioning in.\n\nSome code to play around with:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/gonsfx/xva2g6oo/\n",
