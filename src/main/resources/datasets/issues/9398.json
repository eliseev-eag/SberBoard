Release new versions. (https://github.com/facebook/prop-types/pull/63)\r\n- [ ] <s>Why doesn’t TransitionGroup have a deprecation warning? Let’s add if we forgot it. Make sure the wording says “moved” since moving is all that happened.\r\n    - note: we should point to a specific version of the separate module, to make this future-proof against API changes to the transition group modules.</s> Fixed in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9937\r\n- [x] Update add-on versions in 15.6 and master branches. \r\n- [x] Fix https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9689 and https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9765 (fixed by https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9946 ?)\r\n- [x] Merge https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9638\r\n- [x] https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9766\r\n- [x] Release new versions of add-ons\r\n- [x] Cherry-pick all these changes into 15.6\r\n\r\n## Other related items:\r\n\r\n- [ ] <s>Document the process for deprecating an API in React</s> Moved to https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10057\r\n- [x] Can we remove junk code from PropTypes prod build? It doesn't use bundle-collapser so it ships all those method names (e.g. “fbjs/lib/invariant”). This is fixable if you add “-p bundle-collapser/plugin” to browserify call. Additionally, there seems to be some junk invariant() code which is easy to fix if we just turn this into an inlined error. https://unpkg.com/prop-types@15.5.6/prop-types.min.js\r\n- [x] Make sure deprecations are on master too\r\n\r\n## Follow-up issues:\r\n - <s>Find a solution for https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8575</s> (we did merge this after all)\r\n    - <s>Which unblocks adding the tests from https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/e29871e6bed28676815aaf9259d33a99520a10d8 which depend on 'inputValueTracking'</s>\r\n - Further improvements to React warnings in general, specifically to adress https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9466\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps we went through for React 15.6.0;\r\n\r\n## Preparing the RC:\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Done!
