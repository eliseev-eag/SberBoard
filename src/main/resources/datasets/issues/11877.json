In the codepen below when I accidentally type a period after some number the whole input gets cleared. This is somehow related to the parent component's state being updated because if the `defaultValue` prop is removed from the `<Input>` component the input doesn't get cleared.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template for React 16: https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/, template for React 15: https://jsfiddle.net/hmbg7e9w/).**\r\n\r\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/aEOgNL?editors=0010\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe input should retain its visible value even if it would be invalid (can't be converted to a number).\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.2.0 and Chrome 63 on macOS 10.12.6.\r\n\r\nTested in Safari 11.0.2 and typing a period kinda works. After typing the first number after the period it gets converted to a comma but the cursor jumps to the beginning.\r\n\r\nAlso tested in Firefox 57.0.1 but it seems to think that period is the correct decimal mark.",
