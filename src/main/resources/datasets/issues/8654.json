  "body": "Would be a micro optimization to appease the functional gods but the order of `ReactDOM.render`'s arguments  has always felt backwards to me. \r\n\r\nI should say **were** I want the app to render and **then what** I want to render. \r\n\r\nMight sound kind of useless at first but I actually have built something where I was rendering different components into the same div based on something that was happening outside of react. \r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { curry, flip } from 'ramda'\r\nconst mount = curry(flip(ReactDOM.render))\r\nconst render = mount(document.getElementById('content'))\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nif (otherFramework.tabIndex === 1) {\r\n   render(<Home />)\r\n} else if (otherFramework.tabIndex === 2) {\r\n   render(<About />)\r\n} else {\r\n   render(<FourOhFour />)\r\n}\r\n```",
