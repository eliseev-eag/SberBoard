  "body": "Text nodes can't have children. Flow didn't catch this for some reason, but it does in my WIP branch where I run Flow with more specific types.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't really change the behavior except getting rid of an unnecessary function call and a read from a DOM node. The issue is unobservable but it breaks typing in my future PR.\r\n\r\nYou can verify this used to happen in old code by applying\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n--- a/packages/react-dom/src/client/ReactDOMHostConfig.js\r\n+++ b/packages/react-dom/src/client/ReactDOMHostConfig.js\r\n@@ -419,6 +419,10 @@ const ReactDOMHostConfig = {\r\n     getFirstHydratableChild(\r\n       parentInstance: Container | Instance,\r\n     ): null | Instance | TextInstance {\r\n+      if (parentInstance instanceof Text) {\r\n+        throw new Error('nooo')\r\n+      }\r\n+\r\n```\r\n\r\nand running `yarn test`.
