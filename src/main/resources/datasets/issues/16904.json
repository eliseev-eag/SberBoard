  "body": "As a library author, I test against both the `@next` and `@latest` versions of `react` and `react-dom` (as well as 16.3, the oldest version we support). The rationale for that is to know up front if the upcoming version of React is going to break our library. I think this is good practice for everyone involved.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when 16.9 was released, there was only 1 week between promoting the RC to `@next`, and promoting that to `@latest`. Because the last RC broke the way `act` works, I had only 1 week to fix our unit test suite, which was all the sudden mostly failing. In fact we had to wait for `react-testing-library` to be updated to deal with this change.\r\n\r\nLuckily I was able to scramble and find time to fix this before the final release, but this won't always be the case. I imagine other library authors may struggle with this too. As such I would like to see at least a 2 week window between `next` and `latest`. I hope that's feasible.\r\n\r\nPlease advise if there's a better way to test for future compatibility.",
