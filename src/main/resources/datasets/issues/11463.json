  "body": "An alternative to https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11445.\r\nThis lets third party renderers inject themselves into the devtools.\r\n\r\nPreviously, renderers had to reach into reconciler directly to do this.\r\nHowever, this wouldn't work for third party renderers.\r\n\r\nInstead, I put `injectIntoDevTools()` directly on the `ReactFiberReconciler()` return value.\r\nThis way any renderer can choose to call it (or not call it).\r\n\r\nAlso moves us closer to not using cross-package `/src/` imports.",
