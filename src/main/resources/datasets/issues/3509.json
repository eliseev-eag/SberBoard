  "body": "Hello guys,\nreact 13 is really amazing but I think it has small inconvenience.\nIn es6 classes we've lost very pretty functionality: autobinding event callbacks to owner. I very struggle with this functionality because every solution that react recommends is awful. We really need to bind to this owner almost every event callback and there is no magic as it is written in react blog. Please return this feature in next release.\nThank you!\n",
