  "body": "**what is the change?:**\r\n-> Stores an id for each callback, removes it after callback is cancelled or called.\r\n-> We don't use 'Map' because this library is intended for use outside of React, don't want to add dependency on a polyfill if we can avoid it.\r\n-> We may eventually just use a linked list, but I still like the simplicity of being able to cancel the callback in O(1) time using some kind of key/value storage with the id.\r\n-> Since we have a callback, timeout, and id which are always used together, makes sense to store them in an object. Also once we store multiple callbacks will need to create objects to store these pieces of data for each. If we really want to avoid creating objects, could use arrays with data for a given callback at the same index, or we could use object pooling. Would explore that in a later PR, seems like a premature optimization though.\r\n    \r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nOnce we support multiple callbacks you will need to use the id to\r\nspecify which callback you mean.\r\n\r\nAlso storing the callback data in an object sets us up nicely for storing an array of pending callback configs.\r\n    \r\n**test plan:**\r\nAdded a new test for `cIC` and ran all tests.",
