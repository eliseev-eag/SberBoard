  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nFeature\n\n**Requested feature:**\nI am currently upgrading from React 0.14.7 to 15.1.0 and have noticed that our test suite is running considerably slower. In 0.14.7 it was running in about 4 minutes and with 15 it is running in about 15 minutes.\n\nI created a custom version of react-with-addons.min.js that does not remove `TestUtils` and `Perf` which brought the time down to about 3 minutes.\n\nMy request is to expose a react-with-addons file that is minified but also includes `TestUtils` and `Perf`. \n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\nReact 15.1.0, yes in React 0.14.7 our test suite was not slowed down.\n",
