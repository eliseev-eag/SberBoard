  "body": "Since Fiber is here - did you, as React team, even consider having render functions like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass UserInfo extends Component {\r\n  async render() {\r\n    const apiData = await fetchUser(this.props.userId);\r\n    return <div>{apiData.userName}</div>;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously, it's changing some core ways about how react is working.\r\n\r\nThere are few consequences about such approach:\r\n- every render needs to be promise. (it'd be back-compatible tho)\r\n- it'd require figuring out how loading state is shown up\r\n\r\n\r\nI imagine whole new way you could write apps that rely on async api's:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass UserInfo extends Component {\r\n  async render() {\r\n    const apiData = await fetchUser(this.props.userId);\r\n    return <div className={await fetchUserType()}>{apiData.userName}</div>;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about it?",
