  "body": "** This is both bug / feature\r\nhttps://www.x3dom.org/\r\n\r\nI used to be able to use x3dom with React. It was great.\r\n\r\n** React ^15 I was able to use the **is** property to generate custom elements and custom attributes that could be picked up by x3dom i.e. <shape is render=\"true\"/>\r\n\r\nNow with React16 i get many warning messages for all of the custom x3dom tag elements. Likewise it seems that certain attributes aren't getting rendered either. For instance if I do x3dom elements like so:\r\n\r\n`<fontstyle size=\"0.6\"/>` I'll get `<fontstyle/>` output without the size attribute.\r\n\r\nI don't think React should have to know what x3dom tags are, nor should they be hard-coded into React. There has got to be a way to have React output custom tags without throwing warning messsages. Why not just re-introduce the **is** attribute to indicate that it's a custom tag with custom attributes? ",
