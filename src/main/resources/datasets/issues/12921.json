Can you help me identify if there's a problem with my webpack in /lib or is this due to react-bootstrap/uncontrollable? Or just help me understand what is wrong here. I googled for two days, some people seem to have the same issue but no one received an answer or solution. I did npm ls react and it shows only one line, but im not sure if it takes into account the npm linked package.\r\n\r\nI believe this issue is related or at least similar https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12626",
