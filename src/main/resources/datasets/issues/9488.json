  "body": "**Note:** There are other PRs open to fix some failing tests and I expect to rebase on top of those and fix any remaining failures before landing. Hope folks can review this anyway in light of this.\r\n\r\nSome widely used libraries which depend on React have used syntax that\r\nends up passing non-standard props to default React components like\r\n'dom' and 'div'. For example:\r\n```\r\n  // where this.props contains attributes like 'foo'\r\n  return <div {...this.props} />;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince we started throwing warnings for this syntax in Reactv15.2 some\r\nlibraries have not upgraded past v15.2.\r\n\r\nNow, because of deprecations in 15.5, some libraries will only work with\r\nReactv15.5, and this causes a conflict when other libraries are pinned\r\nat v15.1. The overall effect is that either there are version conflicts\r\nor the \"unknown prop\" warning is thrown all over the place, and users of\r\nthese libraries can't fix the warnings.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9466 for more context.\r\n\r\nWe are deduping this warning in hopes that it allows more library\r\nauthors to update to the latest version of React. React v16.0 may take a\r\ndifferent approach to this issue. For some related discussion, see\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9477\r\n\r\n**Test Plan:**\r\n - Added a unit test\r\n - Manually tested with a fixture that was not committed; https://gist.github.com/flarnie/db011bf54206f30b9983cd4dc674c82e\r\n\r\n**Before submitting a pull request,** please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.\r\n2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.\r\n4. Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test`).\r\n5. Make sure your code lints (`npm run lint`).\r\n6. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`npm run prettier`).\r\n7. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) typechecks (`npm run flow`).\r\n8. If you added or removed any tests, run `./scripts/fiber/record-tests` before submitting the pull request, and commit the resulting changes.\r\n9. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n",
