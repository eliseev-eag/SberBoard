  "body": "I'm trying to clear my values of inputs with undefined values. I setup a demo page: https://codesandbox.io/s/n3v42mj50\r\n\r\nBasically if I set in render \r\n`const {txt1, txt2, txt3 = ''} = this.state.txts` the button clears input 3, but not if I don't put default value for txt3. I was searching through issues but didn't find similar issue. The use case is, that I have huge form and I have some predefined values. And once I update my form and try to reset it, these inputs are not cleared. Thanks for any help!",
