  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nI'm reporting a bug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen attaching an `onChange` handler to a JSX element, if calling this handler leads to the element being unmounted, then the `onChange` event never bubbles up in the DOM. This means you can't listen to it on the `document`, or basically on anything else than the element itself.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.**\r\n\r\nExample code here: https://codesandbox.io/s/qkr8j85z8j\r\nTry it out here: https://qkr8j85z8j.codesandbox.io\r\n\r\nOpen the console and click around a bit. You will notice that the single checkbox that never changes it's position triggers both `onClick` and `onChange` listeners whereas the other checkboxes that get moved between lists only trigger `onClick` events.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would expect the `onChange` event to be handled in the same way as the `onClick` event.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nTested under these conditions:\r\n- React 16.3.x and 16.4.x.\r\n- MacOS 10.13.6\r\n- Opera 54, Firefox Dev Edition 62, Chrome Canary 70\r\n\r\nBehaviour has not changed between versions.",
