  "body": "**feature/bug**\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nReact library logs either \"*Download the React DevTools for a better development experience: https://fb.me/react-devtools*\" or logs \"*Warning: The installed version of React DevTools is too old and will not work with the current version of React. Please update React DevTools. https://fb.me/react-devtools*\" if previous \"fix\" is employed.\r\n\r\n**reproduce**\r\nRun React site without production flag and without React DevTools extension installed.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nNo log output.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React**\r\n\r\nReact: 16.2.0\r\n\r\n**Tried**\r\nAccording to comment on #3877 the following should work in React >= 16.1.0.\r\n```\r\n      new webpack.DefinePlugin({\r\n        '__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__': '({ isDisabled: true })'\r\n      }),\r\n```\r\nHowever this changes the log to:\r\n\"Warning: The installed version of React DevTools is too old and will not work with the current version of React. Please update React DevTools. https://fb.me/react-devtools\"\r\n\r\nOther fixes such as those from StackOverflow yield the same results: https://stackoverflow.com/a/42196820.\r\n\r\nAlso the plugin itself doesn't work for me because of https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/issues/897. So installing it isn't an option, for me at least.\r\n\r\n**TLDR**\r\n\r\nI'm loving React. But logging the install note is a tad annoying. Previous fixes don't seem to work. So please provide an option to disable the log.\r\n",
