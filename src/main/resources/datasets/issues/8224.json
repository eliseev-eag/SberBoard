If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.\r\n4. Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test`).\r\n5. Make sure your code lints (`npm run lint`) - we've done our best to make sure these rules match our internal linting guidelines.\r\n6. If you haven't already, complete the [CLA](https://code.facebook.com/cla).\r\n\r\nIs it possible to be more clear here?\r\n This implies that we are removing the constructor from GAME, and not board (which is what I believe the author is trying to say).\r\nIt took me several reads to understand. \r\n\r\nWith this edit, it is now clear that the adjustment is being made to -Board- and not to -Game-",
