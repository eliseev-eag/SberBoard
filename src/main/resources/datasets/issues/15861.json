  "body": "Suspended nodes are hidden using an inline `display: none` style. We do this instead of removing the nodes from the DOM so that their state is preserved when they are shown again.\r\n\r\nInline styles have the greatest specificity, but they are superseded by `!important`. To prevent an external style from overriding React's, this commit changes the hidden style to `display: none !important`.\r\n\r\nMaYBE AnDREw sHOulD JusT LEArn Css\r\n\r\nI attempted to write a unit test using `getComputedStyle` but JSDOM doesn't respect `!important`. I think our existing tests are sufficient but if we were to decide we need something more robust, I would set up an e2e test.",
