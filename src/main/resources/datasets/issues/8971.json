  "body": "I've found what to me appears as a bug.\r\n\r\n## Bug\r\nWhen a controlled `input` element changes by updating it's value, `onChange` isn't called.\r\n\r\n## Reproduction\r\nI made a codepen that illustrates the problem; http://codepen.io/pudgereyem/live/bgmvOq\r\n\r\n## Expected behaviour\r\nI expect that `onChange` gets called, since the `<input/>` did change, and the world of React is by nature very much \"controlled\".\r\n\r\nThis is written in [the docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/dom-elements.html#onchange) and also mentioned in various threads such as https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8550#issuecomment-266248335 and https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8696#issuecomment-270909834.\r\n\r\n## My problem\r\nThe fact that the inputs `onChange` function not gets called is a problem to me, because I need to do logic (such as validation) when the inputs have changed.\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\n- I tried using `onInput` also, but it doesn't get called either",
