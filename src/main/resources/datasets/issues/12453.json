  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\n**Bug**, possibly\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe new `React.forwardRef` feature returns an object, not a function.\r\n\r\nTo this point, the `typeof` both stateless components and class components was `'function'`.\r\n\r\nReact does not expose a utility to check whether a given value is valid to be passed to `React.createElement`. As a result, third-party library authors who wish to pre-validate a component type will commonly use `typeof Component === 'function'` to test whether the type is valid. The return value of `forwardRef`, despite being a valid component type, will fail this naive test. Library authors do this in order to provide better errors than would otherwise be provided by React if an invalid component type was passed in.\r\n\r\nIn a perfect world, the fault would fall squarely on the third-party library developers for using an imprecise check, but those developers could rightfully point out that React has given them little ability to be precise in these pre-emptive checks.\r\n\r\n~This is one of those \"don't break the internet\" bugs.~ This is a bug where third-party developers have taken reasonable-yet-illegal dependencies on React internals in order to provide a better experience for their users. If it's not too difficult, it may be a good idea to chane `forwardRef` to return a `'function'`, instead of an object.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.3.0-alpha.3",
