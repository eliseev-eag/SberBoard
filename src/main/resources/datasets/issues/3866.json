  "body": "The new folder structure is organized around major packages that are expected to ship separately in some form.\n\n`/isomorphic`\n\nI moved classic/modern and children utils into a directory called \"isomorphic\" with the main export being ReactIsomorphic. This will eventually become the \"react\" package.\n\nThis includes all the dependencies that you might need to create a component without dependencies on the renderer/reconciler.\n\nThe rest moves into decoupled renderers.\n\n`/renderers/dom/client` - This is the main renderer for DOM.\n\n`/renderers/dom/server` - This is the server-side renderer for HTML strings.\n\n`/addons` and `/test` - Same as before for now.\n\nYou're not supposed to take on a dependency inside another package.\n\nShared code is organized into a \"shared\" directory which is intended to support all the packages in that subdirectory. Meaning that once we swap to CommonJS modules, the only time you should use `..` is to target `../shared/` or `../../shared`.\n\nE.g. `/shared/` is common utils that are used by everything.\n\n`/renderers/shared/` is code that is shared by all renderers, such as the main reconciliation algorithm.\n\nShared code will likely be copied into each package rather than referenced. This allow us to have separate state and allow inlining and deadcode elimination.\n",
