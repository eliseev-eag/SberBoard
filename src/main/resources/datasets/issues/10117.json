  "body": "This feels like a bug.\r\n\r\nI had a faulty code - trying to bind undefined function (I forgot to pass it down from parent). However there was no `Cannot read propery bind of undefined` error thrown and no `console errors` as well. It took me a while to figure out what the problem was. \r\n\r\nFor the past 30 minutes I have tried reproducing the error with different data, without any luck. I even copied the minimal amount of source files into another project and the error was thrown. I don't know what else to do. If you want to investigate: I setup this [branch](https://github.com/teamNOne/showdown/tree/react-bug-report). The described behavior can be observed in home / root. I cannot provide more information, since I don't have any. I really spent some time trying to replicate it, but to no success.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior would be throwing an error, obviously.\r\n\r\nI have no idea about previous versions of React, because I only now encounter it. I haven't updated React in the meantime. Version is 15.6.1, as shown in `package.json`. I am using latest Chrome and Windows 10.\r\n\r\n",
