  "body": "This could really use extra code review attention since the history of\r\nthese changes was a bit convoluted to follow.\r\n\r\nAfter talking to @bvaughn and @acdlite, we thought it might make sense\r\nto put the 'add-ons' changes in a separate change log. The other option,\r\nof including them in the main React change log, seemed the more\r\nconfusing of the two.\r\n\r\nAlso this commit is related to and somewhat blocked by\r\nhttps://github.com/reactjs/prop-types/pull/40\r\n\r\nAlso - I will update the release tags after we land some version of a changelog.\r\n\r\n**what is the change?:**\r\nAdding the change log for recent patch versions of React.\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nWe missed this step in the flurry of releasing patches, and it's useful\r\nfor folks who want info about what version to use.\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nVisual inspection of the change log.\r\n\r\n**issue:**\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9443",
