  "body": "<!--\r\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\r\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nReport a bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen the rows of a table with a collapsed `border` are re-ordered through a `setState`,  a border glitch is caused in some of the `<td>` elements of a table.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nLive example: [https://codesandbox.io/s/vjn3n7qm65?moduleview=1](https://codesandbox.io/s/vjn3n7qm65?moduleview=1)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to reproduce this bug one must create a table with more than 1 rows of data. The `<table>` must have the CSS style `border-collapse: collapse`, as well as a big border (for example `border: 10px solid red)`. Each table row must have a unique `key` (in order not to be re-created by React on subsequent renders)\r\n\r\nThe initial mount of the table gives the table elements a height based on their content without any border. When a re-order of the rows occurs (through a React state update), some of the `<td>` elements of the first row get a border as well.\r\n\r\nThis is can be \"fixed\" by either:\r\n  \r\n   * Removing the border from the `<table>` element or removing its `border-collapse: collapse`.\r\n\r\n   * Removing the keys from the rows (causing new instances to be created in the DOM by React)\r\n\r\nThe only reason I'm submitting this as a React issue is the fact that by removing the `key` attribute of React, this behaviour is no longer encountered. Please close it if it's unrelated with React.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe height & border of the the table rows should be the same as when mounted\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nUsing the latest create-react-app (React v16.6.3 & ReactDOM 16.6.3)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
