  "body": "[This example](https://codesandbox.io/s/1zn2o513pq) presents a huge performance drop between React 16.2 and React 16.3.\r\n\r\nIn investigated it and noticed several things:\r\n\r\n- Perfomance drop is only visible using development bundle\r\n- This is not related to styled-components (a simple div presents the same problem)\r\n- I tried to investigate in performance tab of Chrome dev tools and I noticed that I get React measures even without \"?react_perf\"\r\n- React Tree Reconciliation seems very long, do not know why\r\n\r\nIt is not a big problem for me, but it looks weird, so I decided to [share it on Twitter](https://twitter.com/neoziro/status/979756579296817154),  then @gaearon [invited me to submit an issue about it](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/980036013518139398).\r\n\r\n",
