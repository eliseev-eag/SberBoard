No warning. After reading about the term, I do think it's \"controlled\" in my case. I just don't want to put handler 100 times if I have 100 inputs. What's the reason to treat it as uncontrolled in this case?\r\n\r\nIt should be up to developer how to control the input, instead of such a 'if-you-do-not-follow-the-new-term-we-invent-you-can-not-type-in-silent' way. If he/she really forgets to put a handler, then it's his/her fault. Put a handler on parent is not our fault. Don't want to be punished for that.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIf there's a handler (no matter it's onInput or onChange or onKeydown) on the ancestor of the input element, it should be considered as controlled.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n15.4.2",
