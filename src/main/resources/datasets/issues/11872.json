  "body": "I couldn't get `flow gen-flow-files` to extract all the types. Ended up manually putting together some of the types from `ReactFiberReconciler.js`. How can I make this better?\r\n\r\nAlso, if there's no way to do this via flow or any other tool and are forced to maintain it separately I was wondering if we could test these types like `flow-typed` currently does - use [flow-typed's custom eslint rules](https://github.com/jeffmo/eslint-plugin-flow-typed/) and write a test reconciler (both passing and failing types) just like how flow-typed expects lib authors to write tests.",
