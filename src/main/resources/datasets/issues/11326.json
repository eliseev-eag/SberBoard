However I do miss the perf tool from previous versions and could not find any issue tracking a re-implementation of such a tool.\r\n\r\nWhat was great in the perf tool that is not covered as well with timeline integration?\r\n - Easily see which components render needlessly and therefore should be easily eliminated with sCU (and what impact it will give)\r\n - Easily see the collective render time of a component. I might for example have a component that renders very fast but which have very many instances and thus contribute to a significant render time anyway.\r\n - Give an overview of which components are slow by themselves and which are fast by themselves but render slow components. The flamegraph shows this, but I find it to specific in some scenarios with too much detail that can distract.\r\n\r\nBasically the wasted, exclusive and inclusive tables. The DOM table I feel is much better represented by the timeline integration.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16, yes the perf addon in 15 was good.",
