  "body": "In React  0.14x and below inserted dom nodes inserted by plugins such as adblock, browser sync, or otherwise were ignored.\n\nNow in React 15 these new nodes cause the\n\n``` console\nindex.js:65 Invariant Violation: You're trying to render a component to the document using server rendering but the checksum was invalid. This usually means you rendered a different component type or props on the client from the one on the server, or your render() methods are impure. React cannot handle this case due to cross-browser quirks by rendering at the document root. You should look for environment dependent code in your components and ensure the props are the same client and server side:\n```\n\nI'd say this is a regression since it breaks (full page) isomorphic rendering for anyone using plugins (or scripts) that insert dom when loaded.\n\nI'd say react should just ignore anything without a \"data-reactid\" when mounting server rendered code.\n\n---\n\nEdit:\n\nOn top of this React now throws in this case, where as before it would gracefully continue.\n",
