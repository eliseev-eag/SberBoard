  "body": "For now functional components are able to return string or jsx. It would be awesome to have support of native HTMLElement instances as well. \r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction SuperFastCustomComponent () {\r\n  const el = document.createElement('div');\r\n  ...\r\n  return el;\r\n}\r\n// Throws error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: [object HTMLDivElement]).\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nJust insert provided element in DOM.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nLatest\r\n\r\n**Motivation**\r\nFor some applications it needs to make UI as fast as possible. Especially it is critical on huge application with thousands elements which updates several times per second.  Virtual DOM in React provides good help for performance issues, but sometimes you need to go further and operate on level of vanilla js with incremental changes and custom virtual DOM model relevant to your application. For now the only way to do it is to use refs, but it is looks kind of ugly. Allow to return HTML elements will helps to solve this issue in elegant and intuitive way.",
