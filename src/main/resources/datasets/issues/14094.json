After few increments, the counter is struck and would not update anymore.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nThe bug is reproduced here: https://codepen.io/vank0/pen/yQyqNV?editors=0010\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI expect the counter to increment continuously without getting stuck after 10 increments.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16.7-Alpha , Chrome 70 on Windows 10\r\n",
