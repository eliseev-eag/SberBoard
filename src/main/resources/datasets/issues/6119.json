  "body": "Now that #1510 has landed we still have one final issue to fix (ironically, the initial reason for #1510). https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/1510#issuecomment-170229012 + https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/1510#issuecomment-170229162, the problem being that `value` is managed as a property for the purpose of `<input>`, but `<progress>` requires it to be an attribute so that the attribute is correctly removed when null.\n\nAs discussed in the second comment, it seems to me that the right approach here is to actually remove all the special property logic from DOMPropertyOperations and instead implement it in the appropriate wrappers instead (ReactDOMInput, etc).\n\nRepro: http://jsfiddle.net/670u7ure/8/\nOriginal issue: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1431\n\ncc @jimfb, @spicyj\n",
