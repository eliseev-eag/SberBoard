  "body": "https://codesandbox.io/s/40j50607y0\r\n\r\nRendering a component like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Foo = () => <React.Fragment />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThrows the error:\r\n\r\n> Foo(...): Nothing was returned from render. This usually means a return statement is missing. Or, to render nothing, return null.\r\n\r\nThe error is confusing because clearly `Foo` _is_ returning a value. I don't know if we want to support rendering empty fragments, but in any case this error is confusing.\r\n\r\nIf this isn't allowed it should explicitly call out that a component cannot return a fragment with no children.\r\n\r\ncc @gaearon ",
