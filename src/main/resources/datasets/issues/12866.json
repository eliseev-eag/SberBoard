  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nReport a bug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\n__Description__: I have done a small util to lazy load components. The approach is to store the lazy-component in the state and import it in the componentDidMount callback triggering a re-render. A simplified example can be seen here: https://github.com/isidrok/react-bug/blob/master/index.js.\r\n\r\n__Problem__: When the lazy-component is loaded and the component is updated new children are being set as text instead of children, resulting in [Object object].\r\n\r\n__Remarks__: This behaviour is different depending on the React version and the build tool:\r\n* `React 16.0.0` with `any build tool`: works.\r\n* `React 16.3.2` with `create-react-app`: works.\r\n* `React 16.3.2` with `rollup` and __NODE_ENV === \"production\"__: works.\r\n* `React 16.3.2` with `rollup` and __NODE_ENV === \"development\"__: __fails__.\r\n\r\nTherefore I assume there is  something different in how `create-react-app` and `rollup` handle environment variables replacement but the thing is it works totally fine if using `React 16.0.0` so that's why I think this is a bug.\r\n\r\n__Steps to reproduce__:\r\n1. Download the sample repository https://github.com/isidrok/react-bug.\r\n2. Install the dependencies `npm i`.\r\n3. Run `npm start` to build the app, and `npm run serve` to start an http server in `localhost:8080`.\r\n4. Go into the `index.html` file, there you can choose wich version of the app to load `build.dev.js`(fails) or `build.prod.js`(works).\r\n5. Go into the file `index.js`, in the render method of component `App` you can choose to render the `Wrapper` or `LazyHello`. Rendering `LazyHello` will result in _Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node': The node to be removed is not a child of this node._\r\n5. Navigate to the page and click on `Click me!`.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIt should render the lazy-loaded component independently of the tool used for building the app or the `NODE_ENV` environment variable value. Moreover, it should keep working since it did in previous versions of React.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n* This issue affectes version 16.3.2 of React, but it doesn't affect previous versions such as 16.0.0\r\n* Browser: Google Chrome 66.0.3359.181 (Official Build)Â (64-bit)\r\n* OS: Linux mint 18\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
