Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nI have a codesandbox here https://codesandbox.io/s/l71w795xnq\r\n\r\nHello2 Component has the ref implementation, the Hello Component was based on State (which is working). It was used on behalf of a question on Hashnode regarding this behavior.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nonClick event fires after enabling the button\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact Version is 16.3.2 in the sandbox, I do not know which version the questioner had, I'll share this issue with him. It also didnâ€™t work with refs created by callback or string. \r\n",
