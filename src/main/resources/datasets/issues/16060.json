  "body": "The current implementation of the babel plugin would move any `use*` to the hook signature, except the \"builtin\" hooks.\r\nThat could lead to a false positive, when something, which _ducks_ like hook could not be used in the signature.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Component = ({useTheForce}) => {\r\n  const useInnerHook = () => {useTheForce();};\r\n\r\n  useInnerHook();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nCheck that variable is reachable from the `signature` scope. That would not let track the \"real\" hook composition, but, at least, would not lead to runtime error.",
