  "body": "Hi!\n\nThis is not a issue in itself more a question I guess.\n\nI found the [turbo-react](https://turbo-react.herokuapp.com/) project that instead of binding json to a template sends html directly and use react to diff and update the body tag.\n\nI love the idea of going back to the root of the web and only use javascript for progressive enhancement as it was made to do (I think).\n\nI created a todo app based on the [todomvc](http://todomvc.com/) guides named [reactize-todo](https://reactize-todo.herokuapp.com/) that use the reactize.js made by @ssorallen. \n\nThe things I struggle with is that the controlled components in react makes my have to fiddle alot with creating react Classes and what not, instead of only diff the html in the page with the replacing html. So my question is, can the controlled components be made uncontrolled to make them acts as they do in pure html forms?\n\nOr are there other diffing libraries that do only this?\n\nBR Morgan\n",
