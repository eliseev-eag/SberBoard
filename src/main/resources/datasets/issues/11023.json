  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n*Feature*\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIn Firefox the `dialog` element is not implemented. We use a polyfill to be able to support it. Everything works well. But React warns that the `dialog` element is unrecognized, and this on each page load, which is quite useless (for this specific case).\r\nI would like the possibility to disable the  warning but only for some elements. So the utility of this warning remains when the developer mistype the component name.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nOnce we specified which tag are \"accepted/normal\" React will not warn on specified unrecognized tags.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16\r\nFirefox 57\r\n\r\nIn previous versions there was no warning.\r\n\r\nIs this clear enough? Do you need any other information?\r\nCheers",
