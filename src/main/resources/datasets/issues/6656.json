  "body": "This is mostly a prereq of #6655.\n\nGoals:\n- align build tooling (right now mixing grunt & gulp - commit, probably to gulp #4927)\n- add watching, should be fast to rebuild and test changes in browser\n  - could be something like webpack hot reloading\n- move shared tooling back into fbjs (babel plugin, custom lint rule)\n\nNon-goals but things to keep in mind:\n- alternate build approaches, in particular flat bundling - it needs to be easy to swap this in\n- releasing from master - we may want to have development happen such that feature flags are used to turn on/off features. we may want the build result to be a static flag set (no runtime checks) but would need to be possible to target any flag combination easily\n",
