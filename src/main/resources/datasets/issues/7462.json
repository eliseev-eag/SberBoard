  "body": "Hi. I have read alot of warnings about dangerouslySetInnerHTML api but what react can suggest instead? on official page https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-gotchas.html there are examples with simple strings like <div>First &middot; Second</div> . But i don't know how to implement this methods on such wide spread cases like displaying text with inner markup from database like \n`<p><span>text0</span></p>` \nor even more complicated. In my case this is a text created from  tinyMCE editor. How can i display it properly without dangerouslySetInnerHTML ?\np.s. i saw different plugins like htmlparser2 or similar but they are not much popular (stars count is less then 100)\n",
