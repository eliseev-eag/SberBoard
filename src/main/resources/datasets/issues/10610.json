  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug (ambiguous documentation) as well as feature (documentation update request)\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nCurrently the documentation for [PureComponent](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-api.html#react.purecomponent) says:\r\n\r\n> React.PureComponent is exactly like React.Component but implements shouldComponentUpdate() with a shallow prop and state comparison.\r\n\r\nThen the Note states:\r\n\r\n> Furthermore, React.PureComponent's shouldComponentUpdate() skips prop updates for the whole component subtree. Make sure all the children components are also \"pure\".\r\n\r\n\r\n- The question is _In what circumstances does it skip the prop updates for the whole component subtree?_\r\n- Does it also implicitly say that if I implement `shouldComponentUpdate` in a `Component`, the behaviour will be different? For example if it returns `false`, the props propagation won't be stopped?\r\n- A word on _Why make sure all children componetns are also \"pure\"_ would be handy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the documentation for [Component's shouldComponentUpdate](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html#shouldcomponentupdate) says:\r\n\r\n> The default behavior is to re-render on every state change...\r\n- _and props?_\r\n\r\n> Returning false does not prevent child components from re-rendering when their state changes.\r\n- But prevents prop propagation, that effectively stops the re-render cycle of all child components?\r\n- This sentence sounds like the two events may be related, but are implemented in a way to not prevent the re-render. Rewording to something like \"If a component's state is changed (or `setState()` is called), its re-render cycle will be initiated regardless of some parrental's SCU returning false in some point in past.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n**Do I understand correctly...?**\r\n- Component can re-render when it receives new props from parent component.\r\n- Component can also re-render if its state gets changed.\r\n  - Component can change its state when it receives new props or by calling `setState()` from outside or by the component itself.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nExpected is to find more explicit documentation. Currently some sentences look like they only apply for `PureComponent` or `Component` or both.\r\n\r\nExpected is to find an explicit mention that the behaviour of `Component` and `PureComponent` is exactly the same if their `SCU` happen to return `false`.\r\n\r\nOther articles about react components found on the web then reformulate these official rules in a way that further extends the ambiguity.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nv15.6.1\r\nhttps://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-api.html#react.purecomponent\r\nhttps://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html#shouldcomponentupdate",
