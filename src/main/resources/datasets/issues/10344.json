  "body": "Working through https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10229, I noticed that `onchange` was coming through as markup in the server-side rendering tests. This is because `ReactPartialRenderer` uses a `registrationNameModules` check to see if a prop is an event name. \r\n\r\nI believe `registrationNameModules` is populated by event plugins, which were removed in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10173. So this condition always resolves to true. I've confirmed by running test coverage:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"632\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-08-01 at 7 09 57 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/590904/28851057-28765c70-76ee-11e7-96c4-2cd97893ea04.png\">\r\n\r\nIf we remove the attribute whitelist, we need an answer here for event names on server-side rendering. I've added that to my list in #10229 ",
