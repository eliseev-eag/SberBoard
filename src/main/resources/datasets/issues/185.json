  "body": "The ease of starting from existing / mock html is a great feature of JSX. However, there are a few cases where the html attribute is not exactly the same as the DOM property name. The one that caught me was:\n\n```\n<td colspan=\"6\">...</td>\n```\n\nWhile this does not raise an error, the colspan attribute is silently ignored. The property name must be used instead:\n\n```\n<td colSpan=\"6\">...</td>\n```\n\nThis is somewhat related to #181 though as a JSX user I'd be happy for the name normalization to happen at transform time as it's the cutting and pasting in html use case that's important to me.\n\nReact.DOM does have the reverse mapping from property name -> attribute name, `DOMAttributeNames` in DefaultDOMPropertyConfig.js.\n",
