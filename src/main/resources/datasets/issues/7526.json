  "body": "I took where @philipshurpik left off with https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6940 to fix https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1919, as that PR can't be merged anymore and is more than a month old.\n\n@philipshurpik, if you meant to keep on working on https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6940, please let me know and I'll close this one.\n\nThe idea is to return a `PropTypeError` whenever one of `ReactPropTypes` is passed to `ReactPropTypes.oneOf`. The error message, hints that the user might be meaning to use `ReactPropTypes.oneOfType` instead.\n\n1) If `createChainableTypeChecker` is called with an `expectedType` we add the `expectedType` flag to the `checkType` function (see [1])\n2) In `createEnumTypeChecker.validate`, if `expectedValues[i]` is of type `function` and it has the `expectedType` flag, we know that a `ReactPropTypes` has been passed, so we throw the error described above\n3) As per https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6940, if a generic `function` is passed to `ReactPropTypes.oneOf` we improve the previous output to display \"Unexpected function\" and the function converted to string\n\nAs a side note, I noticed that if `getPropType` is called with `undefined`, we get the following exception:\n`Cannot read property '@@toStringTag' of undefined`\nIs this expected?\n\n[1] https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6940/files#r68511156\n",
