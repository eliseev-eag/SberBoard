I tried the [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/n98wxj99p) and [Snack Expo](https://snack.expo.io/SkdktSHhz) and both are working just fine. This is happening in my React Native app running on my Android phone. Only thing I've got is this screenshot from the debugger.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1096340/38962135-2532816a-436c-11e8-8bd7-c05c8a9338c2.png)\r\n\r\nStrangely enough if that code on line `8439` would read `providerFiber.type._context` then it would have been working correctly. Any chance there is a typo? :)\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nexport const rootContext = React.createContext<TRootModel>()\r\nexport const RootProvider = rootContext.Provider\r\n\r\nexport const App = () => (\r\n  <RootProvider value={RootModel.create()}>\r\n    <Text>OK</Text>\r\n  </RootProvider>\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n * react: 16.3.2\r\n * react-native: 0.54.2\r\n * Windows 10 x64\r\n",
