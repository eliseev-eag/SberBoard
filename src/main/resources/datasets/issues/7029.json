  "body": "Right now you can only dispatch native events to the DOM nodes, but there's not any way to dispatch synthetic events on the Virtual DOM nodes.\n\nI'd like to be able to dispatch synthetic events, in addition, I'd like a way to define custom event listeners.\n## Usecase\n\nFor example, I've a component decorator that adds a `resize` event on a DOM element when it get resized. I'd like to be able to dispatch the `resize` event to such element and be able to listen to it using `onResize`.\n\nExample:\n\n``` jsx\nfunction DecoratedComponent(props) {\n  return <div onResize={evt => console.log('resized')}>foobar</div>;\n}\nresizeAware(DecoratedComponent);\n```\n\nFor reference, this is the logic of my decorator that would dispatch the event.\nhttps://gist.github.com/FezVrasta/0324991bbdf044fd2723eebbc344adff\n\nAs you see, right now I'm using `findDOMNode(this.componentNode).dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'))` which makes the `resize` event available only to the real DOM node.\nThis means that I must listen for the event in this way:\n\n``` jsx\nclass DecoratedComponent extends React.Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    findDOMNode(this).addEventListener('resize', evt => console.log('resized'));\n  }\n  render() {\n    return <div>foobar</div>;\n  }\n}\nresizeAware(DecoratedComponent);\n```\n\nThis is very inconvenient and not flexible. We'd need a way to dispatch synthetic events and be able to listen to them using the `onSomething` properties.\n\nI think it would be a great addition to React.\n",
