  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe input cursor jumps to the beginning upon backspacing over the final character or word that follows a space, when the input type is `email`.\r\n\r\n[Reproduced on JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/rnrL751h/); the steps the end-user must take are repeated here:\r\n\r\n- Enter a word + space + character (e.g. 'test 1') in the input (which has `type=\"email\"`).\r\n- Backspace to remove the last character (or word) following the space.\r\n- Observe the cursor jump to the beginning of the input box.\r\n\r\nThe issue does not occur with `input type=\"text\"`. I haven't tried every other type of input yet.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe cursor should not jump. Even if someone mistakenly enters a space into an email input box and then tries to backspace over it, we should not confuse that person more by jumbling their input.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI have observed this with the latest version of React 16 on the following:\r\n\r\n- iOS (11.2.6), Safari.\r\n- macOS (10.12.6 and 10.13.3), Chrome (65.0.3325.181) and Safari (11.0.3).\r\n- Windows 10 (1709), Chrome (65.0.3325.181).\r\n\r\nThe problem did not occur on:\r\n\r\n- Windows 10 (1709), Firefox (58.0)",
