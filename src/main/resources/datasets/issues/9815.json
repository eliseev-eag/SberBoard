  "body": "I was going to give rebasing https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8545 a try and seeing what breaks, but first catching up to latest release of Flow. The big change here is that function call arity is now strictly enforces.\r\n\r\nhttps://flow.org/blog/2017/05/07/Strict-Function-Call-Arity/\r\n\r\nSpecific call outs:\r\n\r\n* Reverted flowâ€™s understanding of `getPooled` and `release` variadic arguments with `...args: args`\r\n* The Fiber implementation was passing arguments through that were not used in a few places.\r\n* ReactNative had a few issues with incomplete stubbed function typedefs. Fleshed those out enough for flow to be okay.\r\n* ReactDOMFiber had an issue with `{is: is}` as the second arg to `createElement`. ignored it with `$FlowIssue`\r\n* ReactDOMFiber every single `createElement` call was erroring because the entry `string` type was erroring when flowing into the more constrained types such as `'span'` or `'th'|'td'`. Got around it by changing the `string` type to the existential `*` type.",
