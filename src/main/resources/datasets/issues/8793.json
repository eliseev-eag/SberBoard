In this case, I want to call `onUploadFile` if a user selects the same file two times in a row, so we set `this.file.value` to null after the first selection so that the `onChange` handler is called the second time the user selects the file. So far so good.\r\n\r\nThe bug is that in IE11, setting `this.file.value` to null causes the `onChange` handler to be called. This is not the case in IE10, Chrome or Firefox. You can validate this by seeing that `onUploadFile` is called twice when selecting a file in IE11, but not in the other browsers.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/5b5y3yt0/\r\n(Actually, in this fiddle the `onUploadFile` callback is called three times in IE11.)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe same behavior in IE10 and IE11 (and Chrome and Firefox).\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 15.4.2 (react@latest in the fiddle).",
