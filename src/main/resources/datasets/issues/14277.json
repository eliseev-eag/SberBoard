This has never been supported but apparently some libraries (like deprecated `react-css-modules`) do that.\r\n\r\nSince this causes confusing warnings in the commit phase (where we aren't sure if it's our bug or not), I'm adding an earlier warning that fires in the render phase and has a component stack.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, I reworded and added component name to the commit phase warning so that it's less difficult to figure out which component causes it.",
