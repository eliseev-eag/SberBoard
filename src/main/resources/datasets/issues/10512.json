  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nThis is a possibly incorrect corner case which we should correct before finalizing the new behavior of unknown attributes. (See https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10399 for more context on the changes to behavior with unknown attributes.)\r\n\r\nIf this happens with unknown attributes, we want to warn and then remove the attribute. The behavior should be consistent between known and unknown attributes.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWe currently throw a generic error when a Symbol is passed to a known attribute which expects a string.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar Hello = React.createClass({\r\n  render: function() {\r\n    return <div className={Symbol('foo')}>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n// rendering this throws \"TypeError: can't convert symbol to string  react-dom.js:2028:11\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/675gk050/1/\r\n\r\nAlso happens with spreading of objects in as props:\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/2m985yt1/2/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nWe should warn and remove the attribute, since that is not a valid value.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nRecent react (15.*) and 16-beta as well.\r\n",
