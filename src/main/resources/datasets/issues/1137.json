  "body": "Both [react-async](https://github.com/andreypopp/react-async) and [react-multiplayer](https://github.com/petehunt/react-multiplayer) need components to have unique identifiers. \n\nIn case of react-async — to maintain a mapping from a component to its state and make it serialisable (to send it over the wire, ES6 Map with components as keys can't be used), in case of react-multiplayer — to have an unique URL per component instance.\n\nCurrently both of the libraries use `this._rootNodeID + ',' + this._mountDepth`. Should this be added to a public API — `getComponentID()` or something?\n",
