  "body": "#### 1. Refactor `ReactDebugCurrentFiber` to use named exports (https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/919d7345693bfc1c693bf2a30b316a572b25ecb8)\r\n\r\nThis makes the difference between it and `ReactFiberCurrentFrame` a bit clearer.\r\n\r\n`ReactDebugCurrentFiber` is Fiber's own implementation. `ReactFiberCurrentFrame` is the \"isomorphic\" thing that holds a reference to the current implementation and delegates to it. Note: Iâ€™m not changing `ReactFiberCurrentFrame` in this PR.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Unify `ReactFiberComponentTreeHook` and `ReactDebugCurrentFiber` (https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/26e0b536357a21476ff483474627b2aa68724afa)\r\n\r\nConceptually they're very related.\r\n\r\n`ReactFiberComponentTreeHook` contains implementation details of reading Fiber's stack (both in DEV and PROD).\r\n\r\n`ReactDebugCurrentFiber` contained a reference to the current fiber, and used `ReactFiberComponentTreeHook` to actually get its stack.\r\n\r\nIn the future, the plan is to stop using these methods explicitly in most places, and instead delegate to a warning system that includes stacks automatically.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Rename methods to better reflect their meanings (https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13165/commits/b4e62956c494703eae944a3a75d187fbbc934e17)\r\n\r\nClarify which are DEV-only, and which can be used for PROD stacks. Clarify which can return null (I opted to do it via naming because we had several bugs where we assumed it's a string).\r\n\r\nI believe the \"work in progress only\" was a mistake. I introduced it because I wasn't sure what guarantees we have around `.return`. But we know for sure that following a `.return` chain gives us an accurate stack even if we get into WIP trees because we don't have reparenting. So it's fine to relax that naming.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis change makes future refactorings simpler by colocating related logic. We don't gain anything from having two modules (`ReactFiberComponentTreeHook` and `ReactDebugCurrentFiber`)  that do almost exactly the same thing, but with different inputs. Its placement in `shared` was also misleading because it's reconciler-specific. It was only in `shared` because in the past there was Stack-related code in this file.",
