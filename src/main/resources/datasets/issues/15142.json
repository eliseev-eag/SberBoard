  "body": "This adds extra warning for when `contextType` exists but is `undefined`. This can happen due to module cycles in legacy environments (see https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13969) and can be very difficult to debug.\r\n\r\nSSR and regular version are copy pasted.\r\n\r\nI separated the DEV check outside the actual code because unlike in the prod code, we actually *do* want to warn for `undefined`-but-not-truthy code path.",
