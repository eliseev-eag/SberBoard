A context consumer expects a single child that is a function. If you did pass a function, make sure there is no trailing or leading whitespace around it.\r\n\r\nand (even more confusing)\r\n\r\n> TypeError: render is not a function\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nMaybe React.cloneElement should not attempt to clone functions? Whatever it does, the result is not a function.\r\n\r\nThe warning part \"a child that isn't a function\" should be separated from the other warnings. There can't be multiple children and one child that is not a function at the same time, so a more precise warning can be issued.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nTested with react 16.3.0 in Stackblitz/Chrome 65 and react 16.3.2 in Chrome 65 and Firefox 59",
