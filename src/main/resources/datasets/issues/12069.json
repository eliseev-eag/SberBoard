  "body": "This creates a tuple for the shadow node since we'll need one canonical value to hold the reactTag and ref, as well as a persistent node whose identity will come from native.\r\n\r\nThis creates a forked version due to the flat bundle but that will not work well in practice because we need some of these to be shared. findNodeHandle, all the ReactNativeComponent and NativeMethodsMixin stuff will need to work when applied to either renderer.\r\n\r\nI did findNodeHandle with injection but the dynamic injection won't actually work until we make that a shared module.\r\n\r\nAlso included a few bug fixes.",
