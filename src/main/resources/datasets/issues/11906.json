  "body": "I'd  like to propose the following when importing `prop-types` to components\r\n\r\nInstead of doing i.e.\r\n```javascript\r\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types'\r\n\r\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\r\n  static propTypes = {\r\n    fetchData: PropTypes.func\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWe could be more concise using destructuring\r\n```javascript\r\nimport { func } from 'prop-types'\r\n\r\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\r\n  static propTypes = {\r\n    fetchData: func\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSmall improvement that makes it easier to see the type of each prop on a component at a glance.\r\n\r\nIs there any reason this hasn't been chosen as the standard? Please give your opinion and reasoning on this.",
