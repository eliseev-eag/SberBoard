  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nA stateful functional component gets suspended by throwing a Promise. When the Promise resolves, the component gets re-rendered as expected, but its state gets reinitialized.\r\n\r\n**CodeSandbox**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/5058xyw5p4 (Open the console)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nState is preserved from one render to another, regardless of what happens after calling the hook.\r\n\r\nA simple workaround is to hoist state up to a parent component.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact/ReactDOM 16.8.3\r\nTested on Chrome and Firefox on macOS\r\nHaven't tried with any previous version\r\n",
