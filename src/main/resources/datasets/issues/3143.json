  "body": "- Updates the jstransform version to include new Flow syntactic features (like `import type` and type casts)\n- Adds new `--es6module` and `--non-strict-es6module` flags to the `jsx` executable\n\nWhy a special flag for es6 modules, you ask?\n\nES6 modules are parsed in a different mode than regular scripts: (1) They are implictly strict-mode (2) Only modules can have `import`/`export` declarations (scripts cannot); So the parser needs to know which mode it should parse the file.\n\nWhats up with `--non-strict-es6module` you ask?\n\nThere are a lot of non-ES6 modules out in the wild (i.e. CommonJS modules) that are just begging to be converted to ES6 modules. However, because es6 modules are implicit-strict, it's not immediately safe to just convert the `require()`s to `import`s and call it a day. So this new `--non-strict-es6module` is a compatibility mode that lets people switch to the new syntax and defer the strict-mode conversion until they have time to come around to it.\n\ncc @sebmck w.r.t. the new Flow syntax features (see https://github.com/facebook/jstransform/commit/de1173c3ee91b916f5921881439863589fca4b1d and https://github.com/facebook/jstransform/commit/a4099d9e2209c4d43df2c009209d87c4c26d9dd0)\n",
