  "body": "This makes Fiber emit the same message as Stack (aside from the missing owner information).\r\n\r\nThe change isn't very useful by itself but I noticed it helps catch regressions in error handling code, particularly around swallowing errors originating in the reconciler. Now that the test passes, such regressions will be visible (for example, #8304 is affected by such a regression but it wasnâ€™t visible because the test was always failing anyway).\r\n\r\nI also added a separate test for including owner name. It passes in Stack but not in Fiber. We can come back to it when we work on warnings that also need it.",
