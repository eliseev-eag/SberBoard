  "body": "TL;DR: I propose we create a simple guard around doubly-including React, which can cause issues if different blocks work with different instances of `React`.\n\nI understand this invariant isn't going to matter to everyone, but I've at two points in so many weeks fixed a bug on a co-worker's project because they were accidentally including React twice in the browser: one from a Browserify bundle, and once from a standalone `<script>`.\n",
