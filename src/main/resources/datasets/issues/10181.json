We do have some iframes embedded, although I haven't been able to reproduce the error.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\nI was unfortunately not able to reproduce this, though it has happened for ~200 separate users since the Firefox 54.0 upgrade on June 13, 2017. If it helps, we reported a similar error a while ago to raven.js (https://github.com/getsentry/raven-js/issues/768) which was fixed using a try/catch.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nNo errors :)\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 15.3.2\r\nFirefox 54.0, Windows and OSX\r\n\r\nI think this is only an issue with the new Firefox, and not new behavior in React.\r\n",
