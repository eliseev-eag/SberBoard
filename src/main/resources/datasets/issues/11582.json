  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nElements with the same key are not deduplicated, which in itself is not unreasonable, I guess, since having duplicate keys is undefined behavior. However, on subsequent rerenders the duplicate elements remain in the render tree with no way to remove them.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce**\r\nhttps://codepen.io/asana/pen/ZaaKzQ (follow the instructions)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nElements with the same key are deduplicated (this was the behavior in React 15: https://codepen.io/asana/pen/RjjVbJ). Or, at the very least, duplicate elements are appropriately cleaned up in subsequent rerenders.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nMac Chrome, React 16+. Working in 15.",
