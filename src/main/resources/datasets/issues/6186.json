  "body": "Should the `context` param of `ReactClass`es be documented? Particularly of the `constructor` of ES6 classes extending `React.Component`?\n\n``` js\nconstructor (props, context)\n```\n\nThe documentation is a bit scattered, so not sure of the relevant places, but I would think:\n- here: [Context](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html)\n- here: [React (Virtual) DOM Terminology](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/glossary.html)\n- perhaps here: [Reusable Components > ES6 Classes](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#es6-classes)\n\nCurrently context isn't mentioned at all on _Reusable Components_ and ES6 authored Component classes aren't mentioned at all on _Context_.\n",
