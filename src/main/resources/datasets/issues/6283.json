  "body": "Pasting the exact code from https://facebook.github.io/react/downloads.html into a HTML file and opening it through a Python 3.4 HTTP server for some reason gives the following error in Chrome:\n\n> Redirect at origin 'https://fb.me' has been blocked from loading by Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:8000' is therefore not allowed access.\n\nI'm able to work around this completely by removing the `integrity` and `crossorigin` attributes from the React and React-Dom script tags:\n\n```\n<script src=\"https://fb.me/react-0.14.7.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://fb.me/react-dom-0.14.7.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nI've never had this issue in Chrome before, and I frequently include external scripts with `crossorigin` and `integrity` attributes with no problem, so I'm lead to believe this may have something to do with the way FB.me is configured.\n",
