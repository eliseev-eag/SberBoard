  "body": "OS: macOs 10.12.1\r\nNode: 6.6.0\r\nNPM: 3.10.3\r\nReact: 15.1.0\r\n\r\nI am getting the warning\r\n```\r\nWarning: You are manually calling a React.PropTypes validation function for the `name` prop on `Greeting`. This is deprecated and will not work in the next major version. You may be seeing this warning due to a third-party PropTypes library. See https://fb.me/react-warning-dont-call-proptypes for details.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've inherited a codebase with an interesting setup that uses an npm package (and therefore a different react instance) to render the DOM (details below). [This comment](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7132#issuecomment-230585137) makes me wonder if that could be the cause of the issue? The package is using 15.1 but the component is defined with React 15.3.2.\r\n\r\nTo test, I copied code [straight from the docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) so I'm quite sure that the warning isn't warranted.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nclass Greeting extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nGreeting.propTypes = {\r\n  name: React.PropTypes.string\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm still getting my head around the architecture of my codebase, but it does something like this:\r\n- A node server waits for requests.\r\n- in `server.js` it imports a component, say `App.jsx` (defined with React instance 1)\r\n- in `server.js` it imports `react-template-server` (an internal library, as an npm package)\r\n- when a request comes in, it passes `App.jsx` to the `react-template-server` instance\r\n- `react-template-server` imports `react-dom` (which I guess is React instance 2?) and uses that to render the passed in component, and returns the rendered HTML.\r\n\r\nIf I take the render logic out of the package and bring it up into the app, I don't get the warning.",
