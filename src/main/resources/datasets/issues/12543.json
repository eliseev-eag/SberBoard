  "body": "We are currently relying on [this comparison](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/1c2876d5b558b8591feb335d8d7204bc46f7da8a/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L791) to prevent consumers with a mismatching bitmask from re-rendering. However, this is not sufficient if bitmask-bailing consumers happen to be parents of a child whose bitmask *is* matching. In that case the parents that should've bailed are being unnecessarily re-rendered.\r\n\r\nCurrently, **`A (matching) -> sCUFalse -> B (not matching) -> sCUFalse -> C (matching)` will cause `B` to re-render**. After this PR, it wouldn't.\r\n\r\nMy new test also passes with the initial implementation of context. In fact this regression is caused by #12470 which was too aggressive. Instead we should've relaxed it to compare just the props object alone.\r\n\r\n**This is not a breaking change because it only affects the `unstable_` code path.**\r\n\r\nAnother reason I think this is correct is because [we already do an identical bailout](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/1c2876d5b558b8591feb335d8d7204bc46f7da8a/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L975) for cases where `changedBits` themselves are 0. A bitmask bailout should behave the same way.",
