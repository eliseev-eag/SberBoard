I had to use the useRef hook to keep the index state between renders, but it only gets updated when I keep a useState (the setCurrentIndex) is with it. When the setCurrentIndex at line 17 is removed, the swapper doesn't works.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nPlease check it out https://codesandbox.io/s/ooy2xrvxky\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI tought that the indexRef wouldn't depend on the state hook to be updated.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16.8.4, Chrome 72.0, Os Ubuntu 16.04.",
