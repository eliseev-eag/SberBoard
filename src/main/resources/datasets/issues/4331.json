  "body": "From the [docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#html-tags-vs.-react-components):\n\n> **Note:**\n> Since JSX is JavaScript, identifiers such as `class` and `for` are discouraged as XML attribute names. Instead, React DOM components expect DOM property names like `className` and `htmlFor`, respectively.\n\nBut the JSX compiler seems to be [smart enough to quote keys like `\"class\"` and `\"for\"`](https://babeljs.io/repl/#?experimental=false&evaluate=false&loose=false&spec=false&code=var%20label%20%3D%20%3Clabel%20id%3D%22foo%22%20class%3D%22bar%22%20for%3D%22other%22%2F%3E%3B) (so they'll work fine even in pre-ES5 environments). So what's the problem? Why are they discouraged, and what exactly does that mean?\n",
