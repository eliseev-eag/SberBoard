  "body": "I understand [https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3102] is considered fixed, but I'm still having similar issues on my iPhone.  I did the following with React 0.13.3 and Immutable 3.7.3 (using Webpack + Babel ES6 stage 0 transpiler -- not sure if that might have an effect):\n\n```\nReact.render(<ul>\n  {Immutable.List([1,2,3]).map(i => <li>{i}</li>)}\n</ul>, document.body);\n```\n\nThis works properly in Chrome on my desktop.  However, in Safari on my iPhone, it prints the number 3035 without a bullet above the list items.\n\nMy user agent string for Safari on my iPhone is:\n`Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 8_3 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/600.1.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/8.0 Mobile/12F70 Safari/600.1.4`\n\nThanks!\nAndy\n",
