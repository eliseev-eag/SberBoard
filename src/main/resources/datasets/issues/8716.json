  "body": "- When the children are reconciled, set the work priority of the parent to the current priority level. Do not set the work priority of the children.\r\n- In `findNextUnitOfWork`, we need to check both the update priority and the work priority of the root, since the work priority field no longer represents both.\r\n- In `scheduleUpdate`, when bubbling the priority to the root, skip the fiber that is being updated on and start with the parent.\r\n- Move `resetWorkPriority` from `commitAllWork` in the scheduler into `ReactFiberCompleteWork` so we can branch on the type of the component. This is needed for HostComponents, which may have leftover work priority if we bailed out on a hidden subtree.\r\n- Because a fiber has no field that represents its own priority, we cannot bailout on low priority at the beginning of `beginWork`. Instead we have to perform that check while performing work on the parent, before its child is returned.",
