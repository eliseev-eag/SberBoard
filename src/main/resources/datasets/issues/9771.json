  "body": "**Edit:** Fixed the rest of the issues, this should be good to go now.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\ncherrypick and hand-edit various parts of commits from master to do the following - \r\n - add `create-react-class` and `prop-types` as dependencies of React\r\n - add the deprecation warning for `React.createClass` and get it from the `create-react-class` package\r\n - add tests for the `React.createClass` and `React.PropTypes` deprecation warnings\r\n - adds test for `create-react-class` as used in React\r\n\r\n--- \r\n*(Original PR message below)*\r\n\r\nThis is a butchered version of https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9232https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9232 with some of https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9399 mixed in. I don't have the tests passing, and there is something not quite right about the way this landed.\r\n\r\n1. Not sure if we want `createReactClass` or `ReactClass.createClass`, and updating that caused an error:\r\n- src/isomorphic/classic/class/createClass.js was added to master in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9399/files\r\n- that file is used in `src/isomorphic/React.js` and itself uses `var {Component} = require('ReactBaseClasses');`\r\n- in 15.6, that line throws `Cannot find module 'ReactBaseClasses' from 'createClass.js'` and I have no idea why\r\n- So instead I left it using the old implementation of 'createClass'\r\n\r\n2. There is still a test failing for `ReactART` and I have not figure out why. Something in `ReactReconcileTransaction.perform` triggers `TypeError: Cannot read property 'call' of undefined`.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy for any guidance or tips from folks who made those PRs - @acdlite  and/or @bvaughn. I am going to delay doing a RC of 15.6 because this is pretty vital to get right.\r\n\r\nStill TODO: improve the deprecation message itself.",
