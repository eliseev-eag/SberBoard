  "body": "The other day I was talking to @rpflorence about the usage of context in [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router). My initial curiosity came from needing to do something like this [this](https://gist.github.com/rpflorence/1f72da0cd9e507ebec29) to stub the context of a component for a test. I had some concerns (angular `$scope`?), but Ryan helped me see that context is basically just like props and everything is still explicit.\n\nAfterwards I was thinking more about it. I can see the value in having context, but the one thing that still doesn't feel right to me is now components have to be concerned with how the parent passes data to it. Since `context` and `props` are basically the same, what if the two were merged? A component would only define `propTypes` and it would include everything that can/should be passed to it from above in one place without being concerned with how the props get there. At this point `getChildContext()` (maybe renamed to `getChildProps()`?) would just be an additional method of passing props. Anything that could be passed to a component via `context` could also be passed as `props` and vice versa.\n\nSomething like this:\n\n``` jsx\nvar Parent = React.createClass({\n  childPropTypes: {\n    foo: React.PropTypes.string\n  },\n  getChildProps: function () {\n    return {\n      foo: \"bar\"\n    }\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <Child/>\n        <Child foo=\"baz\"/>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nvar Child = React.createClass({\n  propTypes: {\n    foo: React.PropTypes.string\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    return <div>{this.props.foo}</div>\n  }\n})\n\nReact.render(<Parent/>, document.body)\n```\n\nWould render:\n\n``` html\n<div>\n  <div>bar</div>\n  <div>baz</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThoughts?\n",
