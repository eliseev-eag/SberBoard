For example on [the changelog page under Breaking Changes](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-changes), there's a link to the `createFragment` helper but it points to `https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/react/docs/create-fragment.html` which does not exist. the `React.cloneElement` link in the same section suffers the same fate. Possibly others?\n",
