I haven't tested in IE11 yet (setting that up now), but after ensuring Firefox is running in lazy mode here, this does do what Ben was thinking, at least for the insert case. I need to do some more testing and see if this is an issue with updates (I think we should be ok there but will check).\n\nFixes #6246.\n",
