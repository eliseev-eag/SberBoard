  "body": "# Adds Danger\r\n\r\nAdds [danger-js](http://danger.systems/js/) with a single rule taken from the [React Native Dangerfile](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/danger/dangerfile.js). I am less familiar with React, the repo, than I am with the process around React Native. So I didn't want to intrude.\r\n\r\n> Danger runs during your CI process, and gives teams the chance to automate common code review chores.\r\n\r\n> This provides another logical step in your build, through this Danger can help lint your rote tasks in daily code review.\r\n\r\nWhich means that you can start writing simple scripts to handle \"Add a CHANGELOG\" or \"No merger commits please\" basically. @hramos wrote a bunch in RN, and there is [an API reference here](http://danger.systems/js/reference.html). You can test changes locally by running `node node_modules/.bin/danger pr https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/[ID]`.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n\r\n* Adds Danger as one of the build steps during CI\r\n* Adds the same API token as React Native ( for @facebook-open-source-bot ) ([example](https://github.com/facebook-open-source-bot)) \r\n\r\nI'm not _100%_ certain that I added it into the right section in test_entry_point.sh - happy to change that if you have better ideas.",
