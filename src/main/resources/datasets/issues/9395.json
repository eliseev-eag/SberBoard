  "body": "Historically, React has logged warnings to `console.error` (rather than `console.warn`). I believe this has been done for a variety of reasons:\r\n1. Certain types of warnings may indicate a serious problem even if they are not always fatal.\r\n1. In the past, stack trace was not available with `console.warn` calls.\r\n\r\nDeprecation warnings are intended to provide users a heads-up on features that will be changing/breaking in the next major release. Up until now we have also logged these warnings to `console.error`. This makes them more noticeable but comes at the cost of:\r\n1. Potentially over-emphasizing the urgency of addressing them. (eg you should address them before upgrading to the next major, you don't need to address the _now_).\r\n1. Potentially causing CI test failures for certain runners that treat unexpected `console.error` calls as fatal.\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion the React team has decided to replace `console.error` calls with `console.warn` _for deprecation warnings only_. We intend to release this change in the upcoming 15.6 release.",
