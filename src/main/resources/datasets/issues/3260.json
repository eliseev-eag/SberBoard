  "body": "I have a small mixin that creates a propType as follows:\n\n```\nvar OtherDataMixin = {\n    propTypes: {\n      otherData: React.PropTypes.object\n    },\n    getInitialState: function () {\n      this.otherData=getAll();\n      return this.otherData;\n    },\n};\nreturn OtherDataMixin;\n```\n\nwhere the getAll() function returns an Object like this\n\n```\n{variables: Object, theme: Object, functions: Object, wanted: Object, AppShell: Object }\n```\n\nEffectively passing back a custom collection of objects with various values that are being used.\n\nThe property this.otherData holds this information and you can reference it from components using a standard dot notation, so this.otherData.variables.timeout gets a value;\n\nThe issue is that for some reason this is all getting flattened into this.attributes\nso this.attributes now has these objects\n\n```\nattributes: Object\n    AppShell: Object \n    className: 'app-shell',\n    functions: Object,\n    theme: Object,\n    variables: Object,\n    wanted: Object,\n    __proto__: Object\n```\n\nbut there is no sign of the otherData object at all...\nI could logically have understooed if it adding the custom property to this.props, which would then be\n\n```\nprops: Object\n    children: Array[2]\n    otherData: object\n```\n\nGo I guess my questions are two fold:\n- Why has it put this into this.attributes in the first place and not this.props?\n- Why did it flattened the hierarchy, instead of just adding otherData as an object ?\n",
