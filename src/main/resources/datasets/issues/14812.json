  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen updating the state from `useState` doesn't actually update the component. In this case it is being updated on an event handler. I used `console.log` to verify that it is being called yet no update in the component is being dispatched. It's like React doesn't register that it wants to update the state.\r\n\r\nMight want to throw out that I'm new with this React Hooks and it could be something that I'm missing.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.**\r\nI've setup a simple example showcasing my issue, I also included an implementation with the old class syntax and when doing it with classes, it works fine. [Here is the link to the CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/mjz3o5xnly)\r\n\r\nThis example is taken from my project, I'm fading out and translating upwards so I want to keep the text until the animation is done.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe component should update with the new registered state when trying to update state in a event handler.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact v16.8\r\nReact DOM v16.8\r\n",
