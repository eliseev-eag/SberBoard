  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nFeature, I guess, despite the subject formulation.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIf an update is performed exactly at the wrong moment (on native `click` capture on document root), it happens just between the moment React decides that the `onChange` handler for a checkbox should be called and the moment it is called. As a result, it's impossible to tell what the new value is inside the `onChange` handler. (In other words, in that particular case, `event.target.checked` is back to the old unchanged value when the `onChange` handler is called.)\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.**\r\n\r\n[Here](https://jsfiddle.net/hon2a/dwofvdye/)'s a demo. Note how clicking on the checkbox never checks it.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThat's up for discussion. I'd probably expect the `onChange` not to be triggered at all, and a warning to be issued, so that it's easier to figure this out and remove the cause (it took me quite some time :)). Even nicer would be some special property of the `SyntheticEvent` holding the correct changed value, but that might be too big of a change for such a edge-case scenario.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nChrome / Win / React 15.4.1 (but it likely applies to all browsers/OS)",
