  "body": "In my React component I have to render around 200 input fields. when I render component, browser gets hanged and screen becomes blank(I checked task manager their browser starts taking around 5000 MB space and CPU utilization reaches to 100%). If I refresh the page then same component is rendering very easily and screen also fine. This is issue I am facing only in my production environment and in dev environment it works absolutely fine on first render without refresh.\r\n\r\nThis happens only in Google crome. When I do same thing in Mozila it works fine.\r\n\r\nPlease suggest any solution. I am using React 16.2.0.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.",
