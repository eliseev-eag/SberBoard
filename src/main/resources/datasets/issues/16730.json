  "body": "This PR does two things:\r\n\r\n- Removes the `stopPropagation` prop from the Press responder module. After internal inspection, this prop seems to have been misused internally because a misunderstanding on what it does. It thus makes sense to remove this prop, because it was always intended to be a temporary hack.\r\n- Ensure that we always listen to captures on the `document`. Given we no longer can use `stopPropagation` we no longer have the issue of blocking other event systems already on the `document`.",
