  "body": "This pull request introduces a **breaking change** to how React handles custom elements / web components. The change is that React props are currently passed to custom elements via `setAttribute`, but now are passed as properties on the dom element itself.\r\n\r\nSee discussion in #7901, specifically [this comment](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7901#issuecomment-256755466) where @sebmarkbage indicated that this change would be part of the next major release of React. Since react@16.0.0-alpha was released yesterday and is on the master branch, I'm hoping that now is the right time for this breaking change to make it into the master branch. I'm not sure if anyone else was planning on implementing this or not.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- This makes it a lot easier to pass non-string data down to custom elements (e.g., objects can be passed without getting stringified to `[Object object]`). Instead of `<custom-element ref={el => el.myProp = myProp} />`, you can just do `<custom-element myProp={myProp} />`.\r\n- This does *not* solve the problem of how to interoperate with events fired by custom elements. If this pr is merged, I will follow it up with another one to tackle that problem, using the proposed solution in #7901 as a guide.\r\n- I am not doing `Object.assign(element, props)` (like @sebmarkbage suggested) because that does not delete any props that are passed conditionally to the custom element. Also, `Object.assign(element, props)` bypasses the events recorded in ReactHostOperationHistory, which seems like another reason against doing so. Not sure if ReactHostOperationHistory is important or not for custom elements, though.\r\n- I did not change the corresponding ReactDOMFiberComponent because I wasn't sure if I should do so.\r\n- The linter was broken for me on the master branch before I made any changes, but my changes did not introduce any new warnings or errors as far as I can tell.",
