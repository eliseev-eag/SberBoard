  "body": "After using the new devtools profiler (which is awesome btw!) I discovered that one of my components was rerendering because \"the parent component rendered\", despite being `React.memo`ed and taking no props, which seemed like an impossibility (see [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/pelotom/status/1182482183769882626?s=20) documenting my confusion). I eventually discovered that it was in fact updating due to context changes, and @bvaughn [helpfully pointed out](https://twitter.com/brian_d_vaughn/status/1182654239627075584?s=20) that the message was a fallback used when the component rerendered due to reasons other than state and props changing.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to make the wording a little more accurate: in addition to adding the \"or context changed\" caveat, it seems like \"Internal state changed\" is a more accurate description than \"Hooks changed\", because updates due to the `useContext` hook don't fall in that category. Ideally in the special case where the component is memoized the message could definitively say the update was due to a context change, but I'm not sure how to detect that situation ðŸ™‚",
