Contrary it is bubbles from very bottom element to the very top element.\n\nIn Chrome, FF, IE10, and IE11 native **mouseenter** bubbling works as expected (from top to bottom)... Also **mouseover** bubbles from top to bottom, as expected, either in native or in React.\n\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/25483/\n",
