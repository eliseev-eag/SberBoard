  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nPerhaps a bug, but could also be seen as a feature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen you move an element to a portal through `ReactDOM.createPortal` the element looses focus if it had focus. If the element gains focus while in a portal, when moving out of the portal it looses focus.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would have expected React to maintain focus of the element when moving in or out of a portal\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nTested with\r\n\r\nReact version: 16.2\r\nBrowsers: Latest chrome and firefox. I did not test others but expect the behaviour to be the same\r\nOS: Tested on Mac High Sierra\r\n",
