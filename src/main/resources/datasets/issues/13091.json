  "body": "Will you be the hero to review this PR?\r\nWould be great to get the fix landed in Monday's sync. üòÅ\r\n\r\n**what is the change?:**\r\nIf 'requestAnimationFrame' is not called for 100ms we fall back to\r\n'setTimeout' to schedule the postmessage.\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nWhen you start loading a page, and then switch tabs,\r\n'requestAnimationFrame' is throttled or not called until you come back\r\nto that tab. That means React's rendering, any any other scheduled work,\r\nare paused.\r\n\r\nUsers expect the page to continue loading, and rendering is part of the\r\npage load in a React app. So we need to continue calling callbacks.\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nManually tested using the new fixture test, observed that the callbacks\r\nwere called while switched to another tab. They were called more\r\nslowly, but that seems like a reasonable thing.\r\n\r\n**issue:**\r\nInternal task T30754186",
