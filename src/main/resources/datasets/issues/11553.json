  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nA bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThe following console warning is emitted every time a `<select>` input is clicked:\r\n\r\n\r\n`[Violation] Added non-passive event listener to a scroll-blocking 'mousewheel' event. Consider marking event handler as 'passive' to make the page more responsive. See https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5745543795965952`\r\n\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template for React 16: https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/, template for React 15: https://jsfiddle.net/hmbg7e9w/).**\r\n\r\nThe steps are:\r\n\r\n1. In a new tab, visit https://codepen.io/anon/pen/QOgNKg\r\n\r\n2. Open the browser console and ensure messages are unfiltered\r\n\r\n3. Run the code and click either of the select fields on the page. \r\n\r\nA warning is emitted every time either select field is clicked. The selection does not need to change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThere should be no warning as i have not attached any event listeners.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.1.0\r\nChrome 62.0.3202.89 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\nTested also on Ubuntu Opera and has the same issue.\r\n\r\nThe issue began appearing for me after a recent upgrade of Chrome. I was using React 15-stable when i first saw it, so i upgraded to 16.1.0 to see if the issue is resolved and it was not.\r\n",
