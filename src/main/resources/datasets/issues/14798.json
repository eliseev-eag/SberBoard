  "body": "For those of us who would like style encapsulation without wanting to adopt web components as a whole (e.g. not using custom elements), it would be nice if it was easier to use shadow DOM for a React component. \r\n\r\nBoth Angular and Stencil offer relatively simple and nice API's for utilising the style encapsulation of shadow DOM. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft Edge announced that it was working on shadow DOM a while ago, and is now switching to Chromium, so will support shadow DOM once the Chromium-based version of Edge is released. Safari/Chrome/Opera/Firefox already support it. ",
