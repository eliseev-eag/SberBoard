  "body": "After I updated React to the latest version (@16.9.0), I am getting warnings below from most of the components. I am using material-ui, formik and tables.\r\n* I've updated React in order to move from react-testing-library to testing-library/react.\r\n\r\n`The component appears to be a function component that returns a class instance. Change InputLabel to a class that extends React.Component instead. If you can't use a class try assigning the prototype on the function as a workaround. `InputLabel.prototype = React.Component.prototype`. Don't use an arrow function since it cannot be called with `new` by React.`\r\n\r\nI would like to keep my code with functional components using react hook as much as possible. \r\nIs there any other work around or should I just downgrade react ?\r\n\r\n    \"react\": \"^16.9.0\",\r\n    \"react-dom\": \"^16.9.0\",\r\n    \"react-router-dom\": \"^5.0.1\",\r\n    \"@material-ui/core\": \"^3.1.2\",\r\n    \"formik\": \"^1.5.8\",",
