  "body": "For now, I left \"fiber\" in the names of several modules because I wanted to reduce the amount of churn introduced with this PR. This change has minimal impact on the fiber flat bundle (see diff [in comment below](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10511#issuecomment-324175037)).\r\n\r\nCommits are vaguely atomic. (Renames are isolated at least.)\r\n\r\n@spicyj and I are tagged on a couple of tangentially-related TODO items in the repo still, but I think they are probably better done as smaller follow-up items.\r\n\r\nSynced to fbsource, ran Flow+Jest, and did a quick smoke-test with Ads Manager.
