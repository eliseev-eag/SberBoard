  "body": "I've found a strange issue with React when packaged using webpack. The issue doesn't make sense, as both the browser (when used in development mode) and the webpack build pipeline throw SyntaxError on ternary operator's ```:```. Not sure who to blame: webpack, auth0-lock or React, but everything fails inside of React, so here we go. \r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\nHere is my setup:\r\nhttps://github.com/Remper/react_bug\r\n\r\nIt's an empty Angular2 application that shows [auth0-lock](https://github.com/auth0/lock).\r\n\r\nAuth0-lock uses React as a dependency and everything is being bundled by webpack (the exact config is in the repository as well).\r\n\r\n### What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nNow when I try to launch this setup I get a SyntaxError which points to a perfectly valid line in React sources. In particular, it doesn't like ternary operators much: if I replace them with ifs manually â€” it breaks somewhere else inside of React:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR in js/app.6a0a1796a34dcc432afe.js from UglifyJs\r\nSyntaxError: Unexpected token: punc (:) [./~/react/lib/ReactComponentTreeHook.js:164,0][js/app.6a0a1796a34dcc432afe.js:13802,8]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is how it looks when I disable UglifyJs: http://remper.ru/bug/\r\n\r\n### What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nReact should work when included as a dependency and packaged with webpack. \r\n\r\n```npm run build``` shouldn't report any issues.\r\n",
