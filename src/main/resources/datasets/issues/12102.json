  "body": "Using React 16.2.0, I'm running into a very strange behavior when things work fine locally, but in production (using Meteor) `setState` stops working.\r\n\r\nHere's what I've noticed:\r\n\r\n- `setState`'s callback is never called. \r\n- The DOM doesn't reflect any changes.\r\n- The Devtools don't reflect the changes. \r\n- Calling `this.forceUpdate()` after `setState` doesn't do anything. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand:\r\n\r\n- `$r.state` returns an object with the correct updated state.\r\n- `setState` returns an object with the correct updated state.\r\n\r\nI'm sure the problem is on my side somehow (it's a fairly complex component which I didn't even write myself to make matters worse) but I thought maybe I could get some tips on how to go along debugging this frustrating issue?\r\n",
