(Edge has an open bug on this but of course IE11 is abandonware.)\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.**\r\n\r\nTab to to the only div in this repro and hold down a key:\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/acsr4ofu/\r\n\r\nBug: 'repeat!' alert does not appear in IE11\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nAn alert dialog showing 'repeat!' should appear in any browser that React supports.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nCurrent version of React, any browser which does not natively support `KeyboardEvent.repeat` but IE/Edge in particular (Chrome always supported; FF since 28; Safari since 10.1). Unknown if this worked in previous versions of React.",
