  "body": "This is a follow-up to my other pull-request: #6349. Using `Node.contains` appears to be extremely efficient, and took some time to explore its use in the `lowestCommonAncestor` function. \n\nLike the other PR, I did some profiling. [`Node.contains`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/contains) is surprisingly fast. I'm sure there are flaws in the benchmark itself. However I think it's still compelling.\n\nhttps://github.com/nhunzaker/lowest-common-ancestor-bench\n### Chrome 49\n\n```\nDepth method x 3,088,855 ops/sec ±3.50% (56 runs sampled)\nContains method x 3,295,131 ops/sec ±0.95% (58 runs sampled)\nFastest is Contains method\n```\n### Safari 9\n\n```\nDepth method x 1,940,537 ops/sec ±8.66% (31 runs sampled) (index.html, line 82)\nContains method x 3,980,743 ops/sec ±8.51% (33 runs sampled) (index.html, line 82)\nFastest is Contains method\n```\n### Firefox 45\n\n```\nDepth method x 1,875,566 ops/sec ±1.19% (61 runs sampled)\nContains method x 5,839,094 ops/sec ±0.96% (58 runs sampled)\nFastest is Contains method\n```\n",
