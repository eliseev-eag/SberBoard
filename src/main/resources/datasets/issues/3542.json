  "body": "Currently, React supports only regular JavaScript objects for `ReactDOMComponent`s' style props, using their enumerated keys:\n\n```\ndivStyle = {color: \"white\"};\nReact.createElement(\"div\", {style: divStyle}, \"…\")\n```\n\nBut it would be wonderful if it could also support generic data for CSS styles through, e.g., the iterable interface. That would enable Immutable.js and ClojureScript data structures to be directly used as their styles:\n\n```\ndivStyle = Immutable.Map({color: \"white\"});\nReact.createElement(\"div\", {style: divStyle}, \"…\")\n```\n\nCurrently, this necessitates converting the generic data into regular JavaScript style objects for every styled element for every render, which is pretty wasteful.\n\nIn general, it's extremely useful to be able to express styles as generic data, especially persistent immutable data structures, in order to let the end user manipulate the data in the application's UI (e.g., for end-user UI themes), to serialize the data, and to dynamically merge and manipulate the data as needed at runtime. \n\n[React Native already supports the last sort of thing with merging `StyleSheet`s](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/style.html), but it’s uncertain whether regular React will have it (see https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/2196), and it'd be even better for serializability and manipulability if generic style data could be used.\n\nPotential problems:\n- This suggestion might or might not slow down React reconciliation or rendering.\n- React Native already has a `{style: [styleObject1, styleObject2]}` standard syntax, used for merging style objects together. Unless that is revised (e.g., by adding a `StyleSheet.merge` method and having people use that instead), it may not be possible to also support generic style data in React Native, which might create too great of an API mismatch between React and React Native.\n\nNonetheless, I think generic style data are quite important, and I'm already using them copiously, especially for UI themes.\n\n[Somewhat related to #3059.]\n",
