  "body": "Hi,\n\nI have a fairly trivial application which was running on ReactJS 0.14.x. Since I've moved it to 15rc1, it continues to work perfectly in Chrome. However, in IE11, in appears to render critical parts empty. The relevant piece of code where I'm failing is here:\n\nhttps://github.com/technion/erlvulnscan/blob/master/frontend/assets/erlvulnscan.jsx#L37\n\nThere is no error output on the debug console. The DOM explorer appears to just render it with missing data.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\" role=\"alert\"></div>\n\n\nYou can see the application with the relevant behaviour running live at: https://erlvulnscan.lolware.net. Enter any network (127.0.0.0 will yield the fastest return) to see the issue.\n\nEdit: For non IE users, you can see a SS here: http://imgur.com/i9TciqZ\n",
