Why the naming convention?\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nHTML's Type Convention whenever possible? If HTML is not good follow some other convention like XAML, GTK, and others. Not really familiar on GUI Ecosystem history, good to have constructive opinion how one library work better in this convention better than other, not every library is perfect in convention and specification. \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16.3.2. The demo code is in [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/o7ov511kz)",
