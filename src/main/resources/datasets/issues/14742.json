  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nI would like to be able to programmatically set focus to an element inside the fallback of a Suspense component. I'm able to verify that componentDidMount fires with my current setup but I never get focus on the desired element nor does the screen reader I test with announce the \"Loading...\" text. I believe this is because the fallback is not appearing in the DOM (at least from what I can see in dev mode).\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.**\r\n\r\nBelow is a minimal version of my setup, although I'm not sure how to force delay the lazy loaded component in order to show the Loading fallback.\r\nExample: https://codesandbox.io/s/qvmp1jlol6\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nFocus is set to the h1 tag with the loading text (and a screen reader is able to announce it, but I don't expect that to be addressed in this issue).\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact/React-dom 16.7.0\r\nThis behavior was not working in IE or Chrome. \r\n",
