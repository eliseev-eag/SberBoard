  "body": "Repro: https://jsfiddle.net/5t5ua47c/\nIn the example, a click handler in the subtree queues an update for both the the subtree and parent components, with the following ordering of lifecycle methods:\n\n```\nparent will update\n> child will update\n>> subtree will update\n> child did update\nparent did update\n>> subtree did update\n```\n\nIf the parent component unmounts the subtree in `componentDidUpdate` this will cause the subtree to be unmounted by the time that its `componentDidUpdate` method is called (https://jsfiddle.net/v5fk4xvx/1/):\n\n```\nparent will update\n> child will update\n>> subtree will update\n> child did update\nparent did update (unmount subtree)\n>> subtree will unmount\n>> subtree did update\n```\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n\nProbably this:\n\n```\nparent will update\n> child will update\n>> subtree will update\n> child did update\n>> subtree did update\nparent did update\n```\n",
