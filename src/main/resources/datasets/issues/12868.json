  "body": "Rollup has a bunch of warnings (like unresolved import, or different values for the same export) which really are errors in the sense that we never want them in our code. However, plugins also use the same system for stuff that isn't as important (e.g. Babel helpers duplication).\r\n\r\nNow that we rely on ES modules more heavily, I'm making Rollup's own warnings fail the build. This ensures we can't miss a regression like this in the console output, but can still ignore warnings from plugins.",
