  "body": "There is an infinite loop when there are components with error on render and with `onMount` callback, which calls update of parent component.\r\n\r\nHere is code https://jsfiddle.net/8nh7hobv/\r\n\r\nWhen I run this code, I have unexpected infinite loop. I expect code to stop on thrown error. \r\n\r\nSuddenly, if I change `render` method of `Main` component to \r\n\r\n```\r\nrender() {\r\n\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>{''} // just add an empty text node here\r\n                {this.state.item ? (\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        {'something'}\r\n                        <WithOnMount\r\n                            onMount={this.handleOnMount}\r\n                        />\r\n                        <WithError />\r\n                    </div>\r\n\r\n                ) : 'nothing'}\r\n            </div>\r\n        );\r\n\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nit works as expected. Here is code with correct behaviour https://jsfiddle.net/d18jnq0p/\r\n\r\nI get this bug with React-ReactDOM 15.4.1, it looks like version 0.14.7 works correct in both cases.",
