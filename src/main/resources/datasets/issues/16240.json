  "body": "Opening this to share the approach andrew et al, and answer some pending questions.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, for tests (specifically, code inside an `act()` scope), we immediately trigger work that would have otherwise required a timeout. This makes it simpler to tests loading/spinner states, and makes tests resilient to changes in React.\r\n\r\nFor some of our tests(specifically, ReactSuspenseWithNoopRenderer-test.internal), we _don't_ want fallbacks to immediately trigger, because we're testing intermediate states and such. Added a feature flag `flushSuspenseFallbacksInTests` to disable this behaviour on a per case basis.\r\n\r\nOpen questions - \r\n- should react warn you if you try to suspend outside an act scope?\r\n",
