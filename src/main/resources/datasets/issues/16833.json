  "body": "This PR is a sort of spiritual follow up to https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/16822. Here are the changes outlined in this PR:\r\n\r\n- Keyboard responder now provides `preventDefault` and `continuePropagation` to the user event. Keyboard still does not propagate to other keyboard responders by default, but provides a method to allow it to continue and extra level. I had to update tests respectfully, as we previous used the return value from the event (which was a bit confusing).\r\n- Keyboard responder now does not `preventDefault` any events by default. Instead, the user can optionally control this by calling `preventDefault` like already done on the web. The `Press` responder has been updated to ensure that the same standard behavior exists as before.\r\n- The accessibility components have been updated to properly make use of this new functionality.",
