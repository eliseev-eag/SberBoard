  "body": "This wins back 0.3k post min/gzip which we lost due to adding license headers ðŸ˜› We can later share more utilities like this, since currently it's suboptimal that some `fbjs` things are duplicated. This only affects UMD builds.\r\n\r\nHow I verified it works:\r\n\r\n* Fixtures work (but they were broken between changing the bundling logic and adding an export)\r\n* The combined size has decreased\r\n* The diff makes sense (https://gist.github.com/gaearon/75431ad02d69a08e95aef6fba2645244), most of it is renaming `index` to `assign` though (since Rollup gives it a different name now)\r\n\r\nIt only affects UMD builds and doesnâ€™t affect any other builds.\r\nThis is not global shared state, it's just manual deduplication.",
