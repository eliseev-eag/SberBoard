  "body": "This is leaning more to a question than solid bug report as I have no solid repro. It started occurring in my application recently but it could just as well be due to a bad implementation in my application.\n\nMy question is: Is this supposed to be able to happen, ie. should _renderedChildren be able to be undefined (which is what's causing the for loop in unmountChildren to throw an error). If not, what might I be doing wrong for this to be occurring to me in my application?\n\nThe code I'm referring to: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/2aeb8a2a6beb00617a4217f7f8284924fa2ad819/src/core/ReactMultiChild.js#L329\n",
