  "body": "This changes the \"default\" retryTime to NoWork which schedules at Normal pri.\r\n\r\nDehydrated bouundaries normally hydrate at Never priority except when they retry where we accidentally increased them to Normal because Never was used as the default value. This changes it so NoWork is the default.\r\n\r\nDehydrated boundaries however get initialized to Never as the default.\r\n\r\nTherefore they now hydrate as Never pri unless their priority gets increased by a forced rerender or selective hydration.\r\n\r\nThis revealed that erroring at this Never priority can cause an infinite rerender. So I fixed that too.\r\n",
