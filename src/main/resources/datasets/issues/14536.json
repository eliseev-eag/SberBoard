  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nIt's a feature. \r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nReact.Suspense mounts its children with a `display: none` style if a promise is thrown. Once the thrown promise is resolved, React removes the `display: none` style.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe children components have no easy way to know when the `display: none` style is removed by React. This is problematic when one child component needs to read from the DOM layout to correctly display its elements. Most people wait for the `componentDidMount` callback to trigger, but because the element is `display: none`, it can't read any value from the DOM layout.\r\n\r\nThe issue was discovered in https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/14077. I believe that React should provide a lifecycle so the children components know when they are visible, that it's safe to do layout computations. \r\n\r\nThe best workaround I'm aware of it to use the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) but it requires a polyfill on IE 11 and Safari.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nVersion: 16.7.0-alpha.2",
