  "body": "This is a rough proof of concept. It adds production mode runner project to our Jest setup.\r\n\r\nExample running a test in Stack, Fiber DEV and Fiber PROD:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"698\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-07-25 at 5 17 39 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/28582428-403c0242-715d-11e7-8d60-547e8df1cbd1.png\">\r\n\r\nNot all unit tests are friendly to this. And it doesn't completely represent the PROD mode because I haven't applied PROD transforms. For example it doesn't strip `warning` calls leading to:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1012\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-07-25 at 5 19 25 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/28582473-6b708596-715d-11e7-8e30-90fc21d68e95.png\">\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, applying all PROD transforms would also be a bit tricky because we often assert on error message name which would be stripped. Maybe we can have `toThrowReactError` matcher that just expects `Minified exception` in PROD.\r\n\r\nSome are explicitly DEV only tests:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"651\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-07-25 at 5 23 40 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/28582629-093e7102-715e-11e7-8585-2a5f1835cfa5.png\">\r\n\r\nWe should probably gate them.\r\n\r\nThis is also surfacing what appears to be Jest multi project runner bugs. For example, it appears that some mocks get broken in multi project setup:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"902\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-07-25 at 5 24 10 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/28582669-242b4756-715e-11e7-8c3f-8382c2aa3de2.png\">\r\n<img width=\"847\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-07-25 at 5 24 45 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/28582680-2b4d5326-715e-11e7-8f7f-9fa1224e2717.png\">\r\n\r\nOverall I think this is a promising direction but we'll need Jest MPR to become more stable to continue.",
