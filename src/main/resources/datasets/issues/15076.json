Do I have to name my custom Hooks starting with ‚Äúuse‚Äù?\r\nA. Please do. This convention is very important. Without it, we wouldn‚Äôt be able to automatically check for violations of rules of Hooks because we couldn‚Äôt tell if a certain function contains calls to Hooks inside of it.\r\n\r\ne.g. `const isAwesome = useAwesomeLogic(props.id);`\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIt'd be great if we could remove the \"ambiguity\" around whether a function used in a component is a hook or not, by adding a wrapper method in React which just returns the function passed in the argument. Think of it as syntactic sugar for expressing that a certain method is being \"used\" as a hook.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n```\r\nconst isAwesome = React.use(awesomeLogic(props.id));\r\nor\r\nconst isAwesome = React.useCustom(awesomeLogic(props.id));\r\nor\r\nconst isAwesome = React.useCustomHook(awesomeLogic(props.id));\r\n```\r\n\r\nI started learning React last week, so please ignore this if I missed something trivial or it just doesn't make any sense. üòÖ\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?**\r\n\r\n16.8+",
