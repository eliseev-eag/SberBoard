I.e I have a situation when I hook up a ref from multiple components via context, because one of the components needs to calculate the layout and the other ref is passed by the consumer.\r\n\r\nHere is a little snapshot:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const MegaComponent = React.forwardRef(function MegaComponent (props, ref) {\r\n  return (<Context.Consumer>{\r\n      (context) => (\r\n        <PrivateMegaComponent {...context} ref={(value) => {\r\n          // Runtime implementation detail\r\n          // Seriously, I just happen to know it's RefObject.\r\n          context.ref.current = value;\r\n\r\n          if (ref) {\r\n            // Always good to dive into how runtime works\r\n            if (typeof ref === 'function') {\r\n              ref(value)\r\n            } else if (typeof ref === 'object') {\r\n              ref.current = value;\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }}>\r\n          {props.children}\r\n        </PrivateMegaComponent >\r\n      )}\r\n    </Context.Consumer>\r\n  );\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI expect that React would provide a way to compose `refs` so that consumer wouldn't have to dive into runtime implementation details and reimplement what React already does.\r\n",
