  "body": "I just came back to react after about a year or so of not using it and now the getting started docs are pretty much not helpful in the slightest. All the docs are now is just links to other websites without any instructions on how to get a react project running. I remember a year ago back in react 15 the docs had a step by step walkthrough for how to set up and get a project running from scratch and now they are just links to websites without react specific instructions. What happened to the docs, when did they become so useless?\r\n\r\nThere needs to be a step by step guide added back to the docs, a guide that will get you from having nothing to running it in the browser instead of just links to other websites that don't have anything to do with react. I remember back in react 15, you could run through the guide and have a hello world app running within 10 minutes no problems, I have been trying to figure it out with these new docs for over an hour now and still 0 luck getting this running. The instructions used to actually be instructions, basically saying, install this, then that, then run this command in terminal, then do this and so on. The docs now just say, well you can use this, then has a link to a site that has nothing to do with react, there is not even any sort of instruction on the react website on what to do with that, just the link without any context around it. Can these docs please be reverted to the old versions or actually create a proper getting started page to get you from nothing to running?",
