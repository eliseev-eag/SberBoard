I'm inclined to do the latter since it means we can wash our hands of it. Our internal usage of `cx` is tied to our transforms so we've said no to features that would be useful to others outside FB. I'm concerned we'd do that again.\n\nAny suggestions for existing projects that we can point to?\n",
