This causes the focused input to be reset to the `defaultValue`, which won't be in sync with the tracked value because we do that work on blur for number inputs to avoid triggering validation warnings. This doesn't affect other input types, since the tracked value is updated immediately.\r\n\r\nThis might be a viable tradeoff for avoiding those validation warnings, so I'm not sure if this is actionable, but I wanted to at least document it for future reference.\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @nhunzaker @gaearon \r\n\r\n",
