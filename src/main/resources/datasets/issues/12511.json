Although, I do not get any error. It is running on chrome very slowly, and it does not show anything. \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI should see the main page. \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI am using react: \"react-dom\": \"^16.2.0\", \"react\": \"^16.2.0\",\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething I want to say is I have yarn-lock and package-lock.json. I am using bpm and yarn interchangeably. \r\n",
