They work fine after building/bundling.\r\n\r\n**Minimal example (proprietary software, can't paste full example**\r\n\r\nRoot class (where the context is defined)\r\n```js\r\nexport const UserContext = React.createContext();\r\n```\r\n```js\r\nrender() {\r\n    console.log(this.state.user);\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <UserContext.Provider value={this.state.user}>\r\n          {this.props.children}\r\n        </UserContext.Provider>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsumer file:\r\n```js\r\n<UserContext.Consumer>\r\n  {user => {\r\n    console.log(\"consumer\", user);\r\n    const { isLoggedIn, login, role } = user;\r\n    // Do stuff\r\n  }}\r\n</UserContext.Consumer>\r\n```\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen triggering changes to `this.state.user` (logout for example), the new state is updated and logged in the console.log at the beginning of the render, but **it does not propagate the change to the consumer** at all (i.e. the console.log in the consumer code, only gets executed once)\r\n\r\nThis **only happens in development**.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nThe above code has been **working perfectly** for months **until 16.5.2**.\r\n\r\nWhen we recently upgraded to **16.6.0, it stopped working only in development**, it works fine after building. (we use Webpack to build the bundle, no special configuration)\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\nNothing has changed at all in the dev/build configuration, nor anything in the provider/consumer codes.",
