  "body": "**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nthe docsearch on the new page changed its design, but two features are different than in the previous version: \r\n\r\n- the \"cursor\" no longer has a separate colour (visible when you use the arrow keys to select a result)\r\n- there no longer is an Algolia logo / mention\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n- A slightly different background colour for the cursor\r\n- A mention of \"search by Algolia\" or our logo, as which is required because it's a free plan. \r\n\r\nHappy to open a PR for both of those issues, with whatever colour / solution we choose\r\n\r\ncc @bvaughn and @gaearon \r\n",
