Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nI am a noob in react but this is bugging me and couldn't find any relevant examples online.\r\n\r\nOn checkbox onchange, I'm changing the state using setState like this- \r\n```\r\nhandleDeleteCheckboxChange=({ target }, id) => {\r\n    const { deleteMappings } = this.state;\r\n\r\n    const check = target.checked;\r\n    if (check === true) {\r\n      const addToExisting = deleteMappings;\r\n      addToExisting.push(id);\r\n      this.setState({ deleteMappings: addToExisting });\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n      const removeId = deleteMappings.filter(item => item !== id);\r\n      this.setState({ deleteMappings: removeId });\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSet state works but each time checkbox is changed, it takes a full second to two to get updated on the screen. I tried to remove setState and its fast. \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n",
