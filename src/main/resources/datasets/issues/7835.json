  "body": "So if I assign `onFocus` callback to `<input />` and then call method `focus()` on actual element, react won't fire `onFocus` event and related callback won't be called.\n\nIt's a problem of react, not DOM method `focus()`, because with `addEventListener('focus', fn)` it fire such an event.\n\nVersion is `15.3.2`\n\n**UPDATE**\nI called `this.refs.input.focus()` from `componentWillReceiveProps` which do not support firing such an events by design I think.\n",
