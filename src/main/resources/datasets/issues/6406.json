  "body": "Spiritual successor to https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5680.  This is a fix for #6119 and #6219, both of which are blocking v15. As an added bonus, it happens to also fix #4618 :P.  It works by setting/removing both the attribute and property for `value` on inputs, and setting the property for `defaultValue`.\n\nI fixed the tests to be more reasonable (inputs retain their initial value, rather than having the value potentially change when defaultValue changes). I also fixed the browser inconsistencies.\n",
