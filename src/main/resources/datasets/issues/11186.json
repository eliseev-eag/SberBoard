Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.\r\n2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.\r\n4. Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test`).\r\n5. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`npm run prettier`).\r\n6. Make sure your code lints (`npm run lint`).\r\n7. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) typechecks (`npm run flow`).\r\n8. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n",
