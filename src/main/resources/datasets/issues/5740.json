Figured I'd try to help the rest of the world, too!\n\nNew paragraph, for reference:\n\n> Note that `key` is not a prop; trying to access `this.props.key` from inside `ListItemWrapper.render` wil be undefined. If you need to access the same value within the child component, you should pass it as a different prop (ex: `<ListItemWrapper key={result.id} id={result.id} />`) While this may seem redundant, it's important to separate app logic from reconciling hints.\n",
