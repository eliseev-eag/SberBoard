  "body": "I'm finally updating my components from React.createClass() to ES6 classes, after seeing the [v15.5.0 deprecations][1]. The first error I'm seeing in my tests after running `jscodeshift -t react-codemod/transforms/class.js` is that some of my `sinon.stub()` calls are failing because my component methods are now in the ES7(?) property initializer syntax, i.e.\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Foo extends React.Component {\r\n  componentWillMount() {\r\n    this.fetchSomeData(this.props);\r\n  }\r\n  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {\r\n    if (nextProps.someProp !== this.props.someProp) {\r\n      this.fetchSomeData(nextProps);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  fetchSomeData = (props) => {\r\n    ...\r\n  };\r\n  render() {\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy question is: how can I stub `fetchSomeData()` using this new syntax? My tests looks like `sinon.stub(Foo.prototype, 'fetchSomeData');` which no longer works, assuming because `fetchSomeData()` isn't on the prototype anymore. I imagine the standard ES6 method syntax + a bunch of `.bind()` calls in the constructor would do the trick, but I'm just not a fan of that approach. I'd love to know if there's a solution with this syntax.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n(PS I posted this to stackoverflow but it seems like there's lots more discussion happening here than there these days. Sorry for the x-post ðŸ˜ƒ  )\r\n\r\n[1]: https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2017/04/07/react-v15.5.0.html#new-deprecation-warnings",
