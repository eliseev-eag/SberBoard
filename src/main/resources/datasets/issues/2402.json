  "body": "People lose hours of work debugging a simple issue: two versions of React being loaded at the same time.\n\nhttps://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/issues/32#issuecomment-60043061\nhttps://github.com/KyleAMathews/coffee-react-quickstart/issues/10#issuecomment-50655116\nhttps://github.com/gaearon/react-document-title/issues/1#issuecomment-60241045\nhttps://github.com/clayallsopp/react.backbone/issues/26\n\nBecause there is no warning right away when this happens, they usually discover the problem through invariant violations. Some of them are descriptive (e.g. `Uncaught Error: Invariant Violation: The handler for Route \"hello\" must be a valid React component`) and I think I even saw warning that said something like \"check if two copies of React are loaded\", but some are really cryptic: `Invariant Violation: addComponentAsRefTo(...): Only a ReactOwner can have refs...`.\n\nIs there a reason why we don't want to warn _right away_ when two copies of React are loaded?\n",
