  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nfeature\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\n\r\nWhen [developers](https://github.com/kentcdodds/dom-testing-library) want to watch for mutation of DOM nodes they need to use [MutationObserver](https://github.com/kentcdodds/dom-testing-library/blob/6e56bb0004998a796841f2d017c92fdecac6156c/src/wait-for-element.js#L49) API and it's [polyfill](https://github.com/megawac/MutationObserver.js/tree/master) that checks each observed element 30 times a second, which is not very performant.\r\n\r\nIdeally ReactDOM would have API that allows to execute callback each time DOM element is created / updated / removed in DOM) with list of mutations (just like MutationObserver#observe callback). Such observing of elements would be  more lightweight than polling for changes for each observed element.\r\n\r\nFeature request: MutationObserver API  for React-controlled DOM that doesn't use polling.\r\n\r\nThe API could be the same as [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver#Example):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport { MutationObserver } from 'react-dom';\r\nvar observer = new MutationObserver(callback);\r\nobserver.observe(ref)\r\nobserver.disconnect()\r\n```",
