  "body": "Conditional Rendering Components JSX-Control-Statement produces incorrect coverage in if / else branches. We are using it in our project and we want official Facebook's opinion about these as whether it will be updated with babel's AST for future support. If not please warn the developers that they will get incorrect branch coverage. See the reported issue below.\r\nhttps://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/issues/812\r\n\r\n1. Will facebook support any approach similar to JSX-Control-Statements in the future?\r\n1. If facebook does not support any approach like above, facebook should warn it's developers about using such library due to incorrect coverages.\r\n1. Issue consistent in jest and nyc since they both use babel's AST.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/AlexGilleran/jsx-control-statements\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nFeature(?)\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIncorrect Coverage\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nCorrect Coverage Report on custom conditional rendered components.\r\n\r\n",
