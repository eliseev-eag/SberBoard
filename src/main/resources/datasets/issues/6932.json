  "body": "We do this for classes but not for functional components, see https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/db6ac5c01c4ad669db7ca264bc81ae5b3d6dfa01/src/renderers/shared/stack/reconciler/ReactCompositeComponent.js#L1042-L1045\n\nThis leads to a lot of issues and confusion for people using Jest. I realize this is maybe not the greatest implementation ever, but since we support it for one but not the other, we should align the implementation and add this until we find a better way to deal with this.\n\nThis should be easy to add somewhere around here: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/6b1232aa86415f0573153888a46c4c5cb38974d8/src/renderers/shared/stack/reconciler/ReactCompositeComponent.js#L210\n\n@spicyj \n",
