  "body": "Say you have\n\n```\nlet myComp = React.createClass({\n  render: function() \n    return <input type=\"checkbox\"/>\n  } \n});\n```\n\nand myComp is rendered into the DOM. Then the user checks the checkbox. If you call myComp.render() now it seems as if the checkbox is stell checked even though this should re-render the checkbox. Where does this statefullness come from? Does react handle that? Maybe the input element has something like this.state.checked?\n\nI apologize if this is a question covered by the docs  (I suspect because it is somewhat basic) but I could not find information about it.\n",
