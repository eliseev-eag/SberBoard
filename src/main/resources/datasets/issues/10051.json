One of them is https://unpkg.com/airbnb-prop-types@2.7.0/build/helpers/getComponentName.js, for example.\r\n\r\nIt'd be ideal for the React team to maintain this package - primarily, so that it would be guaranteed to either not break when a new React version is released, or be updated to work with the upcoming version prior to release.\r\n\r\nIn the interests of the React team not signing up to maintain all the package requests that might come in, would it be possible to make \"part of the release process\" be \"ensure compatible versions of community packages exist\"? I'd be happy to create the above package, for example, and I know the community would love a guarantee that enzyme would always work with any official React version release, prior to the release.",
