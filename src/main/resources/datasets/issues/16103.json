  "body": "This PR tweaks the deprecated/unsafe lifecycle warnings.\r\n\r\n- redoes #15431 from scratch, taking on the feedback there\r\n- unifies the messaging between \"deprecated\" and UNSAFE_ lifecycle messages. It reorganises ReactStrictModeWarnings.js to capture and flush all the lifecycle warnings in one procedure each.\r\n- this DOES NOT do the above treatment for context warnings, I'll do that in another PR too\r\n- matches the warning from ReactPartialRenderer to match the above treatment\r\n- passes all the tests\r\n- this also turns on `warnAboutDeprecatedLifecycles` for the test renderer. I think we missed doing so it previously. In a future PR, I'll remove the feature flag altogether.\r\n\r\nThings to do in future PRs asap - \r\n- give a similar treatment to legacy context warnings \r\n- make a docs page on reactjs.org that take the recommendations from https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/27/update-on-async-rendering.html, and adds a section on the codemod.\r\n- polish the codemod experience \r\n\r\nScreenshot: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18808/61232541-7086f780-a726-11e9-815c-069717e6aa16.png)\r\n\r\n",
