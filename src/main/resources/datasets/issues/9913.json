  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nUndocumented breaking change for IE11\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nStarting `react-addons-update` v15.5 the package has been changed from depending on an internal file from the `react` package (`react/lib/update.js`) to actually include the full implementation.\r\n\r\nWhile the internal implementation depended on the `object-assign` polyfill, the external one actually calls `Object.assign` directly, breaking support with IE 11.\r\n\r\n- [`react-addons-update@15.4.2`](https://unpkg.com/react-addons-update@15.4.2)\r\n- [`react@15.4.2/lib/update.js`](https://unpkg.com/react@15.4.2/lib/update.js)\r\n- [`react-addons-update@15.2.2`](https://unpkg.com/react-addons-update@15.5.2)\r\n\r\nThis requires users that support IE11 to polyfill `Object.assign`. This was not mentioned in the [release blog post of React 15.5](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2017/04/07/react-v15.5.0.html#react-addons).\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\n\r\nâ€“\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nAdd a mention of this to the release blog post.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 15.5+. Worked fine in React 15.4.",
