  "body": "Fixes #231\n\nThere's still a bunch of work to do, but the important things pretty much just work!\n\nThis depends on a couple things, namely that we release a react-source v0.4.1 with #217. I built that locally and installed it so I could test.\n\nThis is another thing that I would like to pull out of the react repo and publish independently, but for the time being this lets us move fast. I may actually just do that before this is ready to merge in anyway...\n",
