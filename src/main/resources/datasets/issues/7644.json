  "body": "This commit takes the first incremental step towards adding type checks\nto the event code. A couple of issues came up.\n\nThere is an issue with the SyntheticEvent type: [Flow declares a\nSyntheticEvent type](https://github.com/facebook/flow/blob/master/lib/react.js#L277-L293) that lacks the non-public properties which are\nused in React internals. To solve this I declared a class that extends\nSyntheticEvent. This class can be expanded as we add Flow types to more\nplaces where SyntheticEvent instances are referenced.\n\nI'm happy to change this if folks prefer a different approach.\nSome options I considered:\n- Override the SyntheticEvent declaration with our own declaration\n  - Pro: We can use 'SyntheticEvent' as a type just like we are used to\n    when working in any other codebase.\n  - Pro: No need to import any type since it's a declaration\n  - Pro: Only one version of SyntheticEvent; less confusion.\n  - Con: Could get out of sync with real implementation.\n  - Con: Duplicates part of the type declared in Flow.\n- Import the SyntheticEvent class and use that as the type\n  - Pro: Keeps type definition in sync with the real implementation.\n  - Con: Declaration overrides implementation so I'm not sure this would\n    work.\n  - Con: Have to remember to import the type.\n- Declare a separate type called ReactSyntheticEvent that extends\n  SyntheticEvent\n  - Pro: Stays in sync with the Flow SyntheticEvent type;\n    less duplication.\n  - Pro: Differentiates this type from the Flow SyntheticEvent type;\n    less confusion.\n  - Pro: No need to import any type since it's a declaration\n  - Con: Could get out of sync with real implementation.\n\nI also ran into an issue where a variable was only non-null when\n'**DEV**' is true, similar to [PR #7586](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7586/commits/b99eb5087bc2df3bcb64d76a2d75953978f61f34). The work-around is to force\nit to be typed non-null and add a comment documenting the reason. At\nthis time Flow doesn't have a better way to deal with the situation.\n\nNext steps:\n- Specific type for the 'dispatchConfig' property of SyntheticEvent\n- More detailed types for PluginName and PluginModule\n\nLastly; note that I renamed some variables to follow the convention of\nreserving PascalCase for classes, enums, and Flow types.\n",
