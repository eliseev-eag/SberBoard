  "body": "After upgrading to React 15.0.1 or 15.1.0 I'm not able to use printWasted from Perf tools.\n\nReact 15.0.1 throws error:\n`ReactDefaultPerfAnalysis.js:177 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'forEach' of undefined(â€¦)`\n\nReact 15.1.0\n`warning.js:44 Warning: There is an internal error in the React performance measurement code. We did not expect componentDidMount timer to stop while no timer is still in progress for another instance. Please report this as a bug in React`\n\nI discovered that error is connected with returning `null`. A lot of my components have something like that\n\n```\nrender: function() {\n  if (!this.props.visible) {\n    return null;\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nAnd when I try to measure one of those components I will get above error. Removing conditions from components fixes problem.\n",
