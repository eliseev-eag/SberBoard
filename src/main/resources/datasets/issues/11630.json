  "body": "Fixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11618.\r\n\r\nIt's confusing to have two different code paths due to throwing in DEV but not in PROD. We try to avoid such cases.\r\n\r\nI found these two as I was working on https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11616.\r\n\r\nThey were introduced accidentally in https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/4d8174480c6daa2ec49a932b54705d73ba40a398. In the past they would always run.\r\n\r\nI thought about moving them out of the `__DEV__` block but then figured there's no real need to run those extra checks in production. (We didn't for a few months anyway.) In particular it's nice to not run `isArray` checks for every single state object.\r\n\r\nSo we might as well turn them into warnings and keep them DEV-only.\r\n\r\n**Note: if we merge this, weâ€™ll need to enable these warnings on next sync.**",
