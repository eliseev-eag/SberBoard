  "body": "Would it be possible to expose some counters from the rendering vdom diff algorithm resulting dom operations when in development mode?\n\nReact does a really good job at running fast but it's still entirely possible for human error to thwart it's algorithms; as well as human ignorance (from it being fast enough to hide our bad code) to lead to poor performance in the long term. \n\nWhile this can generally be visible when it's really really bad, it would be nice to have an interface that sends back an object with counters every time it touches the dom to fully satisfy a diff. They would only be counters, isolated per `React.render(node, dom)` and wouldn't reset, the user would be responsible for subtracting previous values (just like one would do when measuring fps in a animation loop).\n\n**Example Use Case**: I press a button, visually only some text changes and a field appears but the counters indicate several DOM nodes were created along with various other operations. Then I would know that either (a) I'm doing something horribly wrong (b) I'm not doing something wrong but there's likely a much more efficient way to do it. Assuming the counters reflect back what we actually think should happen then they would just be a nice check rendering is doing well (or at least as good as we think it should).\n",
