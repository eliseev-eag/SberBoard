However, it doesn't do that when you use spread operator in validation function.\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\r\n\r\nMinimal demo: https://jsfiddle.net/uxc9pwd9/1/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nBoth components from them example should throw a warning.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nI see this issue on version 15.3.2 on Chrome. I don't think it's browser related. I don't know if it has worked in the past.",
