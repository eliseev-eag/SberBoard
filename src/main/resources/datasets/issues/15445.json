Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nusing **React.lazy(() => import('../Calendar/index'))** instead of **lazyComponent(() => import('../Calendar/index')).**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nReact.lazy(() => import('../Calendar/index')) should work fine as i've checked for the presence of required Webpack setup and babel plugin.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI encounter this issue in React 16.6. i've never used React.lazy before.\r\nWebpack and Babel files:  [my webpack and babel configuration](https://gist.github.com/adityaloshali/9b6a4713afa6fa2ab1d4c3f0b74ed2a9)",
