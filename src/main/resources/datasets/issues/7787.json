  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\n_bug_\n**What is the current behavior?**\nI have built a react web app using React + Redux that is being rendered in a webview. I have a long paginated list to be rendered. It shows a flickering kind of behaviour in loading the UI when I scroll up or down on that page. When I scroll too fast, it takes a second or two to render the UI properly. Also, this problem is found in the Android webview only but not on browser.\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\nHere's the link of the screencast I recorded [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9fJ9q7WyHl4NWljQ0NKclBCM3c](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9fJ9q7WyHl4NWljQ0NKclBCM3c)\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nThere's shouldn't be any flickering while scrolling be it webview or browser.\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\"react\": \"^15.1.0\"\n\"redux\": \"^3.5.2\"\n\nAndroid Webview\n",
