  "body": "Currently React looks for `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__` global and calls `inject` on it, if it exists. This works fine if there's one listener (e.g. Chrome React DevTools themselves).\n\nI'd love it if React supported arbitrary number of independent hooks. In [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) I'm reaching into internals (I need `ReactMount` to [get all mounted instances](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/blob/master/DefaultRootInstanceProvider.js#L5)) but I wish I could do that without `require`-ing an internal module.\n\nIdeally I wish React exposed the same modules that are available to global hooks, via some kind of `React.registerDeveloperTool()`. This would be called automatically for `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__` but available on `React` object if I want to do it from a library. (I don't mean production libraries, but debugging aid libraries such as React Hot Loader and potentially others.)\n",
