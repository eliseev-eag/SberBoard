  "body": "There are some inconsistencies regarding the use of **renderToStaticMarkup**\r\n\r\nCurrent documentation says that  :\r\n\r\n> Similar to renderToString, except this doesn't create extra DOM attributes such as data-reactid, that React uses internally. This is useful if you want to use React as a simple static page generator, as stripping away the extra attributes can save lots of bytes.\r\n\r\nBut on release 15.0 there is a statement that suggests : \r\n\r\n> **data-reactid** is no longer on every node. As a result of using document.createElement, we can prime the node cache as we create DOM nodes, allowing us to skip a potential lookup (which used the data-reactid attribute). Root nodes will have a data-reactroot attribute and **_server generated markup will still contain data-reactid_**.\r\n\r\nI was looking to optimize the server render content by removing all that extra markup, and thought I was doing something wrong because there are still a lot of **data-reactid** everywhere, \r\nso, _**Is it still possible to render on the server without those extra dom attributes**_?",
