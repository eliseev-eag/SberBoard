  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen a error boundary components catches error and we do a setState, the refs in forwardRef break. I have attached an image where this error occurs at the bottom of this post to assist.\r\n\r\nI struggled to find the root of the problem and we have an internal task open to try and fix the code if possible and make a PR for React. I could not find the same code as what shows in screenshot. I am probably not understanding the code right.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nForwardRef should work with our components like expected.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nAfter checking our package.json, it seems we are using a alpha version of React. The people on my team updated to this version of React last week due to a bug fix that it has. I'm not sure how stable this version is but there seems to be an issue with forwardRef API. It does not happen on the previous version. Maybe this bug has been fixed in the next version?\r\n\r\nI already report this bug on React discord channel and someone told me to open issue here. Thank you for your help.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/6d5d250bef88115ceceb906d0cab1d60ea996d7b/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L212",
