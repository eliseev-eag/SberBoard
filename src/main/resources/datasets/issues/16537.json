I have a typical Context provider that stored it's state values using `useReducer`\r\n2. In a leaf component where I'm consuming that context, I have an effect that does some async code and then sets state in the context (setState function passed down through context)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction ShoppingPage() {\r\n  const { shoppingCartState } = useContext(Context);\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    getShoppingCartStuff().then(shoppingCartState.setCart);\r\n  }, []);\r\n  // I later added [shoppingCartState.setCart] to the dep array. See comments below\r\n\r\n  return <div>Cart: {shoppingCartState.cart}</div>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Recently I added the \"exhaustive-deps\" lint rules and caught that I wasn't adding `shoppingCartState.setCart` to that dep array. So I added it and started getting an infinite loop. My thought process was `shoppingCartState` must be getting a new identity in memory. \r\n4. After exploring for a while, I decided to change the state of the context to use `useState` and the infinite loop went away.\r\n\r\nSo just to be clear, the state in context being managed with `useState` or `useReducer` doesn't cause an infinite loop until I add that dep array value for `shoppingCartState.setCart`, then `useReducer` causes a loop and `useState` doesn't\r\n\r\nExample with both `useState` and `useReducer` versions\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/competent-boyd-yzzyh\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nHopefully no loop\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.8 and 16.9 tested",
