  "body": "So, I would be quite surprised if this is an actual bug, since it would probably have been reported long ago, but in that case I think the documentation can be made more clear, because I cannot interpret the documentation of `Children.toArray` in any other way than that it is supposed to return all children (including nested ones) as a flat array. \n\n**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\n\nbug (or unclear documentation)\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\n\n`Children.toArray(this.props.children)` does not return a flat array. (or rather returns a flat array, but only including direct children (not nested ones))\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\n\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/9p6yq3bq/\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n\nfor `Children.toArray(this.props.children)` to return a flat array of all children including nested ones\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\n`\"react\": \"^15.0.2\"`\n\n[documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#react.children.toarray)\n\n> Return the children opaque data structure as a flat array with keys assigned to each child. \n\n[release notes from when the API was made public](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html)\n\n> Added React.Children.toArray which takes _a nested children object and returns a flat array_ [emphasis added] with keys assigned to each child. This helper makes it easier to manipulate collections of children in your render methods, especially if you want to reorder or slice this.props.children before passing it down. In addition, React.Children.map now returns plain arrays too.\n",
