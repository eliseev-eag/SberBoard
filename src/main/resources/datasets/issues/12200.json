In React 16 there does not seem to be a way to specify no `<option>` gets selected by default\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/moxm2on3z9\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIn React 15 unless you marked an option to be selected `<option selected>` no options were selected by default.\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/ll11z5wqzl\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nVersions effected include `react^16.2`, this worked in `react^0.13` and `react^15`. This bug is reproducible in chrome 64 and Firefox 58.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe hacky workaround I found to get around the first option getting selected is to inject a `<option style={{display: 'none'}} />` as the first child of the multiselect.",
