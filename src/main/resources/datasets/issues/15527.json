Maybe I'm just running into a weird edge case.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI have a situation where using a combination of `useEffect`, `useCallback`, and having a function in the actual component render is causing a sort of memory leak.\r\nThe current render of the component seems to hang on to references of past renders of the component. (more details in the reproduction sample repo)\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.**\r\n\r\nI think I have this minimized about as much as I can:\r\nhttps://github.com/rally25rs/react-mem\r\n\r\nIt's a basic `create-react-app` project, so you can just `yarn install && yarn start` it. There is some explanation/instructions in the web page that it renders.\r\n\r\nThe `src/VirtualizedTable.js` file is the key file to look at.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nAs best as my brain can comprehend, memoized references should be getting cleared as the component props change and data should be garbage collected (but it isn't).\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n* Chrome\r\n* react@16.8.6\r\n",
