  "body": "I would like to propose to add a `walkTree` method in React. Today a lot of libraries relies on walking the React tree for SSR. It is used to preload data, styles or whatever.\r\n\r\nI am asking because I found a [bug in Loadable Components](https://github.com/smooth-code/loadable-components/pull/65) and I fixed it, but [the bug is also in React Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/issues/1937) and probably in other libraries that use this strategy.\r\n\r\nI have several questions:\r\n\r\n- Is `walkTree` the good strategy? If not can you tell me how to do it?\r\n- If `walkTree` is the good strategy, could you maintain it and expose it in React or another package?",
