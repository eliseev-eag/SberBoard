  "body": "When a component is rendering, it is free to return whatever it wants given its props (including children). One thing it may want to do is mutate an input component instance, including attaching a ref.\n\nWhat are best practices wrt modifying component instances that are passed in (either via props or children)?\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/paulshen/S773F/\nIn this fiddle, it seems reasonable if both `Parent` and `Child` want to be owners of the content. Although `Parent` is the original owner/creator, `Child` has full control of the output when it is rendering.\n\nIdeally, I would expect React to support the ability for both `Parent` and `Child` to access the same component via refs. It seems like multiple owners/refs is a reasonable solution?\n",
