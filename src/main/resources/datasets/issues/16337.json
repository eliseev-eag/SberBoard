  "body": "I have seen that componentWillMount  is going to be deprectaed with React 17. However my state management slution hardly relays on it because during this call component is not still visible but i have access to props already so i can bind to appropriate store. \r\nThere is not an option neither constructor neither componentDidMount because I have render errors already since dom tries to get values from store.\r\n\r\nAnd only reason explanation i see in every blogpost i see - people are not using it wrongly with async rendering by fetching remote data in it. I think this is developes problem that he does not understand how it works...\r\n\r\nAny suggestions how to solve this?\r\n",
