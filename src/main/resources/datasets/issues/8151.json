Relax a test that insists on `refs` being cleared before render\n\nI'm actually not sure if (3) is correct so I want to talk about this new behavior. If we don't clear refs before rendering, people can potentially rely on (stale) refs in render. In fact I've seen this pattern quite a bit in our layer code even with the old reconciler. Can/should we completely clear refs before calling render?\n",
