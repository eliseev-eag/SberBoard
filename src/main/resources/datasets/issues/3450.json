  "body": "I'm somehow a fulltime CoffeeScript programmer.\nHere's what I found in 0.13 beta release post:\nhttp://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/01/27/react-v0.13.0-beta-1.html\n\n``` coffee\ndiv = React.createFactory 'div'\n\nclass Counter extends React.Component\n  @propTypes = initialCount: React.PropTypes.number\n  @defaultProps = initialCount: 0\n\n  constructor: (props) ->\n    super props\n    @state = count: props.initialCount\n\n  tick: =>\n    @setState count: @state.count + 1\n\n  render: ->\n    div onClick: @tick,\n      'Clicks: '\n      @state.count\n```\n\nWhile it's exciting I got some questions on using static properties:\n\n`propTypes` and `defaultProps` are becoming static properties, and `state` is now a property defined in the constructor. And this is even more clear in the ES6 demo.\n\n``` js\nexport class Counter extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {count: props.initialCount};\n  }\n  tick() {\n    this.setState({count: this.state.count + 1});\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div onClick={this.tick.bind(this)}>\n        Clicks: {this.state.count}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\nCounter.propTypes = { initialCount: React.PropTypes.number };\nCounter.defaultProps = { initialCount: 0 };\n```\n\nI found these are not updated in the 0.13 docs, but would like to talk more about them. Which properties are influenced? Which syntax do you recommend? Fat arrow or not?\n",
