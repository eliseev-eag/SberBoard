  "body": "NormalizedEventListener uses Object.create which is unavailable in IE8 and isn't added by es5-shim. (edit: no longer.)\n\nIt _is_ [added by es5-sham](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim/blob/master/es5-sham.js#L153) but the common questions doc on the React site doesn't say that es5-sham is also required. Not sure if this is a docs problem or if there's a good way to avoid Object.create.\n\n(Side note: it's a little bit of a pain to test in IE8 since neither the website nor most of the examples include es5-shim (or es5-sham).)\n",
