  "body": "A production only warning for having propTypes defined as a non-empty object could spark a change in the community to have propTypes conditional on NODE_ENV. This could be automated with a babel plugin, or similar for other build systems.\n\nThis would result in all react apps being significantly smaller in production.\n\n> Warning: you have defined propTypes on the {ComponentName} component in a production build. If this is your own code, consider using a plugin such as babel-plugin-{plugin-name}. If it's a third party library, open an issue.\n\nOr alternative save-all-bytes text.\n\n> Warning: propTypes defined on {ComponentName} http://fb.me/react-prod-proptypes\n",
