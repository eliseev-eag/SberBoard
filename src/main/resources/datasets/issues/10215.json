  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIf a component's render method throws an error, it leaves React in an inconsistent state.\r\nSubsequent renders attempt to update the inconsistent component and result in errors like \"Cannot read property 'getHostNode' of null\".\r\n\r\n**Proposed behavior**\r\n\r\nReact could catch the error from the render method, set an \"inconsistent state\" flag and re-throw it.\r\nAfterwards, if React is about to update the previously rendered component, but this flag is set, it could discard or unmount the existing component and perform a fresh render, as if the container were empty.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?**\r\n\r\nI've encountered the inconsistent state problems in 15.5 and 15.6",
