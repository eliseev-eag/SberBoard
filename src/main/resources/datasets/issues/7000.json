There is no manual curation here and the tool isn't complete, but I can say confidently that this would be a minor release.\n\nActual plan for releasing this:\n- [ ] triple check that all the PRs that should be here are, will require another triage pass, will possibly re-run entire process.\n- [ ] revert part of #6859 (for the valid element check)\n- [ ] close this PR without merging, instead push 15-dev branch (or maybe call it 15-next to match the milestone)\n- [ ] update milestone for all cherry-picked PRs to ensure we don't get mixed up with other things that might get merged targeted for another version\n- [ ] bump the version\n- [ ] ship as 15.2.0-rc.1 (or alpha?)\n  (this part is interesting - if we picked up more changes we would only change the prerelease part of the version, even if it's a semver-bump-required change)\n- [ ] make sure tests pass\n",
