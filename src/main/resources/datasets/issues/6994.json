This is far too expensive for our use case. To put this number in perspective, CPUs nowadays execute roughly 3 billion instructions per second. So even with the most performant implementation, we wouldn't be able to compute that diff in less than a second.\n\nConsidering it mentions that CPUs execute **3 billion** per second while we require **1 billion** comparisons, why it come to a conclusion that we **wouldn't be able to compute the task in less than a second**? \n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n\nI guess the expected behavior would be either provide the correct CPUs time or update the conclusion.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\nIt's a documentation bug.\n",
