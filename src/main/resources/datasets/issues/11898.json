  "body": "~~Spying on `console.error` or `console.warn` will now fail tests by default, with an error suggesting the use of the new `toWarnDev` matcher instead.~~ (This has been removed.)\r\n\r\nUpdated `.toWarnDev()` matcher to report a failed expectation to Jest even if an `Error` was thrown by its callback. Giving precedence to failed expectations prevents a thrown error from potentially masking failed expectations (and removes a source of potential false-positives from our tests).\r\n\r\nAs of this point, all but 2 of our tests have been updated to the new matcher:\r\n* `ReactIncrementalErrorLogging-test.internal`: There's one test case that I'm unsure of how to update. I'll look at it again tomorrow.\r\n* `ReactDOMServerIntegrationTestUtils`: It's possible to update this test util but it will take time since several, procedurally-generated tests use it. For the time being, I've added a TODO comment for following up on it.\r\n  ",
