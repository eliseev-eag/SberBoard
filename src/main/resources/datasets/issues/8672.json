  "body": "This is a **bug**\r\n\r\n**Current behavior**\r\n\r\nCalling `this.setState` multiple times only re-renders the component once, the value of `nextState` (inside `shouldComponentUpdate` which is also called once only) is equal to value passed to `setState` on the first call.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n`shouldComponentUpdate` is called each time `this.setState` is called & the component re-renders if it returns true.\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n\r\nI'm building a library that wraps components & does some state management stuff, the code is similar to `react-redux`. While working on the context feature I created a BMI calculator to help debug issues. The VDOM for that example looks like this:\r\n\r\n![vdom](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6740947/21599657/2978f19a-d168-11e6-94a6-9498a9277471.png)\r\n\r\nChanging the input value should cause the `BMICalculatorUsingContext` & `Input` to both re-render, but the `Input` doesn't. After some investigation I discovered `this.setState` is called several times inside `Mirror(Input)`, (with the expected values), however `shouldComponentUpdate` is not called as expected:\r\n\r\n![console log](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6740947/21599718/2cbf46d2-d169-11e6-9e4a-942c55441faa.png)\r\n\r\nTo workaround this issue I checked for failures inside the `setState` callback, & re-called `setState` if required. Obviously this is not ideal:\r\n\r\n```\r\nthis.setState({state, context}, () => {\r\n  if (this.state.state !== state || this.state.context !== context) {\r\n    setTimeout(() => {\r\n      this.setState({state, context})\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n**How to replicate**\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ashtonwar/react-mirror.git\r\ncd react-mirror\r\ngit reset --hard b2f4ea539745c770f099666bac8c8557d8f5a601\r\nyarn install\r\ncd examples/BMICalculator\r\nyarn install\r\nyarn start\r\n```\r\n\r\nGo to `http://localhost:3000` & change the input value.\r\n\r\nWhile trying to re-create this issue in a simpler example I speculated calling `this.setState` inside the parent immediately before calling `this.setState` inside the child caused the problem. Though this idea was incorrect as the child correctly re-rendered & `render` was called every time `this.setState` was called. You can see this attempt [here](https://github.com/ashtonwar/setStateTest).\r\n\r\n**Using**\r\n\r\nReact 15, Windows 7, Chrome 55",
