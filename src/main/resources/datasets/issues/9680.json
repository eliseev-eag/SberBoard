  "body": "See this fiddle (using chrome): https://jsfiddle.net/gmodvajk/2/\r\n\r\n## The bug\r\n\r\nThis is just a small problem that occurs under very specific conditions. The fiddle shows a scrollable box where half-way down the color of the box is changed from a solid color to a semi-transparent color. When scrolling down (and only down) you will see that it seems to get a little stuck on the way. It becomes much more apparent when using the page down key, where it'll only scroll until the color-change point, and no further, even on repeated pushes of page down. Page up (or going from a semi-transparent color to a solid color) works just fine\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWhen scrolling it shouldn't hitch at the color-changing point. When pushing page down it's supposed to scroll the box all the way.\r\n\r\n## Recreating the bug\r\n\r\nThe container must be positioned absolute or relative, and it must have a z-index set. This problem only occurs when going from a solid color to any rgba color (where alpha isn't 1).\r\n\r\n## Enviorment\r\n\r\nThis was tested on Fedora-Linux and on Windows 10. The behavior only seems to occur in chrome. In firefox it works fine.\r\nReact version 15.5.4\r\n",
