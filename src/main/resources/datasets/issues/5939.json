  "body": "The title is an assumption based on my experience upgrading. Here's an example of what I'm seeing:\n\n``` js\nconst App = React.createClass({\n  getInitialState() {\n    return {clicked: 0}\n  },\n  handleClick(e) {\n    console.log('e.target before callback is null?', e.target === null) // e.target is not null here\n    this.setState({\n      clicked: this.state.clicked + 1\n    }, () => {\n      console.log('e.target after callback is null?', e.target === null) // e.target is null here\n    })\n  },\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div\n        onClick={this.handleClick}\n      >\n        Click me {this.state.clicked}\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))\n```\n\nHere's a jsbin that demonstrates the behavior with `0.14.6`: https://jsbin.com/gasozit/edit?js,console,output\n\nHere's a jsbin with `0.14.7`: https://jsbin.com/vaberi/edit?js,console,output\n\nNotice in the console, that the log inside the callback is logging that `e.target === null` evaluates to `true`. In my app, I'm passing the `event` to an `onChange` handler which utilizes the `target`. So this update breaks that situation.\n\nThis may or may not be a bug. It may just be necessary for avoiding the memory leak. If that's the case, then it's a support request :smile: How should I handle this if I'm passing the `event` to another callback and I want that event to have references to things like `target`?\n",
