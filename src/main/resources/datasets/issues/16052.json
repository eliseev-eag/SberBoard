  "body": "I am trying to make my app use nested React routers to navigate through my app but am not managing to do the following: I have a router to switch between the login page and the homepage and a router in the homepage to switch between the body content \r\n\r\n1. Return to login page on clicking log out. If i click logout the url goes to /login but does not render the right component. Upon refreshing the page the right component is rendered. \r\n\r\n2. When inputing a direct page in the url eg. localhost:3000/about, the page doesn't load anything\r\n\r\nMy desired functionality is the following: \r\n1. On load of localhost:3000/ - If user is logged in it loads the \"About\" component ELSE if user is logged out it is redirected to /login\r\n2. On load of localhost:3000/contact - If user is logged in it loads the homepage and switches the body content to show the contact component , if user is logged out it redirects to the login page but on login takes the user to the contact component \r\n3. Clicking log out returns to the login component \r\n\r\nI have added the source code here: https://codesandbox.io/embed/loving-engelbart-x3ns3\r\nThe first router is in App/App.jsx and the body content router is in _pages/HomePage.jsx\r\nUnfortunately i had to remove the login authentication so the login does not work but maybe there is a clear issue with my code that can be outlined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks",
