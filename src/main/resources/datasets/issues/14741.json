This is preventing the script from loading the causes the page to stop loading, only displaying the word `loading` in the dom. \r\n\r\nThis seems to be limited to my computer, my coworker's computers can still access graphiql.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nTried visiting our webapp where graphiql is supposed to be loaded from our react-based webapp.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nExpected behavior is the page loads with the graphiql interface.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nThis stopped working yesterday (1/30/19). Running Macbook Pro, 10.14.3 (18D42), Chrome (Version 72.0.3626.81 (Official Build) (64-bit)).
