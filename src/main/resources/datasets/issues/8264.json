  "body": "I've discovered what seems like a platform bug in the Opera Browser (Presto Engine) which is causing server side rendered components to always be re-rendered because the client's checksum does not match the server rendered checksum.\r\n\r\nMore than 3 addition assignment expressions in a single statement results in an incorrect checksum when the adler32 function is called.\r\n\r\nHere is a test case that can be used to reproduce the bug:\r\n\r\nhttps://jsbin.com/yukefox/1/edit?html,output\r\n\r\nHere is a download link for Opera 12.16 for Mac you could install and run the above test and see it fail:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.opera.com/download/guide/?ver=12.16\r\n\r\nWhile it's a very old browser, and a fix for it extremely unlikely, it's still used on many embedded devices (TiVo being one where I'm finding it).  \r\n\r\nHowever, React can work around the bug by splitting this line in the adler32 function into multiple statements:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/shared/utils/adler32.js#L31\r\n\r\n\r\n",
