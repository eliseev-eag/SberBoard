  "body": "Fixes an issue where `performWorkOnRoot` was called, but `nextFlushedRoot` was not set. This happened in a special branch where we synchronously flush newly mounted DOM trees outside the normal work loop.\r\n\r\nArguably, `performWorkOnRoot` should read from the globally assigned root and expiration time instead of accepting arguments, since those arguments are expected to be the same as the global values, anyway. I decided against that since the global values could be null, so reading from them would require extra null checks.",
