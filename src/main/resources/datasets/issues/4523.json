  "body": "As seen here (https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/ReactNative/ReactNativeMount.js#L86)\n\n\"As soon as `ReactMount` is refactored to not rely on the DOM, we can share code between the two. For now, we'll hard code the ID logic.\"\n\nIs this still wanted? I'm working on a project where it would help if ReactMount was not dependant on the DOM as it has a different render target. I don't mind taking a look at doing this, but I just want to check if it's a wanted feature or whether in cases like mine I should just go about writing a completely new renderer.\n\nI think it would be useful as it would make it easier to use React for projects which aren't DOM related.\n",
