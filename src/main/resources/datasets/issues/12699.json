  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nNot 100% sure, but might be a bug (or just something I'm not doing right). Everything seems to indicate this should work, so that is why I'm thinking a potential bug possibly...?\r\n\r\nBeen trying to get assistance from Stack Overflow, but not getting anywhere:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/50032041/react-component-loses-formatting-related-to-classname-when-printing-triggered-fr\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/30135387/how-to-print-react-component-on-click-of-a-button/?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nTrying to print content that is in a modal, but external styles (via `className`) are not being passed to it when the print dialog preview is up. However, when done in line (e.g., `style={{ color: 'red' }}`) the styles are reflected.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nI have a repo of use case with directions. I'll work on migrating it to JSFiddle or CodeSandbox if that is better.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ishraqiyun77/react-print-iframe-issue\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI should still see the styles being applied when using external CSS via `className` when going to print.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.2.0, using Chrome 65.0.3325.181 on Windows 10.0.16299.371 and WSL. Not sure if it worked in previous versions as I have just started on this feature of the web app.",
