  "body": "Fixed a but that happens when in certain cases when a state change decides a node and it's parent should be removed, because of timing issues (I think) it can happen that updatedChildren[j] is undefined when trying to remove itself from the parentNode.\n\nI ran all tests and lint (which gave error's but not related to this pull request and tested the fix on our own code. I don't have a specific test case for this because I don't know how to trigger this scenario, but I assume this piece of code is already covered pretty well. If a specific test is required I am happy to do so with some guidance on how to trigger this behaviour without copying our own code :-) \n\nA local fix is that instead of removing the child node I hide it instead, or applying this pull request.\n",
