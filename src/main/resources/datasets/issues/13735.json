Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nWe are using `import { findDOMNode } from 'react-dom'` in one of our components and the server render is broken due to this dependency/file being pulled in.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nTo not error, I guess. The root problem seems to be a faulty check of environment somewhere.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThis has been narrowed down to just 16.5.2 -- doing nothing but downgrading to 16.5.1 using `npm install --save react@16.5.1 react-dom@16.5.1` fixes the issue.\r\n",
