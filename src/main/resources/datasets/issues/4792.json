  "body": "I am seeing an issue where large numbers take a long time to render.\n\nI almost don't believe it's happening, but there seems to be a worse-than-linear increase in render time as I add digits to numbers.\n\nFormatting as string first seems to fix the problem.\n\nI tried to build a fiddle to exemplify the issue, but I think it's exacerbated by being pretty far down the DOM tree.\n\nDoesn't seem to matter where in the app I do it; if numbers aren't formatted, and get to be 10+ digits, it takes seconds for the render to finish.\n\nLet me know if you can't reproduce, and I will try to carve out an example app. Just try setting some component in a \"real\" app to something like `<span>{123456789.1234}</span>`, this seems to be enough to slow it down for me.\n",
