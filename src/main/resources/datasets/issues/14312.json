  "body": "Fixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14310 and adds regression tests.\r\n\r\nIt was broken for two reasons:\r\n\r\n* `SimpleMemoComponent` didn't resolve outer default props, but we only checked for presence of inner default props before upgrading. This was fixed by adding an extra check.\r\n* `MemoComponent` didn't resolve outer default props either. This was fixed by adding an extra resolve step for the outer type.\r\n\r\nThe regression test verifies that default props don't get lost, and also verifies that we resolve default props in the correct order when we have both inner and outer ones.\r\n\r\nThe reason `memo()` is unique in this regard is because it is represented as one fiber, but `defaultProps` can be on both sides of the type.",
