  "body": "Hello,\nI wanted to add two another components under one so I did something like\n\n```\nReact.createClass({\n    InsideComponent: React.createClass({ ... })\n});\n```\n\nAnd used it like this:\n\n```\n<this.InsideComponent />\n```\n\nWhich didn't work and required me to use React.createFactory (message `Something is calling a React component directly. ...`). So I tried something like:\n\n```\nReact.createClass({\n    InsideComponent: React.createFactory(React.createClass({ ... }))\n});\n```\n\nWhich works fine, however, when I wanted to add children like this:\n\n```\n<this.InsideComponent>\n    <child_a />\n    <child_b />\n</this.InsideComponent>\n```\n\nAnd reference them using `this.props.children` it didn't work. I got message `Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {}). ...` logged in console they looked like this:\n\n![children](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12086263/13463683/be87da34-e08d-11e5-8129-99cb107d5141.png)\n\nSo I went through react code and find `autobind`. I set it to false and now everything works correctly, however I guess, there will be problems with that approach in future, because I belive autobinding is useful or, will be useful somewhere else in my outer component.\n\nIs it bug or am I doing something wrong?\nThank you\n",
