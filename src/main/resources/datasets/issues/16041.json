  "body": "(basically, when `fiber.mode !== 0b0000`)\r\n\r\nWarnings on unacted effects may be too noisy, especially for legacy apps. This PR fires the warning only when in a non sync mode (concurrent/batched), or when in strict mode. This should make gradually updating codebases easier too.\r\n\r\nI also added batched mode tests to the act() suite.",
