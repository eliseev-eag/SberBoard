  "body": "Following on from #9757, the purpose of this PR is to remove the few remaining React.PropTypes references.\r\nI have only found a few occurrences in the doc and the warnings messages in the tests so it is only of minor importance.\r\n\r\nCommits related to the live editor and the \"warning\" page have been tested by running the documentation in local.\r\n\r\nCommit related to the warning sentences in the tests is more problematic because it breaks the tests if the warning message in the [prop-types](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types) library is not updated as well.\r\nIf it is acceptable, another option would be to only test the beginning of the warning message.\r\nI am unsure but I also guess that the _scripts/error-codes/codes.json_ file should be regenerated.\r\nSo maybe this last commit could be excluded from the PR, because given these constraints it may not be worth it.\r\n",
