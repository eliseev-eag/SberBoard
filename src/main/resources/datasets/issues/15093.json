  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n- maybe bug?\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nMy case is that I want to update state n times by adding different types of fields to the state and then render them. \r\nEvery updating of dom(adding new field) I have to check whether I should do something more by checking the hight of added elements, for example, add a break between elements. \r\nFields are represented by the tree structure of data, so I created the class which helps me with going through the tree of fields and I keep it in the class property.\r\n\r\nI know how many times I have to modify the DOM so It will be a fully controlled way of state update and it will finish after all fields are added to DOM but before I render all fields I am getting the error \"Maximum update depth exceeded\".\r\n\r\nDo you know How I can handle with such a problem? \r\nI found a solution by adding setTimeout on the way but I am not sure that is the clean solution?(commented code)\r\nIs it ok that I keep in component class property more complex class to manage structure of data?\r\n\r\nI am providing a simple example in codepage which shows the problem and throw the error.\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/93w2lp37xw\r\n",
