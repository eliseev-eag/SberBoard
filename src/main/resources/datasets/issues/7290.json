  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\n\nBug\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\n\nRendering a list of controlled checkboxes causes the reconciler to unnecessarily update (add or remove) the `checked` attribute on every render, regardless of whether the value has changed.\n\nI have a table with ~300-500 rows that needs to add a \"highlighted\" class to the rows based on some user interaction on another part of the screen. I'd expect that the table renderer would get called on every interaction, but I was seeing ~40ms render times in the Perf tool. I dug into it and it looks like every render the reconciler removes the \"checked\" attribute (see JSFiddle). The `checked` attribute on the row datum never changes; is always false.\n\nExtracting the rows into their own component and using `componentShouldUpdate` fixes the slowness, but this seems like a bug.\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\n\nHere are two JSFiddles demonstrating the issue: \n\nMinimal repro: https://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/49455/\n\nFull repro: https://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/49466/\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n\nThe reconciler shouldn't be touching the DOM for attributes that haven't changed.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\nMac OSX 10.11. Chrome 51, Safari 9.1, Firefox 44\n\nReact Version 15.0.1.\n",
