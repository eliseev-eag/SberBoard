Removing it, resolves the issue.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n1. `npx create-react-app test`\r\n2. Add \"proxy\": \"any website\" to package.json,\r\n3. `npm start`\r\n4. Make any change in index.js\r\n5. Browser didn't reload\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nLatest create-react-app version. Ubuntu 18.04\r\n",
