I have it imported and everything set up properly (I think?). please see below.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nI am trying to have an app context for the entire app. Here is the code where useContext is called:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport React, { useState, useContext } from 'react';\r\nimport { AppContext } from '../contexts/AppContext';\r\n\r\nconst Burger = (props) => {\r\n  const [clicked, setClicked] = useState(false);\r\n\r\n  const { toggleClicked } = useContext(AppContext);\r\n\r\n  return ( \r\n    <div id=\"burger\" data-state=\"burger\" onClick={toggleClicked()}>\r\n      <div class=\"bar1\"></div>\r\n      <div class=\"bar2\"></div>\r\n      <div class=\"bar3\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n \r\nexport default Burger;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nand here is the context file: \r\n```\r\nimport React, { useState, createContext } from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport const AppContext = createContext();\r\n\r\nconst AppContextProvider = (props) => {\r\n  const [burgerClicked, setBurgerClicked] = useState(false);\r\n\r\n  const toggleClicked = () => {\r\n    setBurgerClicked(true);\r\n    let overlay = document.getElementsByClassName('overlay');\r\n    if (overlay.dataset.state = 'on') {\r\n      overlay.dataset.state = 'off'\r\n    } else {\r\n      overlay.dataset.state = 'on';\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <AppContext.Provider value={{toggleClicked, burgerClicked}}>\r\n      {props.children}\r\n    </AppContext.Provider>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default AppContextProvider;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nuseContext is defined and allows me to access context variables.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThis is the latest version of React and Firefox. The version of React is 16.8.6. It is installed both globally and in the local directory. Any help is very much appreciated. The suggestions I've gotten so far are that I'm importing it wrong or I'm using the wrong version, which I'm fairly certain are both not true. This is happening in two different projects and I can't really get any work done until I can sort it :(",
