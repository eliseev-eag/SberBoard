  "body": "I ran into an issue recently when attempting to get particular child components, and I noticed something interesting...\n\nIt seems that the order in which this.props.children is populated is based on execution time of each component, and not the actual order in which they are positioned.\n\nLet me give you an example:\n\n``` html\n<MainComponent>\n    <h1>Hello <b>World</b></h1>\n\n    <p>Hello world!</p>\n</MainComponent>\n```\n\nThe current method I'm using to try and grab the `<h1>` element is by using `this.props.children.pop()`. The expectation (since `this.props.children` is an array) is that the first element in the array would be the `<h1>` tag. However, since there are other components inside of the `<h1>`, it is added to the array after the `<p>` regardless of the order in which it is declared.\n\nI understand that **React** provides ways of manipulating the children via `React.Children`, however, there's no real method of differentiating between certain children without it being cumbersome.\n\n**This:**\n\n``` javascript\nvar heading = this.props.children.pop();\n```\n\n**Turns into this:**\n\n``` javascript\nvar heading;\n\nReact.Children.map(this.props.children, function(child){\n    if(!heading && child.displayName === \"h1\") {\n        heading = child;\n    }\n\n    return child;\n});\n```\n\nMaybe providing some sort of interface to search/retrieve specific children using `React.Children` may be beneficial? Something like `React.Children.getByDisplayName('h1')` or similar?\n\nBecause `React.Children.map` requires a callback (and as such, is not entirely portable), this is a bit cumbersome to pull out and put into a mixin or utility object for my own reuse without having to copy/paste these 7 lines into every component that I would like to retrieve specific children for.\n\nI apologize if there are already resources within **React** to do this (or maybe a methodology to follow instead). In my searching, I was not able to find anything.\n",
