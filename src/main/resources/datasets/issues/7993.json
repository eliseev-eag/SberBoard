  "body": "This builds on top of #7941 + new tests I added in #7949 (hence the master merge commit).\nIt adds basic support for error boundaries during mount to Fiber.\n\nCommit for review: 833a7f89427ff27fb14dc31ebdbcf47c247ed5af.\n\nTest plan: `npm test -- ErrorB`.\n\n```\n â€º Ran all tests matching \"ErrorB\".\n â€º 13 tests failed, 14 tests passed (27 total in 1 test suite, run time 1.545s)\n```\n\nMost of those 13 failing tests are failing because of the lack of `componentWillUpdate` and `componentWillReceiveProps`.\n\nA few thoughts:\n- This my first \"real\" Fiber PR so I have no idea what I'm doing.\n- Adding a flag to all fibers seems bad. I'm not sure where to keep that state though. I need to store somewhere that we're \"retrying\" and if we fail, we should propagate error up. We used to rely on stack for this.\n- I added some code to handle `setState` in `componentWillMount`.\n- The part where I put the error flag and try to clear all work in progress is funny. Is there a better way?\n- Neat: errors in `setState()` are now caught and I didn't have to do anything special to make that works ðŸ˜„ .\n",
