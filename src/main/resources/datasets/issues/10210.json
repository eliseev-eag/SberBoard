  "body": "**Edit:** This is ready for review.\r\n\r\n**what is the change?:**\r\nWe want to warn when users render into a container which was manually\r\nemptied or updated outside of React. This can lead to the cryptic error\r\nabout not being able to remove a node, or just lead to silent failures\r\nof render. This warning should make things more clear.\r\n\r\nNote that this covers the case where the contents of the root container\r\nare manually updated, but does not cover the case where something was\r\nmanually updated deeper in the tree.\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nTo maintain parity and increase clarity before releasing v16.0 beta.\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\n`yarn test`\r\n\r\n**issue:**\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8854\r\n\r\nlast item under the '16 beta' checklist.",
