I don't know why yet, but removing the Just Noticeable Difference heuristic was sufficient to fix/hide the bugs again. In the interest of fixing this downstream quickly, let's revert it and land it again once we've figured out the root cause.\r\n\r\nSpecially, what I've done is this PR is revert `computeMsUntilTimeout` to what is what in the last known non-buggy commit: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/3e2e930d62ac7166695e0c5b1538ebb7a41cd3da/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberScheduler.new.js#L1818-L1833",
