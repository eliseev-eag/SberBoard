  "body": "I just spend the whole day debugging a race condition where one dispatch sometimes called a reducer twice and because of my reducer wasn't pure, the app behaved incorrectly.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst reducer: Reducer<State, Action> = (state, action) => {\r\n  const getSortedFocusables = () => {\r\n    // Never do that! Reducer isn't pure!\r\n    return [...state.focusables].sort(documentPositionComparator);\r\n  };\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs Sebastian told me: \r\n\r\n> One dispatch can call a reducer twice under certain conditions but it would call it with the old state as input. So if it's pure, it's unobservable. A reducer function must be pure.\r\n\r\nA reducer function must be pure.\r\nA reducer function must be pure.\r\nA reducer function must be pure.\r\nA reducer function must be pure.\r\n\r\nI hope it's possible eslint-plugin-react-hooks could detect it, but I am not sure whether it's possible.",
