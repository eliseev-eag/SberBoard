  "body": "I would like to suggest to deprecate jsx format.\n- pro:\n  - easy to match closing tag with eyes\n- fake pro: \n  - Designer friendly?\n    No really, designer still have to know everything about javascript to write web page, and even more, they need to know all javascript tools to build.\n- cons:\n  - It encourage ugly deeply embedded code\n  - It create a whole dimension in the ecosystem of javascript. Every editor need to have a syntax highlighter, formatter, linter for it. Every language that compiles to javascript might need to support jsx.  DefinetelyTyped have better support for tsx than ts. ( ReactDOM.div don't check properties in ts)\n",
