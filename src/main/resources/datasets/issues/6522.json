  "body": "When you put an object into a component that has been decorated, say by a HOC called \"StyledComponent\", you get an error like this:\n\n```\nUncaught Invariant Violation: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {title, uid}). If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead or wrap the object using createFragment(object) from the React add-ons. Check the render method of `StyledComponent`.\n```\n\nProblem is, many components are decorated like this. So in effect this error does nothing to help me figure out where the error came from.\n\nI would like to see a few things. First step I think would be to show the full path:\n\n```\nCheck the render method of Main > SubComponent > StyledComponent > ...\n```\n\nSecond would be to have integration with the React devtools so you could actually click and see the highlighted path/component.\n\nFinal would be, if possible, to show the tagname that contained the object as well.\n\nJust brainstorming for a better React!\n",
