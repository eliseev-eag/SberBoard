  "body": "We haven't been good at maintaining [ReactTransitionGroup](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html) as we don't use it much at Facebook.\n\nAs a result it's stagnating: the bugs don't get fixed, new features don't get added, APIs don't acknowledge changes in React (e.g. fake lifecycle hooks that can't work on functional components), nobody has the time to review PRs to it, and it's like a dead weight on the core team. We all feel guilty about it but there's not much we can do.\n\nThere are some great alternatives in the ecosystem such as [React Motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion). However we understand there are a lot of people who are happy with `TransitionGroup` as it is.\n\nThis issue is a call for a new maintainer. If you are using `TransitionGroup` widely in your codebase and would be happy maintaining a fork of it and documentation, please let us know here, and we'll deprecate our package in favor of your package.\n",
