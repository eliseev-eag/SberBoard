  "body": "<!--\r\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\r\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nFeature\r\n\r\nA couple of things have surprised me about the new asynchronous `act` API.\r\n\r\n#### 1. Act doesn't return a promise.\r\n\r\nCurrently the `act` function returns an object with a `then` method that doesn't return a promise.\r\n\r\nRecently, I tried to write something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nact(() => {\r\n  return doSomethingAsynchronous()\r\n})\r\n.then(() => {\r\n  // ...\r\n})\r\n.then(() => {\r\n  // ...\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second `.then` call throws an error because the value that is returned from `act` isn't a full-fledged `Promise`, but rather just an object that contains a `.then` method that returns `undefined`. This is fine for simple `async`/`await` cases, but definitely caught me by surprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 2. Act discards the returned value.\r\n\r\nAct also throws away the value returned from the async function callback, which makes it harder to use the values generated there. For example, if I wanted to use the value yielded by `doSomethingAsynchronous`, I would need to introduce a mutable variable:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet returnedValue;\r\nawait act(async () => {\r\n  returnedValue = await doSomethingAsynchronous()\r\n})\r\n\r\n// use returnedValue here\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf `act` simply propogates the returned value from the asynnchronous callback, this will solve the confusing bits above, allowing for things like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst returnedValue = await act(() => doSomethingAsynchronous())\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
