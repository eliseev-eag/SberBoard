  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIf direct child node of fragment was replaced by other node not created by react — react will throw `Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node': The node to be removed is not a child of this node.` when Fragment will be unmounted\r\n\r\n**Smallest reproduction case:**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-replace-element-fragment-error-0rkqw\r\nSecond and fourth buttons will produce error on second click.\r\nWhat’s strange that if you’ll delete the content in fragment in content editable div (button 5) — it will not throw error.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nReact not throwing error. Maybe warning?\r\nWhy? because any browser extension in any browser can replace any node and this will lead to broken application.\r\nOtherwise documentation should be improved and state clearly that fragment is unsafe to use if there is a chance of third party DOM modification. (I understand why it is happening in the first place, but not agree that it should).\r\nAlso it would be great to include DOM path into original error if possible, because for example we create captured this error using sentry and it is unclear where it is happening and it’s quite hard to improve the situation.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16.8.3, no, I think it was broken all along",
