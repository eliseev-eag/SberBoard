  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThe path to upgrading from React 15 to 16 should be simple. From the docs:\r\n> With minor exceptions, if your app runs in 15.6 without any warnings, it should work in 16.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 cases that I found where this isn't true:\r\n- `this.state` can no longer be declared in `componentWillMount`. It never _should_ be declared there anyways, but React15 never yelled at me & I found an old component that did this & it was completely broken.\r\n- The callback for `this.setState` can no longer be falsy. Before, i would write `const cb = false && callback`. now i have to write `const cb = false ? callback : undefined`. Again, it's sloppy code that should have never existed anyways, but it worked in React 15.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nAdding these 2 things to the migration guide. Maybe re-enabling support for the falsy `setState` callback.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16, all browsers, It all worked in React 15\r\n",
