  "body": "1. Fixes `getComponentName()` for a few cases where it was incorrectly reading the type (https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/a482fb41c35448cc1f2cc2e1e7b655a11e8f8957). We didn't notice because we rarely call it for anything other than user-defined components.\r\n2. Changes its signature to require just the `type` alone rather than the Fiber. This might seem like it makes the calling code longer. However we often *already* have the type destructured anyway when we call it. I also remember from writing some of that code that it was awkward to always *have to* pass a Fiber around when I only needed a type.\r\n3. This lets us remove two ad-hoc forks of `getComponentName()` that don't handle all the cases it does.",
