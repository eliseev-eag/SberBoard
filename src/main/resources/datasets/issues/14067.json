  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nI can't see `Bottom-Up` or `Call Tree` information for the specific components listed in `User Timing` when I profile my React app following the directions described at https://calibreapp.com/blog/2017-11-28-debugging-react/ (this tutorial was recommended by the react docs).\r\n\r\nOthers have recently reported the same issue on StackOverflow:\r\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52364829/no-timing-breakdown-in-user-timing-section-in-performance-tab-in-chrome-dev-tool\r\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52315796/stats-for-child-components-are-not-always-available-in-user-timing-section-of-ch\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nI can reproduce this using a simple repo I found on the internet:\r\n1. Clone https://github.com/larkintuckerllc/react-patterns (The repo contains several examples. The **User Timings `Bottom-Up` and `Call Tree` information do not show up on the `lifecycle` app**. Interestingly, the **User Timings showed up correctly on the `jsx` example app**).\r\n2. After navigating to the lifecycle app folder, run `npm install`.\r\n3. `npm start`\r\n4. Add `?react_perf` to the URL.\r\n5. Open Chrome Performance tools. Press the \"Start Profiling and Reload page\" \r\n6. Open the User Timing section\r\n7. Select a specific component. The `Summary` tab shows up as expected. There's nothing in the `Bottom-Up` or `Call Tree` tabs.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe `Bottom-Up` and `Call Tree` tabs show sub call information as described in the tutorial.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n```\r\nReact: ^15.5.4 (For example issue I posted) 15.6.2 (For the production app I was having issues with)\r\nChrome: 70.0.3538.77 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\nJavaScript | V8 7.0.276.32\r\nOS: MacOs High Sierra, Version 10.13.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this was a problem in previous versions major version React or not. [One of the StackOverflow questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52364829/no-timing-breakdown-in-user-timing-section-in-performance-tab-in-chrome-dev-tool) mentioned that they were on React 16 so it sounds like it could be a problem there too.",
