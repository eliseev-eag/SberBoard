  "body": "After much discussion with @necolas and quite a bit of internal testing, we came up with an idea to improve the experimental event API and its propagation system. Rather than return a `boolean` from the event responder `onHandle` to indicate if an event should be propagated, all events are now propagated depending on the responder and the event component.\r\n\r\nResponders now have the `stopLocalPropagation` option (required). This tells the event system what it should do we encountering this particular event responder. If this flag is set to `true`, then when we encounter the same event responder during propagation, we skip calling the event listeners on that responder for that event component.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there was some confusion over the phases on the event object, and so now `onHandle` has been split into three methods: `onEvent`, `onEventCapture` and `onRootEvent`.\r\n\r\nRef #15257",
