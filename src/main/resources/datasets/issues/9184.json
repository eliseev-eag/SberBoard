  "body": "I tried to rebase #7936 with latest master and everything was thoroughly screwed up. So rather than trying to merge master, I just made a new clean branch off master and cherry-picked the commits over. I’m not closing the original PR at this point, however, because there seem to be many interested people following the activity over there, and I don’t want to prevent them from doing so. I’ll make new built versions of everything off of these commits applied to 15-stable and update the npm / yarn instructions on using those when I get a chance.\r\n\r\nI’ve also made a commit with a couple guards to accommodate varying cross-browser behaviors. The guards are for https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7936#issuecomment-270568409 and https://github.com/summernote/summernote/issues/1057",
