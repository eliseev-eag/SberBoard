The property is set if the user requests to use the shadow DOM and the browser they are using supports it. Polymer uses [a similar check](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/blob/edb59eb6283074ce54f374b30b884c9f9fcf9f5f/test/unit/polymer-dom-content.html#L308) in their test suite for shady dom.\n\ncc: @gaearon \n",
