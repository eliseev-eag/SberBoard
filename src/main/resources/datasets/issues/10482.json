  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\ncomponentWillReceiveProps is being called twice in a row without a render (or a call to shouldComponentUpdate) between them.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, `this.props` has the same value in both calls, but the object passed as `nextProps` is different.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I have code like this:\r\n```javascript\r\ncomponentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {\r\n  if (\r\n    nextProps.organization.id != null &&\r\n    this.props.organization.id !== nextProps.organization.id\r\n  ) {\r\n    // Dispatch a redux action that performs an xhr request using nextProps.organization.id\r\n    // to load some_resource\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI noticed that my redux action (and the xhr request) was being performed twice. In both calls, `this.props.organization.id` was `undefined`. But also in both calls, `nextProps.organization.id` was defined.\r\n\r\nIn the second call, I was also being passed the results of the first xhr call, which was stored in my redux store and passed down into this component via react-redux/connect\r\n\r\nI also confirmed that `shouldComponentUpdate`, `componentWillUpdate`, and `render` were all only called after the second time through.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 15.6.1\r\nGoogle Chrome 60.0.3112.90\r\nWindows 10",
