Possibly either, possibly neither.  I think I'm OK with the current behavior, if it's intended.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nReactDOM throws an error when rendering a `<br />` that contains an empty fragment as a child.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/7f3dbpxq/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThis might be expected.  I had some code that created fragments that instead would return `null` when the fragment was empty, to work around https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12964.  When that was fixed, I removed the special case and returned empty fragments instead, which worked for me in many cases, but not this one.  I think my code should better distinguish between void and regular elements, so I'm not requesting any change in React.  Just posting this in case it's not desired.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16.4.1.  Seems to happen in 16.0.0 as well using arrays instead of fragments: https://jsfiddle.net/6vL8ws47/",
