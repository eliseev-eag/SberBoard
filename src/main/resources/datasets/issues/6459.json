  "body": "I'm sort of hesitant to send out a pull request for this, but a conversation with a co-worker about why React doesn't allow custom attributes (specifically for attribute-based style rules) triggered my curiosity.\n\nThis pull request configures `DOMPropertyOperations` to allow all attributes to pass through. It maintains the whitelist for attributes that need special behavior.\n\nThe side-effect of removing properties from the whitelist is that the dev tools no longer warn on casing issues. To get around this, I added some code to the UnknownProperty dev tool for such occurrences.\n",
