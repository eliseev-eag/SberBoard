  "body": "I'm rendering my React app at the document root, with server-side rendering.\nI've got an email and password login form. It renders on the server without any state (both fields empty).\nWhen the browser loads the page, the email and password are autofilled by the browser.\n\nThis happens before React bootstraps, and when it loads, it wipes out that state. So the user sees the inputs being autofilled then being emptied. Not ideal.\n\nI tried using `componentWillMount` to grab the raw DOM node value and `setState` before render, but react complains that the checksum is invalid.\n\nI realise this is a case where the DOM is being modified before react bootstraps on the client, but it would be good to be able to do this kinda stuff...\n\n**Update:** A workaround I used was to pull the values out of the `<input>`s inside `componentWillMount`, then `setState` to those values inside `componentDidMount`. Would still be nice to handle this cleanly though...\n",
