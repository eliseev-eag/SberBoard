  "body": "Hello. I love React and all about it. But sometimes it is so difficult to search ready-for-use components which was built by React. Or I want to share with community my new super-cool component. Is it possible to make a package manager for components? And it will be cool:\n`reactpm publish MaskedInput`\nor\n`reactpm install KhanComponents`\n\njQuery has tonns of plugins but they haven't place for searching, installing and etc. So people try again reinventing wheel which already exists and do his job better.\n",
