  "body": "I like that the test renderer's `unstable_flushThrough` method requires you to provide the expected yields so that it can verify them. I think the `unstable_flushAll` method should do this too, so it doesn't rely on us remembering to `expect(...).toEqual(...)` outside.\r\n\r\nThis is also a backwards-breaking change, but since both methods are \"unstable_\" that might not matter? (The change to `unstable_flushThrough` didn't seem to draw any attention when it was made.)\r\n\r\nThoughts?",
