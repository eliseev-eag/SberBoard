  "body": "I'd like to contribute to make React docs mobile friendly, because I cry every time I need to look up something on a phone ðŸ˜¢.\n\nThere had been and attempt to do that some time ago here: #5404 with this PR: #5512, but apparently it was abandoned by an author.\n\nI'd like to wait with sending my PR until you accept the navigation design (the reset is pretty straight-forward I guess).\n\nSo, this is pretty much how I would see this (removed downloads tab, because we're on phone, but there's a place for that just in case):\n\n![docs](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5106466/18968064/d58a07a2-8687-11e6-8086-f3c1ee812b80.jpg)\n\nAnd a little gif:\n\n![docs](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5106466/18968004/94ec5984-8687-11e6-8620-44f10ac0d9c1.gif)\n\nIt's almost identical as on React Native docs, so we would have kind of consistency here. \nBut I'd rather like to avoid sticky header, as it takes too much space.\n\ncc @lacker as @gaearon advised me to contact you on this one.\n",
