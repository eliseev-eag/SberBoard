  "body": "I've read the previous discussions regarding the React (and other Facebook OSS) license, in particular #10191, and I agree with most of the clarificatory remarks (esp. by @gaearon & @sebmarkbage) that Facebook doesn't intend to use this license offensively.\r\n\r\nHowever, after today's [announcement](https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/) by Automattic that WordPress.com's Calypso and WordPress Core's Gutenberg will no longer be using React, I believe that Facebook's efforts in clarifying the React license have clearly fallen short. At the least, the FAQs need to be extended and explained in much greater detail. Ideally, this recent announcement should cause Facebook to rework the license altogether.\r\n\r\nSome have said that the issue tracker is not the place for this discussion. I believe that this is untrue (though I apologize for causing noise). The growing apprehension to use React will undoubtedly have effects down the line regarding the React ecosystem. Buy in from the WordPress core community would have been a _huge_ benefit to React (I think? maybe I'm wrong about that). Further, this issue track is where this license issue will have the greatest exposure.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, as the Automattic post implies, the problem is not the license itself, but the perception of the license. That problem is an issue for React, and the issue will only get worse without being addressed more genuinely. I know that the developers here can't do that, but I hope that something can be done, or that these concerns can be funneled through the proper channels.",
