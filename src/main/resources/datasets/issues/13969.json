  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nQuite possibly a bug (or maybe confusion about the current API)\r\n\r\nI am using the new Context API as well as the new `static contextType` in React 16.6. I am passing context down a couple components deep but when I attempt to access the context within the component, the object is empty (~only the default value passed into `createContext` is being displayed~). This is happening in a current feature I am working on at my job, so I cannot display that code, but I did create a Codesandbox with the gist of the problem.\r\n\r\nHere is a demonstration of the behavior: https://codesandbox.io/s/r4myz959ro\r\n\r\nI would expect to be able to access the current values of the context. This way, if those values change, I would always have the most recent values. Now, maybe this is expected behavior, however, it would be confusing if it is.\r\n\r\nReact 16.6\r\nReactDOM 16.6\r\n",
