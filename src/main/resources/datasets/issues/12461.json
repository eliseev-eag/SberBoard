However, this has changed in React 16. Now the new component has `componentWillMount` called before the old component has had its `componentWillUnmount` called.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would have expected that the React 15 behaviour would have been maintained. It seems strange to me that new components are starting to be mounted before an old component has unmounted.\r\n\r\n[React 15 example](https://codesandbox.io/s/207on0p0ly)\r\n[React 16 example](https://codesandbox.io/s/nw6y7j0n9m)\r\n",
