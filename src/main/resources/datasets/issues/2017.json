  "body": "The `dialog` tag is available in Chrome 37 (and in Chrome 36 behind a flag). I'm trying to use it, and was initially confused when it wasn't being added to the DOM.\n\nAdding it to [ReactDOM.js](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/browser/ReactDOM.js) seems to be enough for it to work (but I'm not really familiar with React's code). So I'm hoping that support will be added for it soon.\n\n(http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html#the-dialog-element documents the element, there is more info and demos at http://demo.agektmr.com/dialog/.)\n",
