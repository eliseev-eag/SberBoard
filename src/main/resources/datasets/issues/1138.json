  "body": "What do you think of a \"mixed in\" callback for mixins which is called at the moment of applying a mixin to a component with component's spec as an argument?\n\n```\nvar SomeTrickeryMixin = {\n  mixin: function(spec) {\n    // redefine .render() or do some other dangerous things\n  },\n\n  ...\n};\n```\n\nBesides overriding `.render()` such callbacks can be used when you want to implement a \"custom policy\" for some methods (wrap method, call-before, call-after, ...).\n\nAs a downside that would make things a little less straightforward from a (mixin) user perspective.\n",
