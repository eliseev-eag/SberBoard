  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nReport a bug / confusion point\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\nImplementing `shallowCompare` inside `shouldComponentUpdate` will always return true if you do not pass `nextState` param.\n\n``` js\n// In a component without state you would not want to pass nextState\nshouldComponentUpdate(nextProps) {\n  return shallowCompare(this, nextProps) // => always true if you don't pass nextState\n}\n```\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nI would expect the `shallowCompare` method to handle cases where `nextState` is not passed in OR for the documentation to be more clear, stating that you MUST pass `nextState`.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\nI am using React 15.2.0. This is not specific to any browser or OS.\n",
