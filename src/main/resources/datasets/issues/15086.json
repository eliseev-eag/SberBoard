  "body": "When enabling `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` I noticed a strange issue that took me quite some time to figure out. A ref was used inside an effect hook but the linting rule still wanted me to declare it as a dependency. I remembered that I saw code that could detect wether `React.useRef()` is used and it took me a few minutes until I realized that the component in question was using `React.createRef()` instead.\r\n\r\nI remember that I did a similar mistake in the beginning when I first played with hooks as the concept was not clear to me yet so I figured a warning would be helpful for others.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is not so nice unfortunately since we can't just assert for a missing dispatcher because the dispatcher is set to the context-only-dispatcher when class constructors are run (which is when we want `React.createRef()` to be used). I added a DEV only extension to the dispatcher but I'm open for other ideas. Maybe we need to split the `CurrentDispatcher` into the `CurrentHookDispatcher` and the `CurrentContextDispatcher` so we handle that differently?",
