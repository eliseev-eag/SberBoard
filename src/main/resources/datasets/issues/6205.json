If I use `bind` on event handlers or the `() => { }` pattern, there could be performance issues with re-rendering. If I use the method described in the article above, then I can't pass arguments to a single DRY function, I have to create several functions to handle different scenarios (as in one of the answers in the SO post, with `setEmail`, `setPassword`).\n\nWhat's the solution here?\n",
