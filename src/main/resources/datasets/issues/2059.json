  "body": "I've started using immutablejs together with reactjs.\n\nHowever, I've noticed that passing around immutable objects doesn't quite fit together with reactjs, i.e. {...myObject}, {myObjects.map(object => React.DOM.div()} and propTypes don't quite support them without first converting to JS object which has an unnecessary overhead.\n\nAny thoughts or advice on this issue?\n",
