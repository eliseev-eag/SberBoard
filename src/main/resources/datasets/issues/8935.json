  "body": "The current live docs at https://chenglou.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html contain the following incorrect example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// tutorial16.js\r\nthis.refs.author.getDOMNode().value.trim();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html, \r\n\r\n> The other big change weâ€™re making in this release is exposing refs to DOM components as the DOM node itself. That means: we looked at what you can do with a ref to a React DOM component and realized that the only useful thing you can do with it is call this.refs.giraffe.getDOMNode() to get the underlying DOM node. Starting with this release, this.refs.giraffe is the actual DOM node.\r\n\r\nso, perhaps the example should be changed to\r\n\r\n```\r\n// tutorial16.js\r\nthis.refs.author.value.trim();\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried to click on the \"Edit on GitHub\" link at the top of the tutorial, but got a 404. So, the only thing I could think to do was to open an issue. Hope it helps.\r\n\r\nThanks. :heart:",
