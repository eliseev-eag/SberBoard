  "body": "Since testing is horrible without refs IMHO, I made this.\r\n\r\nI chose to have elements instead of instances to avoid rendering recursively all nodes and to allow the same way to access it. I think navigating in shallow instances, if necessary (since it's shallow rendering...), could easily fit in testing library like `enzyme`.\r\n\r\nI actually started trying to solve the need of refs in shallow rendering in `enzyme` (since it's a smaller learning curve for contributing than with `react`) but I couldn't find a way to include callback refs in the solution. With this, it'll be pretty simple :)\r\n\r\nSo here's what this PR allow:\r\n\r\nFor string refs:\r\n```javascript\r\nrenderer.getMountedInstance().refs.myButton\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor callback refs:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst instance = renderer.getMountedInstance();\r\nconst myButton = instance.myButton\r\n```",
