  "body": "- Internet Explorer has never needed these prefixes (see https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-animation and https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-transitions)\r\n- Opera 11.5 was the only release that needed a prefix (for CSS Transitions). Support for that version has already been removed in #11921\r\n\r\nI think the `Moz` prefix could be dropped as well. It's only needed by Firefox 15 and older. This could open up a small refactor avoiding building these maps. WDYT?",
