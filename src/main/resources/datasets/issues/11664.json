  "body": "Hej!\r\n\r\nThis is a super interesting test to look at since the tests cover 3 different areas when you try to rewrite them using only public APIs. So far I have converted 1/3 of the tests to use public APIs only. The rest I'd like to discuss.\r\n\r\n### `traverseTwoPhase`\r\nThese were fairly straightforward to rewrite. I could even used the same `expectedCalls` arrays for the expectations on the mock.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that could be a bit nicer is the calls to `eventHandler`. I would like to factor out passing the arguments but #11663 prevents me from passing the event phase dynamically.\r\n\r\n### `traverseEnterLeave`\r\nIn order to test them in the same fashion as most other _public API_ tests I would have to dispatch `onmouseenter` and `onmouseleave` events against the DOM nodes and see which event handlers React calls. Unfortunately dispatching these event types doesn't have an effect and looking at `EnterLeaveEventPlugin.js` it seems like _enter_ and _leave_ events are implemented using `onmouseover` and `onmouseout`. \r\nThe tests seem to verify the _capturing_ and _bubbling_ behaviour which are inherently different between `onmouseenter` and `onmouseover` as well as `onmouseleave` and `onmouseout`. I would be really thank for some ideas on how we could solve this.\r\n\r\n### `getFirstCommonAncestor` aka `getLowestCommonAncestor`\r\nThis function is only used by the `ResponderEventPlugin` which is in turn only used by React Native. This doesn't mean we can't test it only with public APIs but we might struggle with that in our _JSDOM_ environment. Again would be great to discuss alternatives :)  ",
