  "body": "Right now ReactCSSTransitionGroup forces ending one transition to start the next one. This is not the behaviour everyone wants, so I added a `transitionQueue` property which is `true` by default, and if set to `false` will disable transitions queues, so will force ending the current transition and inmediatelly start the next one.\n\nI added this because I wanted `transitionLeave` to start as soon an element is removed, instead of waiting for `transitionEnter` to finish.\n",
