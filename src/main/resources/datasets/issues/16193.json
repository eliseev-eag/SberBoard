  "body": "I report this issue here since I didn't find any occurence of it anywhere else.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nRight now whenever I want to read an env variable in the process.env object whose value contains a dollar sign '$'. The value is modified once passed to react and replaced by the corresponding env variable.\r\n\r\nFor example: If I type the following in my terminal : \r\n`export REACT_APP_EXAMPLE=\"my\\$value\"`\r\nIf I check again in the terminal I have : \r\n```\r\necho $REACT_APP_EXAMPLE \r\nmy$value\r\n```\r\nBut once my app is launched, React replace the portion followed by the '$' by the content of the 'value' environment variable (empty by default). So if for example I want to log it, I will have : \r\n```\r\nconsole.log(process.env.REACT_APP_EXAMPLE);\r\n-> my\r\n```\r\nAnd if my 'value' variable is set :\r\n`export value=something`\r\n```\r\nconsole.log(process.env.REACT_APP_EXAMPLE);\r\n-> mysomething\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nReact should give the proper value and not overriding its content because of special characters. Especially since I used double quotes and backslash expression to avoid the confusion when setting the variables.\r\nThis seems to be an issue with React when it redefines and filters the process.env object since I don't have this issue with plain JS or when running a node console.\r\nFor now I use dotenv to avoid that behaviour but it is still an issue worthy of note.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?**\r\nReact v.16.8.6\r\nOS: Ubuntu 16.04",
