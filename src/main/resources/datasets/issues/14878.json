  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nSimple memo components receive new props during context change if their parent got rerendered.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/jp21pwzrv9\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nConceptually from the user's perspective `React.memo(Component)` & `React.memo(Component, shallowEqual)` should behave exactly the same (but they dont)\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nCurrent React's master ( 0e67969cb1ad8c27a72294662e68fa5d7c2c9783 ) & current latest release 16.8.2\r\n\r\nI've already written a failing test for this - https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/14876 . Would love to work on fixing this but as mentioned in this PR, I would require some guidance on how this should get fixed properly.\r\n",
