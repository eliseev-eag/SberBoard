  "body": "So I was going over the Inheritance vs Composition discussion all over the place. I will talk about my use case.\r\n\r\nI am creating a hierarchy of components using react. Stuff like button -> buttonBar for example. So for these sort of things, whatever functionalities I have defined in the button component needs to be present as is in the buttonBar components.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nclass Button extends React.Component {\r\n\tshouldComponentUpdate()  {\r\n\t\t//do some prevalidation\r\n\t\treturn result;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tmyButtonfn = () => {\r\n\t\t//do Something here\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tmyButtonfn2 = () => {\r\n\t\t//doSomething else\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass ButtonBar extends Button {\r\n\tshouldComponentUpdate() {\r\n\t\treturn myLogic && super.shouldComponentUpdate.call(this);\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\tmyButtonBarfn = () => {\r\n\t\t//I should be able to do this\r\n\t\tthis.myButtonfn();\r\n\t\tthis.myButtonfn2();\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently I have implemented inheritance to achieve this. What is the correct way of going about this? I don't want to go back to es5 way of using with this. React.createClass.",
