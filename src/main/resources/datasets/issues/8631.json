Options include:\r\n\r\n1. **Drop support for it**: If we do this we should update the `ReactContextValidator-test` test to assert that the `prevContext` parameter is not passed and update to Stack to mirror this behavior.\r\n2. **Support it (option A)**: Store it as an expando property on instance (eg `__reactInternalPrevContext`). Adding to the instance avoids bloating Fibers for all of the types that don't need this property _and_ keeps our Fiber-consuming functions monomorphic.\r\n2. **Support it (option B)**: Use `stateNode` to store a wrapper object around instance and previous context for the case of `ClassComponent`s. This prevents all non-`ClassComponent` fibers from growing while also keeping fiber-consuming methods monomorphic. Since this only impacts `ClassComponent` it should hopefully introduce minimal forking.\r\n\r\nRegarding continued support: At this time it does not seem like this parameter is being used by React components within Facebook but a quick [Github search](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=componentDidUpdate+prevContext&type=Code&ref=searchresults) seems to suggest the parameter is being used externally (eg [1](https://github.com/bogus34/react-form-components/blob/63597b6ef9e0e1d817a4562be6c5f0dad542caf8/src/select_component.coffee#L19), [2](https://github.com/PBRT/PBRT/blob/671a19fdea48216b5d0cc650c3364a76590bd919/client/components/heroshot/heroshot.jsx#L13), [3](https://github.com/roparat/PicasaGalleryReact/blob/cc5a37c089c5c59d4cf26d0b6828f5fff952bfd5/src/AllGallery.js#L44), etc.).",
