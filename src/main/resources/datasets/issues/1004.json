  "body": "I'm trying to JSON.stringify an object that was previously used by React.\n\nHowever, React adds an `__owner__` property to the object on mount that has a circular structure, and can't be stringified.\n\nI no longer want the component rendered, it there any way to release the object and remove the `__owner__` that's less hacky than `delete object.__owner__`?\n\nWill the property go away if I somehow unmount the react component?\n",
