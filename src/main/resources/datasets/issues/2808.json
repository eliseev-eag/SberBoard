  "body": "Builds on top of #2806\n\nThis allows state to be set up in the constructor instead of through\ngetInitialState. getInitialState is now considered part of \"classic\".\nTherefore, they move into ReactClass's constructor.\n\nAs a consequence of this, we no longer have a mapping between the internal\nrepresentation and the public instance during the mounting process.\nBecause the constructor hasn't returned yet.\n\nWe used to have a special case for calling setState in getInitialState\nwhich was just ignored. This makes that throw and the component is\nconsidered unmounted during the construction phase.\n",
