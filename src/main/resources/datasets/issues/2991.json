  "body": "This diff enables setState to accept a function in addition to a state partial. If you provide a function, it will be called with the up-to-date `state, props, context` as arguments.\n\nThis enables some nicer syntax for complex setState patterns:\n\nIf setState is doing an increment and wants to guarantee atomicy, you need a function:\n\n```\nthis.setState(state => ({ number: state.number + 1 }));\n```\n\nThis atomicy is particularly important if setState is called multiple times in a single frame of execution as the result of complex user actions. It's a tricky bug to chase down and difficult to determine how to fix when you find it. The current pattern of reaching into _pendingState relies on an implementation detail.\n\nIn this example: props.doAction() may result in your ancestor re-rendering and providing you with new props or context. If setState is called directly with an object literal referencing `this.props` or `this.context`, it will use the _old_ version of those values, not the new value. Using a function solves for this case:\n\n```\nthis.props.doAction();\nthis.setState((state, props) => ({ number: state.number * props.multiplier }));\n```\n",
