  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is intentional design or if its a bug. Someone in Reactiflux asked about this so i was curios\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nReducer passed to `useReducer` cant take initial state. Instead, you need to pass second arg\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nReducers must be created like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst initialState = {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhy cant we do:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst initialState = {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction reducer(state = initialState, action) {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is how Redux does it.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nv16.8.0-alpha.1",
