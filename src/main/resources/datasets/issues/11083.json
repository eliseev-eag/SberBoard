  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nMore of a DX issue, I think. Certainly a frustration in my upgrade. I would not have submitted, but @gaearon [told me thrice](https://twitter.com/erikras/status/915491449994608643) to do so.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nMy build _works_, [but is strewn with warnings](https://travis-ci.org/erikras/redux-form/jobs/283113416) that I would like to fix. Warnings like:\r\n```\r\nWarning: Received `false` for non-boolean attribute `dirty`. If this is expected, cast the value to a string.\r\n  in div\r\n  in Unknown (created by Form(Component))\r\n  in Form(Component) (created by Connect(Form(Component)))\r\n  in Connect(Form(Component)) (created by ReduxForm)\r\n  in ReduxForm\r\n  in Provider\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy library provides a HOC that provides boolean props. [At first](https://twitter.com/erikras/status/915491449994608643), I was concerned that React 16 would no longer allow this, but I think the problem is that one of my tests is carelessly leaking my props all the way into a `<div/>`. I even created [the dumbest HOC ever](https://codesandbox.io/s/v8l0pn3pxy) to test if a HOC could pass a boolean prop, and it seems like it can.\r\n\r\nHowever, from that \"stacktrace\" (component-trace?), it is not even remotely clear which of my 1630 tests is causing the warning. In previous versions, it would show me the exact stacktrace, with file names and line numbers, that generated the error.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.0.0, yes worked with previous.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I have several tests that _need_ to throw errors to alert library users that they are doing something wrong, but my test logs are now full of bright red:\r\n```\r\nConsider adding an error boundary to your tree to customize error handling behavior.\r\nYou can learn more about error boundaries at https://fb.me/react-error-boundaries.\r\n```\r\nIs that just a new fact of life for library developers, or can I `catch` those in my test somehow?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAll this can be replicated with the current [`master` branch of `redux-form`](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form).",
