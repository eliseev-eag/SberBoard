  "body": "Hey there, I've been struggling with an animation issue for almost an hour now:\n\n``` css\n.pop-enter {\n  transform: translateX(-33%)\n  transition: transform .5s ease-in;\n}\n\n.pop-enter.pop-enter-active {\n  transform: translateX(0%)\n}\n```\n\nI'm not expert in CSS animations so I simply copied it from the docs:\n\nhttps://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html\n\nIt turns out, that the solution was this:\n\n``` css\n.pop-enter {\n  transform: translateX(-33%)\n}\n\n.pop-enter.pop-enter-active {\n  transform: translateX(0%)\n  transition: transform .5s ease-in;\n}\n```\n\nWhen the element is rendered, it isnt initially set to `transform: translateX(-33%)`. Thus, it tried to animate it. Then the `-active` tag hits and its going back to the same place. Thus it appears as if no animation occurred at all.\n\nYou will save someone like a lot of pain and frustration if you fixed this example in the docs :+1: \n",
