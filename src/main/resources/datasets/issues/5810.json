  "body": "It's really ad hoc right now so we should make it better. It's not a huge deal since we do a shitty job of exposing the translations but there are groups of people actively contributing so we should do our best to make it easier.\n\n@thejameskyle has had great success using CrowdIn so I set up a project there - https://crowdin.com/project/react. I'll do some more work over the next few days to get it syncing from GH based on his article (https://github.com/thejameskyle/crowdin-sync) and then we'll go from there.\n\nThanks for the inspiration James!\n",
