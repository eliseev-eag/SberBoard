  "body": "We're seeing a mysterious behaviour with regards to generated keys. But **only** in production mode.\r\n\r\nNote the keys of the \"RelayAdHocQuery\" and \"TabPanel\" components at the bottom:\r\n\r\n![react-keys-production](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15837712/20484281/bd65c5ce-aff6-11e6-99a3-bd30c3424a0b.gif)\r\n\r\nAlso note that the parent hierarchy doesn't change. On each forced update of a parent, the keys in question simply append \".$\", so we're loosing state. Everything works as expected in development mode, where the component instances are reused based on the re-use of keys.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, despite our best efforts, we've been unable to isolate exactly why this happens, ie. as a simply reproducible test case. Maybe someone with knowledge of the key generating algorithms can points us towards a solution.\r\n\r\nReact 15.3.2. Seeing this in all evergreen browsers.",
