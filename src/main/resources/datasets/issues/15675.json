Would it be possible to create a new handler that you can pass in your host config that would tap into unmount commits?\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ncommitUnmount(node, internalInstanceHandler) {\r\n  // can be a noop by default\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could be added [where the hook handler is already being called](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberCommitWork.js#L739).\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you would consider this. :smile_cat: ",
