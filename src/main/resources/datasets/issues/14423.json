  "body": "The \"react-is\" package appears to lack checks for `React.Suspense` & `React.lazy()`. Since libraries like enzyme depend on this to implement proper support for these element types I figured I'd take a stab at adding them.\r\n\r\nI ran into some `yarn test` related issues on the way, as I seem to be unable to run the whole test suite (on Windows), only a `yarn test --watch ReactIs` does the trick. Should I file an issue for this?\r\n",
