  "body": "**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen using `history.block` in a component, the browser's back button does not work in Safari (iOS 12)  if the previous route was a route within the app. After tapping the back button, even (react-router) links do not work anymore.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\nPlease note that the react-router team dismissed an issue created for this bug that suspected the `Prompt` component as the cause, with the note that the bug is in the React's `history` object.\r\n\r\n**Test Case**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/freeboarder42/react-safari-history-block-bug-demo\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\n\r\n- Create a simple React app with two components besides App.jsx (Home.jsx, ComponentWithHistoryBlock.jsx)\r\n- Create routings to `Home` and `ComponentWithHistoryBlock` in App.jsx\r\n- Place a link to `ComponentWithHistoryBlock` on `Home`\r\n- Place a link to `Home` on `ComponentWithHistoryBlock`\r\n- Add following code in  `ComponentWithHistoryBlock`:\r\n```\r\nconstructor(props) {\r\n   super(props);\r\n\r\n   const { history } = this.props;\r\n   this.unblock = history.block('Really navigate away?');\r\n}\r\n\r\ncomponentWillUnmount() {\r\n   this.unblock();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- Run the app in Safari on iOS (12)\r\n- Use the link to `ComponentWithHistoryBlock` to go to `ComponentWithHistoryBlock`\r\n- Tap the browser's back button\r\n- Tap the `Home` link\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe browser should go to the `Home` component when tapping the browser's back button. After this did not work, the browser should go to the `Home` component when tapping the Home link.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact: 6.8.2\r\nReact Router: 4.3.1 (just used for routing)\r\nOS: iOS 12.1.4\r\nDon't know if it worked in previous versions of React\r\n\r\n",
