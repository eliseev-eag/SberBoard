But thinking about it, it seems that the \"blind-jumps\" we do now to detect and resolve implicitly added elements (mainly `thead`) appears to not actually be safe as-is. Personally I feel like the solution is to not resolve implicitly added elements at all, but rather tell the user of his/her error instead and have them fix it.\n\nRelated PR #1987 (Provide a friendly path for reactID errors in ReactMount)\n",
