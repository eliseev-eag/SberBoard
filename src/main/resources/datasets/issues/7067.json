  "body": "Hey folks!\n\nI'm the maintainer of [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized). I've recently been focused on trying to squeeze better FPS out of the components while scrolling. To help with this I created a test harness that scrolls a lot and measures FPS while doing so. The test harness lets me measure different versions of react-virtualized _and_ different versions of React in order to compare their performance.\n\nWhile testing, I've discovered a consistent drop in performance between React 15.0.2 and 15.1.0 (15.1.0 being slower). I've observed this for Chrome, Safari, and Firefox (latest versions, OS X 10.11.4) and so I wanted to share it with you.\n\nPerhaps I'm doing something silly?\n### Test harness\n- [React 15.0.2](http://rawgit.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized/master/playground/grid-test.html?react=15.0.2)\n- [React 15.1.0](http://rawgit.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized/master/playground/grid-test.html?react=15.1.0)\n### Instructions to reproduce\n- Load the page\n- Open the console\n- Click anywhere on the body to start the test\n- Wait for it to complete and it will log average FPS and total time information.\n\nThe test will run a minimum of 5 times (potentially longer, until it satisfies the confidence interval). Upon completion it will print the average frame rate across the test.\n### Source code\n\nIn case it's helpful, here's the test code:\n- Test case: https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized/blob/master/playground/grid-test.js\n- Test runner: https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized/blob/master/playground/test-runner.js\n",
