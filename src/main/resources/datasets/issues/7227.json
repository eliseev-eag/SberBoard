  "body": "In my javascript frameworks benchmark I ran into a performance regression for react.\nTo reproduce open [the react.js 15.2 version](http://stefankrause.net/js-frameworks-benchmark2/react-v15.2.0/index.html) and open the console.\nRepeat three times the following: Click \"Create 10,000\" then click \"Clear\"\nYou'll get a result like that:\nrunLots took 1905.0000000000005\nclear took **1997.0249999999996**\nrunLots took 1813.8500000000004\nclear took **4208.895**\nrunLots took 1806.864999999998\nclear took **401.119999999999**\n\nNow repeat the same for [react.js 0.14.8](http://stefankrause.net/js-frameworks-benchmark2/react-v0.14.8/index.html) and you'll get something like that:\nunLots took 2938.8900000000003\nclear took **399.2250000000013**\nrunLots took 2726.365\nclear took **383.45500000000175**\nrunLots took 2872.625\nclear took **381.7250000000058**\n\n(Measurement on Chrome 51 on MacOS 10.11.5 on a MBP 15)\n\nNotice that clear is a lot slower for the first two runs for React v 15, but the third clear run performs about the same for both react versions.\n\nThe source code can be found in the [repository](https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark) of my benchmark. \n",
