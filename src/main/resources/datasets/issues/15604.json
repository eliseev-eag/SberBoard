  "body": "To move React Native to standard path-based imports instead of Haste, the RN renderer that is generated from the code in this repo needs to use path-based imports as well since the generated code is vendored by RN. This commit makes it so the interface between the generated renderers and RN does not rely on Haste and instead uses a private interface explicitly defined by RN. This inverts control of the abstraction so that RN decides the internals to export rather than React deciding what to import.\r\n\r\nOn RN's side, a new module named `react-native/Libraries/ReactPrivate/ReactNativePrivateInterface` explicitly exports the modules used by the renderers in this repo. (There is also a private module for InitializeCore so that we can import it just for the side effects.) On React's side, the various renderer modules access RN internals through the explicit private interface.\r\n\r\nThe Rollup configuration becomes slimmer since the only external package is now `react-native`, and the individual modules are instead listed out in `ReactNativePrivateInterface`.\r\n\r\nTask description: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/24770\r\nSister RN PR (needs to land before this one): https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/24782\r\n\r\nTest Plan: Ran unit tests and Flow in this repo. Generated the renderers and manually copied them over to the RN repo. Ran the RN tests and launched the RNTester app.",
