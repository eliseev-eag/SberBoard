  "body": "This just makes sure we're on the latest. This does come with a change that needs to be called out - that shallowCompare now treats NaN as the same value, and some other tiny equality related changes. This is because fbjs now uses Object.is to compare values. We talked about this a bit in #5773. The result here is that our \"mutated style\" warning will have fewer false positives and specifically will no longer warn for the NaN case (thus the updated test).\n",
