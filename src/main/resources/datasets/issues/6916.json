  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nReport a bug\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\nWhen a form element disappears as the result of a state change (e.g., triggered by an onClick handler on the submit button), its onSubmit handler is not called. In HTML, even if a form element is removed from the DOM, its onSubmit handler is still called.\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\nPlain JS + HTML version (expected behavior): https://jsfiddle.net/b22925dw/\nReproduced in React: https://jsfiddle.net/yaf6p0ga/1/\n_The commented-out setTimeout in the react code is a usable hack to fix it for the time being_\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nThe code specified in the form's onSubmit should be executed before the form disappears.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\nReact 15.0.2 / Chrome 51.0.2704.63 (64-bit) / OS X 10.11.5\n",
