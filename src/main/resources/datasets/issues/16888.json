Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact: N/A  \r\n\r\n```bash\r\n▶ lsb_release -a\r\nNo LSB modules are available.\r\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\r\nDescription:    Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS\r\nRelease:        18.04\r\nCodename:       bionic\r\n\r\n▶ google-chrome --version\r\nGoogle Chrome 77.0.3865.75\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis worked in previous versions of chrome/chrome extension, but I'm not sure when exactly the bug surfaced, since I haven't used it in a while.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help, React is awesome :)",
