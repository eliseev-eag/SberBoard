Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/oshan/x7at18h4/3/)\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact version 16.7.0, React dom version 16.7.0\r\nBrowsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox \r\n",
