  "body": "This PR adds support for event responder having `rootEventTypes` without needing to dynamically add them during a target event type in `onEvent`.\r\n\r\nLike `targetEventTypes`, event responders now support `rootEventTypes` as an array of possible events. To properly track these and unmount them, the event component instance object has a `rootEventTypes` property that we use for tracking the mounting/unmounting of root events. Also and `invariant` has been added to ensure we don't add duplicate root event types â€“ otherwise, when we remove a root event type things will fall out of sync.",
