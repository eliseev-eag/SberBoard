Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/03o0pnor6w\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\nimport { renderToString } from \"react-dom/server\";\r\n\r\nlet Theme = React.createContext(\"light\");\r\n\r\nlet Throw = () => {\r\n  throw new Error(\"some error\");\r\n};\r\n\r\ntry {\r\n  renderToString(\r\n    <Theme.Provider value=\"dark\">\r\n      <Throw />\r\n    </Theme.Provider>\r\n  );\r\n} catch (e) {}\r\n\r\n// this should log \"light\" since it's the default value and\r\n// there's no provider in the tree but it logs \"dark\" instead\r\nconsole.log(renderToString(<Theme.Consumer>{x => x}</Theme.Consumer>));\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThrowing an error from a component while server rendering shouldn't change the default value of context.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI think this is broken in all versions of React with new context. (Here's a codesandbox of the issue with React 16.3.0, https://codesandbox.io/s/l945mq008l) It also only happens while server rendering, it works correctly in the browser (https://codesandbox.io/s/mm10ov8688)",
