  "body": "There are a couple changes here. The most important are that this brings us up to compatibility with 0.14 (mostly just using `ReactDOM` where appropriate). The other thing is that we stop trying to use JSXTransformer, which we aren't even building so these are all broken right now. And lastly, I took this opportunity to stop bundling 3rd party code (es5-shim, sham, console, jquery, bootstrap) and just point at CDNs. This does mean that the examples will require an internet connection to actually run but I think that's ok - I don't care about the airplane case as much anymore.\n\nI left the [server-rendering example](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/examples/server-rendering) alone because I think I want to delete it. It's confusing to follow and run, and I think there are enough resources around on server rendering.\n",
