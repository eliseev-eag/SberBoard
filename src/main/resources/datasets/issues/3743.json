  "body": "I shipped jstransform 0.11, which now has the CLI and API from react-tools. The intention was to deprecate react-tools entirely so we have 1 less thing to support (and it lets us ship transform updates outside the React release cycle). I'm not sure if we just won't ship react-tools 0.14 at all or if it'll basically re-ship jstransform.\n\nIf you're a hawk and watching this repo, and wondering what that means for you, here are your options:\n- Switch to jstranform. I wrote [a migration guide](https://github.com/facebook/jstransform#migration-guide) for you.\n- Switch to babel. It supports many of the same things jstransform does and more.\n- Do nothing. We don't really suggest this but it's an option. We won't un-ship react-tools from npm so as long as you used versions correctly, you should be able to keep chugging along.\n- [x] remove transforms from here\n- [x] make sure our build still works\n- [x] make a react-tools that still works like the one we have\n- [x] make sure JSXTransformer still works (did not make a new one of these for jstranform).\n",
