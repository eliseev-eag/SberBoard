  "body": "I just created a PR for an issue with `ReactTransitionGroup`: https://github.com/jedwards1211/react/pull/1\n\nI was able to use this with 0.13 for a long time by using my own fork of `ReactTransitionGroup`, which of course relies on\n\n```\nvar ReactTransitionChildMapping = require(\"react/lib/ReactTransitionChildMapping\"); \n```\n\nBut it looks like in 0.14 this kind of approach will no longer be possible, and `flattenChildren` is deeply intertwined with a lot of React internals.\n\nIf it were possible to use the same internals that `ReactTransitionGroup` does, people could create innovative new components.  For example, I have long wanted to create a variation that automatically staggers child entry, even if children are all added at the same time, for the classic staggered animation effect.  That would be quite useful, no?\n",
