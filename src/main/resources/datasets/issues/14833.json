  "body": "As I am using React from last 2 years. I think React Hooks would be major change, if it keeps the spirit of React & it's methods. It would definitely give the benefits, state management library would be less in use. I think with React Hooks we can simplify & modify the context props as well, for the better \"state\" management of the data, as what I feel ?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hear from you,",
