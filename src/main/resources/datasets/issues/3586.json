  "body": "I had an idea: what if our stack traces looked more like this so you don't just have 30 frames inside React and then a top-level render call, which is the typical situation nowadays?\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6820/6995020/aacf7f9e-dae2-11e4-9959-d4914cae5123.png)\n\nTurns out we can do this with a small hack. Each time we create an element, we store away a function that just calls its argument:\n\n``` js\nvar foo = React.createElementDebug(function element_Foo(x) { x(); }, Foo, ...);\n```\n\nthen when we go to mount the component, we call this function with the mount code as argument so that it appears on the stack.\n\nThis is a little crazy and probably slow, but could make development nicer. You can't inspect the props (e.g., `a`, `b`, `c` here) but if we had the function capture those vars I think you could.\n",
