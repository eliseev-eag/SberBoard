  "body": "This PR is related to issue #11299 â€“ Express more tests via public API\r\n\r\nI've managed to rewrite the `EnterLeavePlugin` tests using public API, but I'm not sure if I'm on the right path. What I did was basically analyze what was being done inside `EnterLeaveEventPlugin.js` and move the needed parts to the test (which luckily led to a much simpler code).\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense? Happy to make any necessary changes or follow a different path if need be.\r\n\r\nThanks for the opportunity of contributing! :)",
