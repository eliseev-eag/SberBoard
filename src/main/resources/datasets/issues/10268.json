  "body": "The initial problem was that I was relying on `yarn prettier` to update all files. By default it only updates modified files though, and since I had only modified the prettier script itself- it wasn't picking up on a bunch of files. Running `node scripts/prettier/index.js` directly (like CI does) checks all files though and so we had a mismatch.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the files that were skipped.\r\n\r\nI also updated the script so that if mismatching files are found, we actually print them (instead of just saying \"the list above\" when there is none).\r\n\r\nExample output:\r\n![screen shot 2017-07-24 at 1 31 14 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/28543373-67537674-7074-11e7-9c85-2dfdb64ae134.png)\r\n",
