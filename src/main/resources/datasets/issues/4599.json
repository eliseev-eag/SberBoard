  "body": "To support arrow functions and plain functions as \"components\" we need to know if we can call new on them. Examples that won't work:\n\n``` js\nfunction PlainFunctionComponent(props) {\n  return null;\n}\n\nvar ArrowFunctionComponent = (props) => <div />;\n\nclass ClassComponent {\n  render() {\n    return <div><PlainFunctionComponent /><ArrowFunctionComponent /></div>;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe need to detect if a component is a \"function\" or a \"class\" before calling `new` on it.\n\nWe can call `new` on everything if they're plain functions as long as they return a `ReactElement`. However, that won't work for null/false/string return values and we want to support those too. We also can't call `new` on arrow functions. Likewise, we can't NOT call `new` on classes.\n\nUnfortunately ECMAScript doesn't have a way to detect if something is `new`able or not.\n\nThe current plan is to add our own static flag to React.Component so that we can detect if something is a class.\n\nAny class pattern that doesn't require `new` should still be possible:\n\n``` js\nfunction ModuleComponent(props) {\n  return {\n    render() {\n      return <div />;\n    }\n  };\n}\n```\n\nI'm not sure how we can distinguish this pattern from one that requires `new` for warnings though. :(\n",
