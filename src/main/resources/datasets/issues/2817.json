  "body": "In my component I used a private member `this._renderedComponent`, not knowing that this was also used by React. Because I overwrote that variable, I got strange errors at completely unrelated points in time. It took a while to figure out that React itself used a private member of the same name, and that this was exposed inside the component.\n\nWould it be useful to actually hide those variables? Or otherwise to mention them in the documentation, so it's easily findable?\n",
