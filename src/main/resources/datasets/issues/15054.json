(The debugger statement is never hit).\r\n\r\nThe code that I have using the component is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport {mount} from 'enzyme';\r\n\r\ndescribe('Form component', () => {\r\n  test('exposes a ref', async () => {\r\n    let formRef;\r\n    mount(<Form ref={ref => (formRef = ref)}>{() => <span>test</span>}</Form>);\r\n    await pause(500); // this is just a setTimeout to give time for the hooks to run.\r\n    expect(formRef.setErrors).toBeDefined();\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/v8rqy75mn5\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nCallback should be called and returned value should be used as the ref.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"react\": \"16.8.0-alpha.1\",\r\n    \"react-dom\": \"16.8.0-alpha.1\",\r\n    \"enzyme\": \"3.8.0\",\r\n    \"enzyme-adapter-react-16\": \"1.8.0\",\r\n```\r\n",
