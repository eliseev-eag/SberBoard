Server: \"Â©\" Client: \"©\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI don't expect there to be a mismatch. This only occurs with renderToNodeStream and renderToStaticNodeStream and doesn't occur when using renderToString or renderToStaticMarkup.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.1.1\r\nChrome 62+\r\nManjaro Linux\r\n\r\nNot sure if this worked in previous versions.\r\n",
