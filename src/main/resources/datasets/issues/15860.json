  "body": "Those are technically separate but I figured I'd put them in one PR instead of many small ones. I can separate if you prefer.\r\n\r\nCommits:\r\n* e8f6894cabd018c07b250c1fd2ad28cbdadb68a0: Fixing an existing test to test the correct thing. It was supposed to test the annotation but I additionally had a variable rename there due to copy pasta. So I cleaned it up.\r\n\r\n* 892930df25b2824ada260be54038eb0faf9dd293: This adds a new heuristic. If you edit `useState()` argument, like `useState(0)` -> `useState(1)`, we'll remount. This will reinitialize the state, as you'd expect. This heuristic isn't perfect, e.g. it won't capture edits to a constant outside the parens, but it's good enough for the common case. I had to adjust a bunch of existing tests which started failing because of it.\r\n\r\n* 9e9a9ddedd588fdbf380b025a3166790fdf8a33b: This makes it easy for the module system integration to determine whether there's any hot update that needs to be applied.\r\n\r\n* 6a062a3e96686c5300e173d0db025fcfdb52d0f5: A reincarnation of https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15688. That approach was bad because it highlighted nodes *after* hot update. That is distracting because you just want to see the new thing. Instead, I'm going with highlighting likely affected component *before* hot update is applied. So we can highlight the \"old version\", wait for update to come in (~100-200ms), and then replace it. This commit doesn't add any actual highlighting, but it adds the infrastructure necessary for it. Such as ability to query closest host nodes by a set of families. I verified it works and is sufficient in my playground.\r\n\r\nThe theme of this PR is to get to feature complete on the React side. The rest is integration.",
