  "body": "Hi there,\n\nSorry to open an issue here, but we used to leverage the mechanism of `data-react-id` to identify an element in GUI automation testing framework like Selenium. (We are using inline-style and add several unique keys to different components)\n\nThis works well in current version, but seems `data-react-id` [gonna be removed in React 15](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/#document.createelement-is-in-and-data-reactid-is-out). I have not tried with the new RC version yet, but just wondering how should we do in React 15?\n",
