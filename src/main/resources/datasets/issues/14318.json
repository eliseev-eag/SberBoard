Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nUse `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` without `componentDidUpdate`\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIn the use case that I want to get the bounding rect of the DOM element before update by using `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`, ResizeObserver will trigger the update if DOM rect changes and compare for the change to do FLIP animation, which I don't need to do anything on `componentDidUpdate`.\r\nI think it's legit so we shouldn't warning!\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
