  "body": "While testing I wanted to simulate `mouseEnter` and `mouseLeave` events, but for some reason they are not firing the handlers in the component.\n\nHere's a fiddle to show you: http://jsfiddle.net/leoasis/RH2vm/\nYou'll see that with the Simulate functions, only the click is actually triggered, while the other ones not. With the real events everything works perfectly.\n\nI tried to debug a little bit what's going on, but didn't get much information, especially since it's the first time I'm diving into the events mechanism internals in React.\n\nIf you want more info, then I can try and dig a bit deeper, but I think the fiddle is clear enough.\n",
