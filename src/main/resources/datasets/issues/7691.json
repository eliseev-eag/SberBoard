  "body": "Mostly following up on https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7642#issuecomment-244517229. \n\n`BeforeInputEventPlugin` returns `[null, null]` a lot - I think every time an event dispatches. I also think this leads to a bunch of null/empty checks later down the event pipeline that could be eliminated, though I didn't address them here (maybe they would get easier to identify as Flow types trickle down).\n\nThis also saves an array on every single event dispatch, which may or not be substantial, but the fix is straightforward, so I thought I'd give it a try.\n",
