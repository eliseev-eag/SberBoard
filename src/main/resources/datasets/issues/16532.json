  "body": "This includes a bunch of clean up to set up for selective hydration.\r\n\r\nPrimarily the bug it fixes is that we attach event listeners while hydrating but these need to be noops (and later replayable) until we actually commit. Since the parent may not be mounted any setStates that we let through might become invalid.\r\n\r\nThere's no way around that we need some commit-phase effect to indicate when it's done. We could do these on all event listeners but it's sufficient to just do it at the root of the things we're hydrating.\r\n\r\nIn fact, we did that with HostRoot already by attaching a fake Placement effect tag on it.\r\n\r\nThis PR formalizes that by making Hydrating a new effect tag. It means that this is the beginning of a in-progress hydrating subtree. The tag gets removed in the commit phase to indicate that the tree is mounted. Same as Placement.",
