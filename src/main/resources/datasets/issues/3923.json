  "body": "As per https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3919, our tests currently only pass in the browser when running in Chrome because when webcomponents.js is actually loaded, it's currently getting packaged into react-test because we're requiring it. It creates a new Node which is resulting in nodes we create with createNodeFromMarkup to have a different prototype than what is expected in WebComponents. WebComponents's new Node prototype has a different implementation of insertBefore which does an instanceof Node check which our nodes are failing.\n\nThis PR explicitly checks for PhantomJS (probably not strictly necessary, since we had the try-catch there before, but Paul asked for a check).  Also loads webcomponents.js for tests before any of the other javascript.\n\nThere are still a couple of tests failing in my Firefox, but presumably that's unrelated.  We can investigate those tests further tomorrow.  In the mean time, this diff should be ready to land.\n\ncc @zpao \n\nFixes #3919\n",
