  "body": "**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nNo documented way to easily manipulate components/state/props from a third-party perspective.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior is to have a mechanism similar to the [AngularJS injector](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.injector) that allows additional compilation after bootstrapping.  All versions of React, to my knowledge, are affected by this issue.  I've tried reverse-engineering the React Dev Tools and browserify-ing them but it will not be a long-term sustainable solution with constant updates being made to the React codebase.\r\n\r\n**Use Cases**\r\n\r\n* Any time an enterprise-level or multi-party deployment has a third-party that wants to modify presentation/data (e.g. Deploying A/B tests on the client-side, where it would not be ideal to integrate the code as part of the main/back-end deployment unless the A/B test performs better than the control)\r\n* Easily allowing third-party integrations (e.g. Browser extensions editing client-side presentation or utilizing model data)\r\n* Any time something needs to be deployed front-end quickly without being tied to release cycles of back-end code\r\n* Any time a third party wants to modify something without being required to be on-boarded as a contractor due to sensitive sensitive or private data (i.e. PII, HIPAA, etc.)\r\n* Front-end unit testing",
