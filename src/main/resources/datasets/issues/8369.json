  "body": "Trying to build a nifty animation for launching dialogs but running into a snag with ReactCSSTransitionsGroup. The goal is to ensure that the dialog looks like its zooming out of the button that launched it. [Here is a sample that shows the working demo and unexpected behavior](https://jsfiddle.net/bqbj2z24/20/).\r\n\r\nThe unexpected behavior exhibited is the following\r\n\r\n1. Click on the first button (either one). Works perfectly.\r\n1. Click on the second button, the enter animation does not play.\r\n1. Doesn't matter how many buttons you add, only the first works as expected. All additional buttons won't show the enter animation properly.\r\n1. The leave animation works for all buttons.\r\n\r\nI've reproduced this with glamor and aphrodite so feels good to rule out the CSS library as the culprit.  \r\n\r\nTrying to figure out if there's something wrong with the code, unintended usage of ReactCSSTransitionsGroup or a bug with it.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nalso posted on [SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40728125/reactcsstransitionsgroup-with-dynamic-styles-doesnt-execute-enter-animation-pro)",
