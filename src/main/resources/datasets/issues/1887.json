  "body": "I have a component which calls another method in `componentDidMount`. I'm testing with jest and I want to replace the method to be called with a mock so I can verify that it is being called. What's the correct way to do this? I tried replacing the method on `componentDescriptor.type.prototype` but that didn't seem to have any effect because of the auto-binding in react. So for now I've resorted to replacing the method on `componentDescriptor.__reactAutoBindMap` which of course is not ideal, since it uses react internals. Is there a better way which I'm currently missing?\n\nUpdate: in 0.11 the path is now `componentDescriptor.type.prototype.__reactAutoBindMap` - the question persists though.\n",
