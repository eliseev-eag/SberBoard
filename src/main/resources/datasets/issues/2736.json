  "body": "```\nError: Minified exception occurred; use the non-minified dev environment for the full error\nmessage and additional helpful warnings. in /build.js on line (of invariant implementation)\n```\n\nPerhaps there are larger issues preventing this, but considering production errors encountered by a user rarely has access to stack traces, so you only get the single top-level error location... if an error is thrown by React today that's all you know, an error was thrown.\n\nIt would be nice if `invariant(...)` was replaced with `if (...) throw new Error(...)` instead. I could then report vaguely meaningful error locations which could at least hint at what the error is, React would also avoid the invariant invocation overhead then.\n\ncc @zpao @sebmarkbage @spicyj \n",
