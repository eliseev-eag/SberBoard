  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI really love React, especially with the new hooks API, but I have issues with the bundle size.\r\n\r\nReact 16.9.0 takes 131kB of my bundle. And I also need to ship my code and some other packages.\r\n\r\nThis makes the time to interactive on older phones slow.\r\n\r\nI serve the bundle compressed, but it is still a lot of CPU cycles processing javascript. My point is that 131kB of JS !== 131kB of jpg image.\r\n\r\nThe bundle size of react is creeping up all the time. Maybe React could benefit from some bundle limit, let's say 70kB?\r\n\r\nI know that there is Preact that has only 3kB gzipped, but I am not sure if it is as stable as React.\r\n\r\nIs there a plan to work on the bundle size?\r\n\r\n<img width=\"742\" alt=\"react\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18726534/64520304-253c3000-d2f6-11e9-9b42-3a69c02c032d.png\">\r\n\r\nthank you",
