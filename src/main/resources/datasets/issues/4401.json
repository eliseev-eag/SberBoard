  "body": "Validating checksums is surprisingly expensive.  For a reasonable render, we're wasting 10ms+ generating an adler32.  Double that, because the checksum needs to be generated twice (once on the server, once on the client).\n\nI'm creating this bug more to test the waters than anything else... how do we feel about only doing this check in dev mode?  And failing harder in dev mode if we fail the check (since it would become a very serious problem in production because we would no longer be validating the checksum and thus the expected markup could differ from actual).\n\nIt's hard to justify spending so many valuable milliseconds generating a sanity check that we fully expect to pass if developers write their code correctly.\n",
