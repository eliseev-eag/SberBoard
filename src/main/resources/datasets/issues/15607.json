  "body": "Hi! I'm new here. \r\nSo, I've been using react for quite sometime, and recently came across how environment variables are named. Why is it that custom env variables in the .env file must always being with \"REACT_APP_\"? This sometimes tends to get inconvenient. Is there a specific reason for this?\r\nHas a fix been issued?\r\nI could not find a lot of information regarding why this is so. Would be really helpful if someone could help me out here! :)",
