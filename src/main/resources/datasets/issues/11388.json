Which is not a huge deal, as we used to only support synchronized versions, but we agreed that we want to relax that a little bit.\r\n\r\nSo I put a shim back in. I verified that it fails without it:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"773\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-10-27 at 4 47 42 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/32113104-2f092396-bb37-11e7-8406-49cc626a7037.png\">\r\n\r\nand works with it:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"331\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-10-27 at 4 48 52 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/32113108-343ff178-bb37-11e7-8c7d-8f013508c362.png\">\r\n\r\nAs a followup I propose to add Flow types for cross-package internals so we donâ€™t accidentally break them within a major.",
