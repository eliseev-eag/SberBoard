  "body": "I think we should get it in before 16.\r\n\r\nIt updates the link from the warning to point to the DOM blog post. We can then change it to docs once they're in place. The link that is in the code now points to the old behavior, and we can't change it because we want 15 to still point to it.\r\n\r\nIt also updates the wording to make it correct. The wording we have now is more about the old behavior (prop being invalid) rather than new one (value itself being invalid).\r\n\r\n<s>One final minor change is that I now use `Invalid` when I talk about values, and `Unknown` when I talk about names. Not saying it's the greatest scheme ever but IMO it's better than the arbitrary distinction we have now (almost all say `Unknown` but one says `Invalid` for no specific reason).</s>\r\n\r\nAfter discussion, I changed it to consistently using `Invalid` when talking about misspellings, and `Unknown` in other cases. I thought about using `Misspelled` but that isn't very fair to `class`. Maybe we can add a separate message for `class` later and point people to an HTML -> JSX compiler?\r\n\r\nThis only changes strings.",
