  "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nI ran across some weird behavior while implementing some autoplaying video on a recent project. The video is part of an array of modules, and when this array was reordered, the video would stop in Safari on Mac, only to be rendered again. I were eventually able to reproduce this \"resetting\" behaviour consistently between all browsers with CSS animations and transitions.\r\n\r\nThis simple example shows the issue quite well: https://jsfiddle.net/ostrgard/rL33d4wL/\r\n\r\nEach of the numbers has an animation that runs once, that animates the element 100px to the right, and back again. You'll see this when the page loads. This animation should never be replayed... unless I've completely misunderstood something. Each number is also set as the key.\r\n\r\nThe buttons reorders the array. Clicking from \"1,2,3\" to \"1,3,2\" resets the animation for \"2\". Clicking from \"1,2,3\" to \"3,2,1\" resets the animation for \"2\" and \"1\". \r\n\r\nWhat is happening here? I'd expect the behaviour to never reset an animation or otherwise cause the browser to remove an element and insert a new one.\r\n\r\nA few pointers:\r\n1. ~~In Chrome DOM inspector, dragging one element node above the other does not reset animation.~~\r\n2. Changing the items to a React component and logging it's unmount proves there's no unmounting. This seems to be outside of the component lifecycle.\r\n3. I first encountered this issue with React 15.3.0 and the fiddle is using 15.5.4.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading. I'm looking forward to hear your thoughts and learn something from this :)\r\n\r\nPS. I am amazed, that every other browser besides Safari is able to continue the video with this behaviour. I suspect it has something to do with Safari using Quicktime.",
