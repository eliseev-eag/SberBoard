I notice that I have the use of `PureComponent` very often in code, but I'm wondering if there is a way in which you build all pure function components and then apply the logic of shallow comparison before rendering while rendering component using ReactDOM.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason not to have something like this? What do you guys think?",
