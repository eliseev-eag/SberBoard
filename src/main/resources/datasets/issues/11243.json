  "body": "It was a bit hard to say what's being tested there.\r\nThis was relevant in the past but today the only special case we have for Jest is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/49d4381c677cc33b93382611168a140af38a1df9/src/renderers/shared/fiber/ReactChildFiber.js#L1450-L1452\r\n\r\nand here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/49d4381c677cc33b93382611168a140af38a1df9/src/renderers/shared/server/ReactPartialRenderer.js#L412-L415\r\n\r\nSo I just test those specifically instead now.\r\n\r\nThe automock system is also legacy, and has been disabled by default on www this year. The other things these tests were testing are related to *Jest mocking itself* but it doesn’t make sense for me that *we* should test Jest. Especially since we don’t necessarily use the same version as www. If Jest breaks any of this behavior, they will notice it during their www sync so it shouldn’t be on our plate.\r\n\r\nSee individual commits for details.",
