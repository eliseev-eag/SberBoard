  "body": "```\n<div>{/* */}</div>\n```\n\nIs transformed to:\n\n```\nReact.DOM.div(null, /* */)\n```\n\nNote the trailing `,` - this results in a syntax error.\n\nThe problem seems to be with comma insertion in `visitReactTag()` and related functions (e.g, `renderXJSLiteral()`). See IRC discussion below for my findings.\n\nRelevant parts of an IRC discussion:\n\n```\n12:33:47 PM <parshap> JSX comments seem buggy - `<div>{/* comment */}</div>` generates `React.DOM.div(null, /* comment */)` - which is a syntax error\n12:40:52 PM <@lbljeffmo> def looks like a bug -- that comma shouldn't be there. File an issue? (or better -- look into the transform and see if you can send a PR? :) https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/vendor/fbtransform/transforms )\n1:21:30 PM <parshap> lbljeffmo: looks like comment nodes are of type `XJSExpressionContainer` with an inner expression of type `XJSEmptyExpression` - does this sound like the right thing to be looking for?\n1:22:12 PM <@lbljeffmo> parshap: off the top of my head, yea that sounds about right\n1:35:50 PM <parshap> lbljeffmo: It doesn't look like it will be possible to fix without a nontrivial refactor of `visitReactTag()`. The problem is that the commas are injected from several different callsites, often when the next node is not in scope to test wether it is a comment (e.g., inside `renderXJSLiteral()`. I don't have much more time to spend on it so I will just open\n1:35:50 PM <parshap> an issue.\n1:38:31 PM <parshap> lbljeffmo: looks like you've already worked on this issue? https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/82#issuecomment-19589375\n1:38:59 PM <@balpert> parshap: that was #136\n1:39:00 PM <@lbljeffmo> parshap: that was just to add support for XJSEmptyExpression in the parser\n1:39:00 PM <+reactbotx> Issue 136: Add support for empty XJS expressions https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/136\n1:39:21 PM <@balpert> syranide's diff might fix that comment thing though, I dunno\n1:39:43 PM <@lbljeffmo> parshap: understand if you don't have the time. Thanks for looking though -- if you want to open an issue and include all the info you found that would be super helpful\n```\n",
