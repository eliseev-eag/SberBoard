  "body": "While going through the `lib` source of React, after an NPM install, I noticed some blocks like this:\n\n``` js\n// EventPropagators.js, line 41\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n  process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' ? warning(domID, 'Dispatching id must not be null') : undefined;\n}\n```\n\nAll calls to warning() feature their own ternary environment check, so wrapping it in an environment conditional seems unnecessary.\n\nI've already gone through and found/replaced most of the instances, but I wanted to see if there was a philosophical reason for this before submitting a PR.\n\nThanks!\n",
