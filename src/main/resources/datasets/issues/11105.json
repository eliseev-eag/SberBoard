  "body": "Frankly I'm not sure whether it is strictly necessary to do \"always call the base constructor with props\", but it is mentioned [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-local-state-to-a-class) so I think this should be enforced in the documentation at the very least.\r\n\r\nSome of the test fixtures in `/src` have components which do not call the `super()` with `props` as well. I can make a PR to fix those if you like.\r\n\r\nAlso, I understand that the docs page is undergoing migration at the moment. If I should be making doc changes in the new repo or hold off further changes until the migration is complete, do let me know.",
