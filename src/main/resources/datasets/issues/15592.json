  "body": "__TLDR__: Specifying keys when mapping from data to components feels wrong to me even after several years. It would be really nice if components could specify their own `key` instead.\r\n\r\nThis is how you supply keys when rendering a list of components:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst User = ({ name, email }) => (\r\n  <div>{name}, {email}</div>\r\n);\r\n\r\nconst View = ({ users }) => (\r\n  <div>{users.map(user => <User key={user.email} {...user} />)}</div>\r\n); \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has always felt dirty to me because in order to do render a list of `User`, `View` has to know implementation details about `User`. From a separation of concerns standpoint this feels icky. Also, this creates some sort of tight coupling problem between `User` and any component that needs to render a list of it. If you have many lists of `User` in your app and need to refactor it, best case scenario is you have to do a lot of search-replace and in the worst case you get bugs.\r\n\r\nI wish there was a way for components to handle the mapping of `props -> key` internally. Maybe something like:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst User = ({ name, email }) => (\r\n  <div key={email}>{name}, {email}</div>\r\n);\r\n\r\nconst View = ({ users }) => (\r\n  <div>{users.map(user => <User {...user} />)}</div>\r\n); \r\n```\r\n\r\nMore possible solutions [below](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/15592#issuecomment-491265016).\r\n\r\nIf enough people like this idea I hope you'd consider an official API/solution that allowed this. :) \r\n\r\nEDIT: Removed some arrow function related stuff because in hindsight it making my point confusing.\r\nEDIT: Rewrite of entire post based on @malerba118's [comment](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/15592#issuecomment-491265016)",
