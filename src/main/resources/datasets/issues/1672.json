  "body": "It seems there is no way for a wrapper component to get feedback when its children are changing the layout. I wanted to implement [this demo](http://blog.vjeux.com/2013/javascript/scroll-position-with-react.html) by @vjeux but in the context of a wrapper: http://jsfiddle.net/Pm9ZZ/ Unless I'm doing something wrong (which is quite possible), this does not automatically scroll as in the initial example.\n\nAfter talking with @spicyj on #reactjs he told me this was indeed something that would need to be addressed at one point.\n",
