Open the debugging console\r\n2. Wait 8 secs for setTimeout (line 65) to change state\r\n3. Observe the warning in console: \"Warning: A component is changing a controlled input of type text to be uncontrolled\"\r\n\r\nThis is happening as React is only updating what is necessary on the input elements. React adds the additional properties (placeholder, title, readonly) and changes the existing property \"value\" of the input that is being replaced rather than replacing the entire input. This results in the controlled status changing (DOM's input element persists it's value too).\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe old input element is replaced by the new input (that uses placeholder text). Use case is described in the *origin* section of the CodeSandbox README. Actual desired behavior is unknown.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact version: 16.2.0\r\nChrome version: 64.0.3282.167 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n\r\nDoes not throw the warning (may be production version) and the DOM input value is not persisted.\r\nCodepen: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/gvjgZR?editors=0010\r\nReact version: 13 (I think)",
