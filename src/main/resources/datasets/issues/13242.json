  "body": "as discussed with Dan - context from him below\r\n\r\n> I recently made it so that warning() calls automatically attach the stack. It’s available right in that module https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/shared/warning.js\r\n\r\n> Now that we always have stack info, we can expose it to other tools consistently too\r\n\r\n> In fact Create React App’s error overlay already intercepts console.error calls if a special method called console.reactStack was called before\r\n\r\n> React 15 made console.reactStack calls only for one warning, to test the idea. We never implemented it for other warnings and then didn’t implement it at all in 16\r\n\r\n> Suggestion: take a look at the API that React 15 was calling (search the UMD bundle for console.reactStack calls). Try doing the same in 16, except now in the centralised place (warning module). Use Create React App to check if it worked. When it works it should start showing the error overlay for warnings too, and include component stack as actual frames in the overlay\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# CRA test results (these warnings are what we want):\r\n\r\nexample of using the new exposed `ReactDebugCurrentFrame.currentFiber`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/42966431-224ad23a-8b6b-11e8-84b5-611b19e5e6d3.png)\r\n\r\nexample of using adding the `currentlyValidatingElement` on top of the frames from `ReactDebugCurrentFrame.getStackFrames` (otherwise this would show at `<Test />`):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/42966437-280b668a-8b6b-11e8-9d63-f46e5665fa09.png)\r\n\r\nIn future we may modify react-error-overlay to better show warnings (prior issue: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/1888) but this lays the groundwork to do that",
