Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nEVERYTHING\r\n\r\n\r\nHi all.\r\n\r\nMaybe this isn't a feature request, but more an API choice which I would like to put it the open and maybe try to understand the decision that led to the implementation. So apologies in advance if I just don't get it :)\r\n\r\nWhy does `this.props.children` either render a Child or an array of children? Why can't this be an array of children all the time?\r\n\r\nTake this as an example of a Parent class:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport React, { PureComponent } from 'react';\r\nclass ParentExample extends PureComponent {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>\r\n                { this.props.children.map((Child, i) => (\r\n                    <Child key={i} />\r\n                ))\r\n                }\r\n            </div>\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow if you do something like:\r\n```javascript\r\nreturn (\r\n    <ParentExample>\r\n        <SomeComponent />\r\n        <SomeOtherComponent />\r\n    </ParentExample>\r\n);\r\n```\r\nYou have no problems, cause your `children` prop inside the `ParentExample` is an array. However if you decide that you just want to pass 1 child into it like so:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nreturn (\r\n    <ParentExample>\r\n        <SomeComponent />\r\n    </ParentExample>\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll get an error because the `children` prop inside the `ParentExample` is now a direct reference to the `SomeComponent` instead of an array of children.\r\n\r\nDoesn't it make more sense to always return an array?\r\n\r\nHaving to do this sanitation all the time before rendering the children is a bit silly... Now I might totally  be missing the point here, but shouldn't the name itself be a clue? `this.props.children` children... an array of children. Can be 0, can be 1 can be N... \r\n\r\nOpinions?",
