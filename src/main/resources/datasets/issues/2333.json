  "body": "**Hi**,\n\nI think the article forgot to mention that you need to put\n\n``` json\n\"jest\": {\n  \"rootDir\": \"./whatever\"\n}\n```\n\ninto `package.json` to make the test suite work. Omitting to put these lines to the npm config resulted in a test error. Namely:\n\n``` bash\nFound 1 matching test...\n FAIL  lib/stores/__tests__/Store-test.js (0.022s)\n● Store › it encountered a declaration exception\n  - TypeError: Cannot read property 'INIT' of undefined\n```\n\nI think the suite didn't knew where to find resources. If this was mentioned in the article, then sorry, i didn't find anything about it.\n\nCheers,\nJim\n",
