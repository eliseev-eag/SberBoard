  "body": "Sometimes apps can be tested with multiple renderers at once. Examples - \r\n- react-art being used inside react-dom. This was 'fixed' by disabling missing act warnings for embedded renders https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15975\r\n- ReactDOM.render being used inside another component tree. The parent component will be rendered using ReactTestRenderer.create for a snapshot test or something.\r\n- a ReactDOM instance interacting with a ReactTestRenderer instance (like for the new devtools)\r\n\r\nThis PR is for the other 2 usecases. It replaces the sigil reference with a stack that holds all sigils as act scopes open/close, and compares against the stack for when to show the missing act() warning.\r\n \r\nOpen question - At what point should flushPassiveEffects be called? On exiting the last act of any type? Or for a given type?",
