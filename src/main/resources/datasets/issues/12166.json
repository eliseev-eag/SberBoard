  "body": "A user accidently generated an SSR output using renderToStaticMarkup()\r\ninstead of renderToString(), which was then hydrated using hydrate().\r\nThis led to a warning, caused by collapsed text nodes. According to the\r\nuser, renderToString() would have added HTML comments between them.\r\n\r\nAs an enhancement, the user is requesting that hydrate() issue a warning\r\nwhen the HTML contents of the node it is hydrating is not rendered by\r\nrenderToString().\r\n\r\nResolves #11596\r\n\r\n**Before submitting a pull request,** please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n1.
