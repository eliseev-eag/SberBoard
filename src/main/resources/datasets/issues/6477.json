  "body": "I have a form with a submit button. When the user clicks submit my `handleSubmit` function calls     `this.setState({ submissionTakingPlace: true })`, the re-render then sets a disabled attribute on the submit button. \n\n```\n<button\n type=\"submit\"\n onClick={this.handleSubmit}\n disabled={this.state.submissionTakingPlace}\n>\n```\n\nIn Chrome and Safari the network tabs shows that no POST request even starts? In Firefox the POST occurs. Note I have the same behaviour when I use a `<input>` over a `<button>`.\n\nHere is a Codepen [example](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/GZQNZe). Issue occurs on the latest version of React 15.0.1.\n\nApologies if this is a browser quirk vs a React issue but me and a colleague were pretty confused by it.\n",
