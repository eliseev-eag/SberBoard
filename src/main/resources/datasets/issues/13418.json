Seems https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/package.json#L54 use wrong value `link:` but npm just support [`file:`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#local-paths). I'm not sure why we change `file:` to `link:` in #11977 from the comments\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nNo error\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact repo master branch\r\nMacOs\r\nYes, previous works\r\n",
