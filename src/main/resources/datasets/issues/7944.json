  "body": "Description:\n\nThis PR has a very limited scope. I came across this while working through `ReactDOMComponent.js` for #7911 and found that `var type = this._currentElement.type;` was assigned in a very limited scope within `mountComponent()` on line 618, while `this._currentElement.type` was being in nearly every case explicitly around it.\n\nChanges Proposed:\n- Assign `var type = this._currentElement.type;` higher inside `mountComponent()` to be used everywhere else `this._currentElement.type` is being explicitly written.\n\nIf line 610 is too high up, I could see it being placed after line 612 within the `if (transaction.useCreateElement)` block, since the only case where `type` might go unused is on the block on line 647, within the `else` block for `if (transaction.useCreateElement)`. Let me know what you think.\n\ncc: @gaearon \n",
