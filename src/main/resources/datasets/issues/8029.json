  "body": "This doesn't deal with the fact that work is usually deferred so this will return null for first render (except in sync tests). It also doesn't deal with top levels being fragments etc. This needs to be unified with refs and findDOMNode better.\n\nWe also need to add incremental tests to ensure that the value is expected when render is deferred.\n\nThis is enough to unblock unit tests though.\n\nHowever, this does expose that we reactComponentExpect and ReactTestUtils doesn't work very well with Fiber.\n",
