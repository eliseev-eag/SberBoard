  "body": "**Feature request - Warning for direct state mutation & no mutation on initial state object**\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen directly mutating an array in the react state instance the intialState object is also mutated. While I know updating the state this way is not the correct way, I see no React Warning to help people see that this is an issue and they should make state updates immutable.\r\n\r\nAlso I think the intialState object should not be modified under any circumstances by React, since it could be used to reset the state at some point.\r\n\r\nCode Sandbox demonstrating the issue:\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/peaceful-khayyam-duq8f\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n react@16.9.0\r\n react-dom@16.9.0\r\n Windows 10 Pro 1903\r\n Chrome 77.0.3865.90, Firefox 69.0.1\r\n\r\n\r\n",
