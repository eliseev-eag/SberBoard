  "body": "> A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with ”use” and that **may** call other Hooks.\r\n\r\nSource: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html#extracting-a-custom-hook\r\n\r\nWhat I find misleading is the verb _may_.\r\n\r\nWhat's the point of a custom hook that doesn't call any React's hook internally? It doesn't hook to React's internals... it also needn't to follow the rules of hook, and still works perfectly fine. I would say it is just a normal function whose name starts with _use_. \r\n\r\nAm I missing something?",
