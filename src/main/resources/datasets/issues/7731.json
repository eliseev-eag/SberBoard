When I read this page, it would have been more helpful if I'd been pointed to the spread syntax (I already knew about Immutable.js but I wanted something lighter-weight).\n\nObviously the changes I made here are kind of hacky and don't give a great experience to the reader. But I think that pointing people to these other options is valuable enough that it's worth adding a temporary note like this.\n",
