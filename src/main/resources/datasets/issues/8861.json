  "body": "Continues from PR #7360.\r\n\r\nFirst step toward repurposing the recently-added `ReactFiberErrorLogger` as a more generic `ReactDevInterface`. I am going to abandon this PR (for now) due to time constraints but I'd like to pick it back up in the future.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is:\r\n* `React` provides a default, renderer-agnostic implementation that logs errors and warnings to the console. (This can help with things like Jest tests.)\r\n* Specific renderers (eg DOM, Native) can inject their own UI in order to promote awareness of warnings or to help developers better locate errors.\r\n* Application developers may choose to override renderer UI with their own hooks in order to log errors, direct users to report bugs, etc.\r\n\r\nThis PR is half-baked but it's here for posterity. ðŸ˜„ \r\n\r\n#### UI treatment ideas for DOM\r\n* Yellow box dialog for warnings only: https://jsfiddle.net/f8buL8Lu/\r\n* Toast-style messages for warnings and errors: http://run.plnkr.co/plunks/dsbJMh/\r\n* Modal dialog for warnings and errors: http://run.plnkr.co/plunks/qTLrjL/\r\n\r\n#### Team feedback\r\n* DOM and Native DX should be consistent. Doesn't have to look the same (web has more flexibility in terms of screen real estate and interactions) but should be _familiar_ to devs and should expose the same basic information.\r\n* Warnings and errors may be associated; don't obscure warnings as they're often more helpful in spotting problems than errors.",
