  "body": "First commit makes Fresh integration tests run in two modes: with and without destructuring transform. This adds failing tests because currently we're not resilient to the plugin order issues. If destructuring transform visits our nodes first, we can't recover info about Hook signatures later. (Look at it with `?w=1`.)\r\n\r\nSecond commit solves this problem by adding an early traversal that collects Hook calls. In general early traversals should be avoided. But that's the only way we can collect signatures before they're mangled. To mitigate the perf concern, we make sure this early traversal doesn't do any mutations. So at least it won't have cause cascade issues. It's also very simple. This fixes the new tests.\r\n\r\nThe last commit is just a minor refactoring.\r\n",
