  "body": "**Edit:** This PR has been rebased and no longer has an cruft from previous PRs.\r\n    \r\n---\r\n\r\n**what is the change?:**\r\n- Uses references to global APIs instead of directly calling global APIs themselves inside of exported functions.\r\n- Shim the 'schedule' module itself in `www`, planning to use the generated bundle instead of inlining it.\r\n- Create a `react-scheduler` bundle for `fb-www`\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nContext: internally we polyfill `requestAnimationFrame` and `setTimeout` and other global APIs. These \"polyfills\" also add and modify the functionality of the APIs, in ways that are not compatible with React.\r\n\r\nWe need more control over the version of those APIs that is used by the `schedule` module. To manage this, we want to try loading the `schedule` module before the polyfills are loaded, and holding a reference to the original `requestAnimationFrame` API.\r\n\r\nTo require `schedule` early we need to split it out from React. This diff takes a simple approach to that - we still want `schedule` bundled with React for open source, but internally we want it to be a separate module.\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nI'll run the sync next week and verify that this all works. :)\r\n\r\n**issue:**\r\nSee internal task T29442940",
