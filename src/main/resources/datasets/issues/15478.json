It happened to work in our existing tests because we use virtual time.\r\n\r\nFlow would have caught this if ExpirationTime were an opaque type. We should consider that in the future. (The downside of opaque types is that all operations would have to go through helper functions, which may or may not get inlined by Closure.)",
