  "body": "The current \"style guide\" that is in the contributing docs doesn't cover everything that should be covered. I would like to see that section have a bit more content.\n\nI actually couldn't find a Facebook style guide online publicly anywhere, so this could be a pretty big initiative to have this kind of documentation publicly available. I'm willing to help in this process.\n\nIf the above sounds too ambiguous, we could just add more content to the CONTRIBUTING file.\n",
