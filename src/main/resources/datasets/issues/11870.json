  "body": "**Contributing checklist**\r\n- [X] Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.\r\n- [X] Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n- [ ] If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n- [X] Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n- [X] Run `yarn test-prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n- [X] If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n- [X] Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n- [X] Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n- [X] Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) typechecks (`yarn flow`).\r\n- [X] If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n### Problem : \r\n- Issue https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11768\r\n- Input element in a portal was throwing error only when tested on\r\n  - IE 11\r\n  - Edge 15\r\n  - Edge 14\r\n- Sample jsfiddle https://github.com/kgorgi/react-popout-bug\r\n\r\n### Solution:\r\n- Moved `enumerable` descriptor to another `defineProperty` of same `node` object.\r\n- there are no side effects to this as \r\n> The Object.defineProperty() method defines a new property directly on an object, or modifies an existing property on an object, and returns the object. \r\n- This seems to solve the problem for the browsers mentioned above.\r\n",
