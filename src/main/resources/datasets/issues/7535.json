  "body": "I'm writing a table cell component that will specially handle the case where it's given a single number, and from looking at the documentation and API, I'm unclear on how to do this:\n- [\"Multiple Components\"](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/multiple-components.html#children) and [\"Top-level API\"](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#react.children) say that `this.props.children` is \"opaque\" and suggest that the `React.Children` APIs should be used to preserve  `this.props.children`'s encapsulation.\n- [\"Type of the Children props\"](https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/children-props-type.html) gives full details on how `this.props.children` is implemented and suggests that `React.Children` is provided simply as a convenience.\n- [The docs for `React.Children.only`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#react.children.only) say that `only` gets the single child, but in reality, it gets the single child _as long as that child is a React element_. (React 15.3.1 at least [improves the error message](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7514) in this case.)\n\nMy questions, or suggestions for improvements to the docs:\n- Is `this.props.children` supposed to be opaque? If so, \"Type of the children props\" should be updated.\n- Or is it supposed to be public? If so, \"Multiple Components\" and \"Top-level API\" should be updated.\n- Can the documentation for `React.Children.only` be updated to clarify that it requires a valid React element and possibly to explain the use case for this requirement? (See comments on #1104 for some of the confusion caused by the current documentation.)\\* What's the official or recommended way to get at the only \"anything renderable\" child, as opposed to the only \"valid React element\" child?\n  - Changing `React.Children.only` to allow for string and number nodes was closed as won't fix (#1104)\n  - Using `this.props.children` directly goes against the docs' statement that it should be opaque.\n  - Using `React.Children.map` or `React.Children.forEach` seems like overkill.\n\nIf `this.props.children` is supposed to be opaque, then would a new `React.Children.onlyNode` function be a useful solution?\n",
