  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nComponents using a context update their content upon changes to the context, but `render` and `componentDidUpdate` are not invoked even though the the components' content changes.\r\n\r\n[Here's a JSFiddle example](https://jsfiddle.net/0ewuj8L4/). Note how the component does update (the display on screen changes), but the \"render\" messages are only logged once (to the console), while the \"update\" messages are never logged.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI guess I understand why this is happening - the components which use `Context.Consumer` don't really re-render or get updated when the context changes; only the `Context.Consumer` component does. It would still be appreciated to at least make `componentDidUpdate` get invoked somehow (automatically).\r\n\r\nRegardless, this behavior should certainly be documented as it is quite unclear, unintuitive and not so easy to detect.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nLatest React I guess? I'm running on Windows 10.0.17134.799 and Chrome 75.0.3770.142, but I believe it should replicate on other environments as well.\r\n",
