  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\n\nbug\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\n\nIn IE Edge when rendering a required select box with an initial value set, when trying to submit the form the input will fail validation saying \"You must choose an item from the list\".\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\n1. Visit https://jsfiddle.net/hhgo0y9n/18/ in IE Edge.\n2. Try to submit form.\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n\nThe form should be valid and submit correctly.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\nBrowser: IE Edge (v38 as of testing).\nReact versions: 15 to master (7b247f3609ad25d79ae267b4b5c919a35da45cb4).\n\nWorks in React 0.14.8.\n\n**Notes**\n\nI believe this might be a browser bug but the issue does not occur in React 0.14, perhaps using different apis? \n\nRelated links:\n- https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/291588/\n- https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/details/817091/html5-validation-validity-object-does-not-update-itself-for-select-and-textarea-elements\n- http://jsfiddle.net/NPb5f/\n",
