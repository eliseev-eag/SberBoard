  "body": "I have been going through the codebase to better understand how React works under the hood, when I noticed that `createElement` and `cloneElement` appeared to handle setting props differently, which didn't make sense to me based on what I know about React. After looking closer, I realized that they both actually do the same thing, but the difference in logic threw me off a bit at first glance.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a minor refactor to reuse the shared logic between `createElement` and `cloneElement` so that it is more explicit that the props are set in the same way.",
