  "body": "I believe #5744 introduced a behavioral difference between development and production versions of React. We released it as a part of 15.0, and this difference still exists.\n\nThe production behavior hasn’t changed. However the development behavior diverged after this change.\n\n``` js\nvar el = React.createElement('div', { key: undefined })\ndocument.body.innerHTML = (typeof el.key) + ' ' + el.key\n```\n\nWhat do you expect to appear?\n### 0.14.x\n- Development (https://jsfiddle.net/sjLcmnq6/1/): `object null`\n- Production (https://jsfiddle.net/qro1wck0/1/): `object null`\n## 15.x\n- Development (https://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/43538/):  **`string undefined`**\n- Production (https://jsfiddle.net/rakg6uwy/1/): `object null`\n\nThe 15.x dev behavior is different because [dev code path only checks the existence of a property but not whether it’s undefined](https://github.com/alitaheri/react/blob/c3980a6d08257d39a08bed8b116d53a56344166b/src/isomorphic/classic/element/ReactElement.js#L130-L133) whereas the [prod code path checks for undefined explicitly](https://github.com/alitaheri/react/blob/c3980a6d08257d39a08bed8b116d53a56344166b/src/isomorphic/classic/element/ReactElement.js#L135-L136).\n\n`React.cloneElement()` is not affected because it doesn’t include those warnings.\n\n---\n\nThis doesn’t seem like a major problem (nobody noticed it!) in the real world, but I think we should fix this.\nI have a related fix in the works so I’ll add some more tests and include it.\n",
