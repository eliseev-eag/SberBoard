I dont usually have issues with npm, and I use it for several other projects, and it seems to work fine, I cannot figure out why it's only happening here. I could actually install react and react-dom manually, but when I tried installing react-scripts, it didnt output anything and I had to ctrl+c to get my console back.\r\n\r\nI understand this is not a forum for npm, but as I described, I dont have this issue in other projects, and it works fine doing literally anything else. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n",
