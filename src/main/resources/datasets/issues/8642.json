  "body": "**What is the current behavior?**\r\nUsing `.stopPropagation` in an `onFocus` event on a textarea or its parent causes the cursor to disappear or render at an incorrect location in Firefox.\r\n\r\nYou can see the vanishing cursor [at this fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/aq59me3d/3/). There are no issues on Chrome and Edge, but FireFox 50.1.0 has this problem. In my full app, the cursor doesn't vanish but rather moves elsewhere (italics are placeholder text):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"118\" alt=\"2016-12-25\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2739312/21473053/83e67f52-cac5-11e6-8b6c-1e1f98289bb6.png\">\r\n<img width=\"88\" alt=\"2016-12-25 1\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2739312/21473058/a0e1f168-cac5-11e6-872e-70d8e6d83c93.png\">\r\n<img width=\"66\" alt=\"2016-12-25 2\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2739312/21473055/8836dc5a-cac5-11e6-8adc-4edb65763104.png\">\r\n\r\nI have not reproduced this behavior in the fiddle.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt's hard to say what the expected behavior is, since the real `focus` event does not bubble. [Here](https://jsfiddle.net/axacmxfv/)'s a fiddle to show that the cursor position is not affected when the event is stopped in a vanilla-JS environment.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nThe fiddle shows the issue with `15.4.1` on FF (on Windows 10).  I saw the same issue on `15.3`. \r\n\r\n**Why stopPropagation**\r\nBefore I get eaten alive for using this, I'll just say that having a non-bubbling focus event simplifies one of the interactions I'm setting up. Specifically, my app has a bunch of widgets that can be marked active. When a user clicks into a field in the widget, that widget should be marked active. However, widgets can be nested in other widgets, in which only the inner-most widget should be marked active.",
