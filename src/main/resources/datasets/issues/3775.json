  "body": "Hi all,\n\nWell, I like the project and using it for a few of my own, but I have a gripe... errors.  When refactoring large amounts of code, I find that if I call \n\n```\nsomething = undefined // i forgot to require dependency\nReact.render(<something />, el)\n// super unhelpful error message\n```\n\nI get a very unhelpful error.  There are other ways to error-out react as well, and they also seem to produce unhelpful errors with stack traces that don't escape React most of the time, making it near impossible to debug.\n\nIs it possible for a better stack trace that will tell me what line, or perhaps it would tell me what actually went wrong ( such as I was trying to create an element from undefined )?\n",
