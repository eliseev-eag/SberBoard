  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nThere is a warning shown in the console for a component which has all the following conditions met:\r\n\r\n* it is memoized using `React.memo`\r\n* it uses hooks\r\n* it uses suspense (there is a promise thrown).\r\n\r\nText of that warning: `Warning: ComponentName: Rendered more hooks than during the previous render. This is not currently supported and may lead to unexpected behavior.`\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/71lr16j491\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nNo warning should be shown because the rules of hooks are met. Also, the behavior should be consistent no matter if `React.memo` is used or not.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.8.1",
