This new option would behave like a combination of always and never. Keyboard will always dismiss, but also the events will always be passed down to the children components.\r\n\r\nDoes it make sense? My current use case is that I have a multi line text input that I want to be blurred when anything else is pressed; however, the 'never' option is not useful because it will also mean that children need two taps to be triggered.\r\n",
