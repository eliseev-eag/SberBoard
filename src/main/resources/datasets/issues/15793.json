I have a demo that reproduces the issue consistently. Source is here: https://gist.github.com/aweary/6cd04d4e9475927cdad63cbaae9031a9\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n* Go to http://domineering-sack.surge.sh/\r\n* Wait for the initial suspend to resolve\r\n* Click the \"bar\" button\r\n* If the warning doesn't happen just keep clicking back and forth between \"foo\" and \"bar\" until it does\r\n\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n\r\nYou'll get the warning:\r\n\r\n> `The following components suspended during a user-blocking update: Bar`\r\n\r\nI don't think this is expected, as the update that causes the suspend is already inside `Scheduler.unstable_next`.\r\n\r\n",
