  "body": "Over in the [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) project we would really, really like a \"blessed\" way to access the component that was on the bottom of the render stack at the time another was rendered. `ReactCompositeComponent`s currently have a reference to their \"owner\" component using `this._owner`, but [it looks like it's going to be removed](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/820210fd9e3d18d7c7f3a4550cbcbec1b43fcc43/src/core/ReactCompositeComponent.js#L1083).\n\nI'm currently trying to understand the reasons for wanting to get rid of `_owner` so that we can find a way to satisfy those concerns but still preserve access to a component's owner in some way.\n\nThere are lots of places in the DOM API where you can go back up the tree, including [`parentNode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node.parentNode), [`ownerDocument`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node.ownerDocument), [`parent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.parent), and [`ownerNode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/StyleSheet.ownerNode). Being able to essentially do the same thing in React's component API would be incredibly useful.\n",
