  "body": "Are there other attributes like this that necessitates server rendering?\n\nMost features have corresponding DOM properties that we prefer. There's some case with app cache that I know about as well that only has server-side meaning.\n\nIf this is a more generic problem we might need a way to solve this server-side. We don't want global plugins. The client side solution is just refs and manual manipulation so we generally don't need to fix it. It is uncommon enough and doesn't create ecosystem fragmentation/isolation by global plugins (I learned something from MooTools).\n",
