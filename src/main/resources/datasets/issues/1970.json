  "body": "We're switching Atom to React, but we want to support backward-compatible shims to our previous view framework.\n\nIn the old framework, views were represented as jQuery-wrapped DOM elements. Ideally, we'd like to provide backward-compatible shims by simply rendering the React component and wrapping its root element in a jQuery wrapper with an API that's compatible to our old editor views. That would essentially look like this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar editorRoot = document.createElement('div')\nReact.renderComponentWithRootElement(Editor(props), editorRoot)\n\n// the element would actually be wrapped in a custom subclass of jQuery,\n// but this is clearer for this example\nvar editorShim = $(editorRoot) \n```\n\nCurrently, this isn't possible because React components need to be rendered into a container. So instead we need to create a wrapper element and render the component inside it. This is sad because it adds an extra layer of markup which confuses styling, and also means that the editor has a wrapper when used via the shim layer but no wrapper when embedded as a child via React itself.\n\nIs there something fundamental preventing React from adopting DOM nodes directly without the parent? Is this something we could even hack in in a way that would be somewhat maintainable?\n\n:heart:\n",
