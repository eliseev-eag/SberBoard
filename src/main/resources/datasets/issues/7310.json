  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nfeature request\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\nConsider this code from `ReactNativeAttributePayload.diffProperties()`:\n\n```\n  for (var propKey in nextProps) {\n    attributeConfig = validAttributes[propKey];\n    if (!attributeConfig) {\n      continue; // not a valid native prop\n    }\n```\n\nIf I pass invalid properties on the node, they are simply skipped over.\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nI would like a warning that I'm using some illegal property that's not understood. It would make it much easier to determine why the property I'm trying to set is not taking effect (e.g. because I misspelled the property name or because that property actually doesn't exist on the type I'm trying to set it on). So, I think I'm looking for an assert here (a check that only runs if **DEV** is true). It would probably have to be configurable to support existing code that sets invalid properties on nodes - you can turn it on for strict attribute validation, but it's off by default.\n\nI'm happy to put up a PR to add this, but I don't see configuration for the React Native renderer code. Where could I add a property e.g. `enableStrictAttributeValidation`?\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n15.2.0\n",
