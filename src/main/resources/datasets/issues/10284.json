  "body": "I have been trying to find out why my React event handlers were not able to prevent event handlers on document. After hours of searching and experimenting, I stumbled across issue #7094, which explains it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the documentation at https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/handling-events.html gives the impression that React events work exactly like native events, apart from wrapping them in synthetic events, and could therefore interact with them. Please document that this is not the case.",
