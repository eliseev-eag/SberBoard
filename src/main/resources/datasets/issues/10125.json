  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n*bug*?\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen switching from `v15.6.1`'s `development` into `production` mode, the in the examples below defined curried `onBlur` handler suddenly stops working. It seems to have something to do with the number of arguments.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\nReact `v15.6.1` (`production`, partially working)\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/axc28sfq/\r\n\r\nReact `v15.6.1` (`development`, fully working)\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/z0mp7gv5/\r\n\r\nReact `v15.1.0` (`production`, fully working - _also works fine in `development` mode_)\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/85w1uL3f/\r\n\r\nReact `v16.0.0-alpha.13` (`development`, partially working)\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/z0fystqx/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nWhatever the correct usage of the handler function might be in the end, at least the behavior should stay the same across the different build modes?\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nThis was working fine with `v15.1.0` (`development` and `production`).\r\n",
