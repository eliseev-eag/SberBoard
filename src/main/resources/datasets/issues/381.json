  "body": "My convos with the Chrome team indicated that listening for mousewheel kills some optimizations (agh). We should create a mapping of synthetic event -> set of real events to listen for, and attach listeners only when we need them. The initial diff doesn't even need to worry about removing the listeners, but if we did I think we should do a periodic \"gc\" of the listeners rather than doing it when the last listener is removed since it could lead to thrashing.\n",
