  "body": "When user gets to the \"Storing A History\" part of the React tutorial, the user can easily get lost, as the tutorial briefly becomes vague and without example, at the point of text shown below.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then remove the constructor from Board and change Board so that it takes squares via props and has its own onClick prop specified by Game, like the transformation we made for Square earlier. You can pass the location of each square into the click handler so that we still know which square was clicked:\"\r\n\r\nThe tutorial should reiterate the steps, displaying the final code after Board has been edited as described.  \"...so that it takes squares via props and has its own onClick prop specified by Game\" is vague and to someone who has never used React before.  This step is \"easier said than done\", and does not conform to the level of explanation with examples that the previous portions of the tutorial exhibit.\r\n\r\nLong story short, this point in the tutorial is where it \"falls apart\", and users are likely to just stop out of confusion, and move on to some other tutorial.  This seems to be a critical stepping point that should be \"ironed out\" to be more clear and concise.\r\n",
