  "body": "I'm pretty far from completely understanding what this is doing but generally I think it's something like this…\n1. Brings both implementations of `invokeGuardedCallback` in line. We don't return the return value. Nobody uses it and when we were using events, it wasn't happening anyway.\n2. Flow got unhappy that we weren't passing an `EventListener` as the 2nd arg to add/removeEventListener. Seems that making that return type `void` helped it believe the right thing.\n\nThis seems to make Flow happy internally (not sure what the difference for that is…). This still might not be technically right though - we should make sure it is.\n\ncc @spicyj @vjeux \n",
