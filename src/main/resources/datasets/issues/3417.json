  "body": "The docs at http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-api.html give a use case for `isMounted()` and mention that it is not available for ES6 classes, but don't explicitly call it out as deprecated.\n\nIt would be useful if they clarified what the recommended alternative is.\n\nMost of the uses I have in my existing code are for dealing with the case where a component gets unmounted before a timeout setup for animation etc. after the component is mounted expires.\n",
