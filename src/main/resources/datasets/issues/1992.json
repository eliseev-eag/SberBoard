  "body": "It's quite common to have external APIs that doesn't really belong being a component, but which must/favor being notified when the instance is being unmounted. Currently this can be solved by making the API a mixin, but IMHO it's the wrong solution.\n\nI propose being able to do something like the examples below, I'm well aware that this could (and perhaps should) be implemented as a third-party mixin instead. But it's a common and simple enough use-case that having a unified implementation is at least worth bringing up I think, as it would be useful in bridging many APIs (without the use of mixins).\n\n**EDIT:** Published an experimental mixin: https://github.com/syranide/react-unmount-listener-mixin\n\n``` JS\n// simple but sub-optimal use\ncomponentDidMount: function() {\n  var p = extAPI.sendRequest();\n  this.addEventListener('unmount', p.abort);\n}\n\n// non-retaining/leaking version\ncomponentDidMount: function() {\n  var p = extAPI.sendRequest();\n  this.addEventListener('unmount', p.abort);\n  p.oncompleted = function() {\n    this.removeEventListener('unmount', p.abort);\n  }.bind(this);\n}\n```\n\nOr perhaps more locked-down unmount-only API:\n\n``` JS\ncomponentDidMount: function() {\n  var p = extAPI.sendRequest();\n  var dispose = this.addUnmountListener(p.abort);\n  p.oncompleted = dispose;\n}\n```\n\nOr if the API was designed with it in mind (or wrapped by a helper):\n\n``` JS\ncomponentDidMount: function() {\n  var p = extAPI.sendRequest(this);\n}\n```\n",
