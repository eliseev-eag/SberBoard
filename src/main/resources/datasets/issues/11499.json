  "body": "I have the same problem mention on this issue: [Unhandled error is displayed twice](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10384).\r\nThe error was : \r\n![cross_origin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31925861/32598947-55103198-c53b-11e7-8230-87cba756fc0f.png)\r\n\r\nBased on the @gaearon comment and [#10474](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10474)\r\n\r\n> For context, the reason it happens is because we intentionally let the browser interpret an error as uncaught before we rethrow. \r\n\r\n\r\nI understand that is thrown by the browser (source file was `searchAutocomplete.jsx`) and the second thrown by the react (source file was `react-dom.development.js`). \r\nAdded to that : \r\n\r\n> If you follow the advice in the error and add an error boundary (which you should!), you will only see the error once. So that's not a huge problem in day-to-day workflow. In fact it nudges people to add error boundaries which is nice.\r\n\r\nIn this case there is no advice mentioned by the error, How can I get the error to be thrown once ?\r\n",
