  "body": "**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\n`ReactIs.typeOf` currently only works for element types, it does not allow you to pass a raw `Component` or `ForwardRef` to know the type.\r\n\r\nThe use case for this is in `hoist-non-react-statics` I now need a [special cases for `ForwardRefs`](https://github.com/mridgway/hoist-non-react-statics/issues/48). To do this, I will need to know the type of the source and target components, but currently I would need to turn them into elements first.\r\n\r\nAll of the `ReactIs.is*` functions also have this issue since they use the `typeOf` function internally.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst ForwardComponent = React.forwardRef(() => {});\r\n\r\nReactIs.typeOf(ForwardComponent); // undefined\r\nReactIs.typeOf(React.createElement(ForwardComponent)); // Symbol(react.forward_ref)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIdeally I could pass in just the Component and get the type of it: \r\n```js\r\nReactIs.typeOf(ForwardComponent) // Symbol(react.forward_ref)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReactIs@16.3.2\r\n",
