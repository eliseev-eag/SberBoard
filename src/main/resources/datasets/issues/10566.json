  "body": "I am currently using reactJS version \"15.0.1\" in my web application. In one of the feature we need to keep pooling some information continuously after each 2 seconds. So we receive the response which is List of some object(700/1000 items in list) which we update and show in the react web application. \r\n\r\nThe Problem is after some time the application becomes unresponsive and takes too much time for any operation. On profiling I found its render, batch updates and dispatch event in react that takes the longest time. \r\n\r\nIs there any recommended way to get away with the performance issue in react. The feature needs to be refreshed every 2 seconds and list size is more than 1000 items each time.\r\n\r\nThe performance issue is observed in IE and Chrome browser.",
