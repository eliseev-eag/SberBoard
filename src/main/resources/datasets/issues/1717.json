  "body": "While porting an app to React, I ran into an issue where everything on the event is null when the event handler uses setTimeout.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/msonnabaum/Ku89S/3/\n\nI believe this is the same underlying issue as in #1360, but it feels like a bug that's worth fixing since event handlers that work with native DOM events or jQuery will break when ported to React.\n",
