  "body": "I originally posted this in the hooks thread, but this appears to be a separate issue as none of the troubleshooting steps resolve it, and I appear to only have a single copy of React... help would be greatly appreciated - I have a simple reproduction linked below.\r\n\r\nIssue:\r\n\r\nI'm having an issue using a very basic reproduction using yarn workspaces example - https://github.com/mwarger/yarn-workspace-hooks-repro\r\n\r\nI have a `component-library` that is written in typescript and bundled with parcel.  The `example-demo` is what will showcase this `component-library` and is a freshly created CRA app.  All common packages are hoisted with yarn, so in theory there should only be one version of react available.  However, the `React.useEffect` call I'm making in index.tsx causes the error that leads me to this GitHub issue.  \r\n\r\nEverything works until a hook is added.  To reproduce the error, uncomment lines 7-9 in `component-library/src/index.tsx`\r\n\r\nHopefully I'm doing something silly that I have overlooked.  Please advise as to any steps I may use to try and remedy this.  Thank you!\r\n\r\nFollow-up Edit: The below suggested debug script output prints `true` for me.  It appears that I do not have two Reacts.\r\n```\r\n// Add this in node_modules/react-dom/index.js\r\nwindow.React1 = require('react');\r\n\r\n// Add this in your component file\r\nrequire('react-dom');\r\nwindow.React2 = require('react');\r\nconsole.log(window.React1 === window.React2);\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @mwarger in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13991#issuecomment-473005931_",
