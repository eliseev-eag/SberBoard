  "body": "Have we thought about getting rid of these? https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/update.html\n\nThe API is pretty complicated, and it's probably a better idea in most cases to either use [Immutable JS](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js) (more powerful and complete), or the stage-2 proposal for [object spread syntax](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread) (simpler, will eventually be built into JS):\n\n``` js\nconst original = {a: 1, b: false, c: 'banana'};\nconst copy = {...original, b: true};   // copy is like original but with b set to true\n```\n\nAs long as we continue to have this immutability helper addon in the docs, I feel we'll be steering people new to React towards a solution that we know is a bad tradeoff.\n",
