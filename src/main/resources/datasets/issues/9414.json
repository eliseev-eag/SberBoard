  "body": "`react-addons-test-utils` was moved to `react-dom/test-utils` with the release of 15.5. This is my attempt to add a new bundle for 16 alpha in the same place. I did a quick Jest test of the generated bundle and it seemed ok but I'm still learning my way around the new build tools.\r\n\r\nI also removed some indirection in the build/bundling process for `checkPropTypes`. That's now imported directly from `prop-types/checkPropTypes` and the `src/isomorphic/classic/types/checkPropTypes.js` forwarding file has been deleted.\r\n\r\nI'm new to the bundles, but I tested my build changes using `fixtures/dom` and `fixtures/packaging` and I ran some simple Jest tests against the result of the new `test-util` target. Seemed okay. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",
