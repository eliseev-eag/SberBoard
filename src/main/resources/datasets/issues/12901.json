  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nI believe it's a bug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n`onPointerDown` isn't registering when using Chrome and Safari on mobile. When viewing it as mobile within chrome's dev tools it works fine and will log `touch` for `event.pointerType` but on mobile it's unresponsive. \r\n\r\n* [Codesandbox - logs out `pointerType`](https://codesandbox.io/s/8xr91vj4xl)\r\n* [http://vague-bird.surge.sh/](http://vague-bird.surge.sh/)\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n`this.onPointerDown` should register contact other than just `mouse` events while still covering mouse events. Below is a quick gif showing the correct behavior on the screen & in the console. \r\n\r\n*[url if below isn't running](http://g.recordit.co/pE4IM4t1xm.gif)*\r\n![onPointerDown demo](http://g.recordit.co/pE4IM4t1xm.gif)\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n* **Browsers/OS** : It's not working on iOS 11.3 for either Safari or Mobile. \r\n* **Prior Versions?**: No. Pointer Events are a new feature introduced in v16.4. \r\n\r\n\r\n[React 16.4 blog post](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/05/23/react-v-16-4.html#pointer-events)\r\n\r\n",
