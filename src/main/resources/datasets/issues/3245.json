  "body": "Here is a fiddle demonstrating the issue.\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/2913/\n\nWhen you stay on the fiddle, everything works perfectly fine. Then, leave to another browser tab for a few seconds and come back. You'll see that the animation stops completely. \n\nAfter talking with some people in the #reactjs IRC channel, we believe that the issue is something like the following:\n\nWhatever the picture that gets added while you are away does not receive the correct css classes, almost like react has no idea that it was added.\n\nAnyways, that is just a guess, but this seems incredibly problematic and I believe it is a Reactjs bug.\n",
