  "body": "to: @gaearon @aweary @iamdustan \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `toTree()` method to `ReactTestRenderer`. This method is a result of the discussions from https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/pull/742. Related discussion also in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8808.\r\n\r\nThis API will help us accomplish the goal of enzyme not needing to refer to any react internals at all.\r\n\r\nThis PR isn't complete, but I think it's a good start. I was hoping for some feedback on how to get this to the finish line.  The main things I can think of are:\r\n\r\n- [x] Need to add flow type definitions for this new code\r\n- [ ] Should we add documentation for this method?\r\n- [x] Should we try to write `toJSON()` as a function that uses `toTree()` under the hood in order to reduce amount of code?\r\n- [ ] is `toTree()` the right name?\r\n- [x] Is the code here correct? I wasn't quite sure w/ the fiber renderer if I should be using `.child` or `.progressedChild` or `.return`, etc.\r\n- [ ] For some reason when I was using Jest/Jasmine's `.toEqual` matcher, it was succeeding at times where it shouldn't, which really concerned me. I ended up changing `expect(foo).toEqual(bar)` to `expect(prettyFormat(foo)).toEqual(prettyFormat(bar)` in order to make sure things were working properly.\r\n- [ ] The way I'm nulling out `instance` on the nodes in tests is kind of wonky\r\n- [x] Should we or should we not include `children` in the `props` object of these elements? I think we should now that I think about it more, but we might have to do more hacks to make the tests easier again.\r\n",
