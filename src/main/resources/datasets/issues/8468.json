  "body": "I'm using multiple libraries which call for various versions of React and React Native.  NPM tries to find a common compatible version for everything, but these warnings persist:\r\n\r\n> npm WARN react-addons-shallow-compare@15.3.2 requires a peer of react@^15.3.2 but none was installed.\r\n> npm WARN react-test-renderer@15.4.1 requires a peer of react@^15.4.1 but none was installed.\r\n\r\nIs it necessary to tightly couple the versions?  It would be beneficial to loosen the dependencies and let the consumer of the library choose which version to use.\r\n",
