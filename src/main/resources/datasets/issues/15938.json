  "body": "This PR addresses a keyboard bug that was a recent regression found in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/15930. The problem was that there was a false assumption made that `click` occurred after `keyup`, it's actually the other way around. I've also updated the unit test that tracks this logic and ensured it matched the browser behaviour correctly. @aweary This should work for you now, let me know if you have any other issues!",
