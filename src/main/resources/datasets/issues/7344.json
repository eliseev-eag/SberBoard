  "body": "**`workInProgress`** (yay puns)\n\nImplements `setState` for Fiber. Updates are scheduled by setting a work priority on the fiber and bubbling it to the root. Because the instance does not know which tree is current at any given time, the update is scheduled on both fiber alternates.\n\nNeed to add more unit tests to cover edge cases.\n\nA few questions I have:\n- How to deal with the circular dependency between ReactFiberScheduler and ReactFiberBeginWork. I'm using a closure to lazily access the scheduler but seems like there may be a better way.\n- How to queue update callbacks. The only way I could think to do it was to add another field to Fiber, so I've punted on this for now.\n- How to access the fiber from the updater. I decided to use a private field on the instance. Could also create a new updater for each instance and close over its fiber, but that seems wasteful.\n- Should I put `setState` related tests in their own module? I think I should but not sure.\n\n(I discussed with @sebmarkbage before working on this PR.)\n\nBased on https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7448.
