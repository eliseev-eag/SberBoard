  "body": "Someone interested in trying a \"fix\" on this? Meaning you would still have a reference(key, ish) to state through a render pass, but it will be destructed and you would only have the reference left on destruction. On re-render, the state rebuilds the previous one, kinda like hot reloading, but it watches how the previous state rendered and tries to re-render out of that, and then builds the changes made in the new render. Dunno how this will be in-action though.\n\n**Is this something worth chasing?**\n",
