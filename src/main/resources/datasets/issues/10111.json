  "body": "This is either a bug in documentation or in implementation.\r\n\r\nAccording to [setState doc](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html#setstate) when there is a need to refer to previous state, one must use the updater function. Problem is that when this updater function is used to change state from `componentWillReceiveProps`, state is not updated before `render` function is called. In result `render` gets new props but old state and is not called again after state is really updated.\r\n\r\nThis illustrates the problem:\r\n[https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/115/](https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/115/)\r\n\r\nI observed this problem in react 15.2.0 and 15.6.1.\r\n",
