  "body": "When upgrading to react 0.14 there comes a warning among others that says that addons should not be requires through `react/addons', they should instead be required from their own package. First, I would like to point out that I think it is a very good change to put the addons in their separate packages. However I have also noticed that the addons are in fact _not really_ put in their separate packages but they just link to the implementation still existing within the react package. \n\nThis brings some trouble to our build. If we browserify an addon (currently only using transition group) that bundle will include all of react. This causes an error when running our app. An alternative for us is to import `react/addons`. This gets rid of the error but leaves us with red warnings. I do consider this a non option as I think it is important to leave the number of warnings/errors to 0. \n\nAs mentioned I do think it is a step in the right direction to extract the addons but I also think it is wrong to require the user to update the import before the change is actually made. Could this be reconsidered?\n",
