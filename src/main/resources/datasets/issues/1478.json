  "body": "As the docs state, ReactCSSTransitionGroup keeps DOM elements on the page until an animation completes, thus necessitating a leave transition. If you want an enter animation but no leave animation, you can specify `transitionLeave={false}`. However, DOM elements still seem to stick around and occasionally throw the transitionend warning even when using `transitionLeave={false}`. (`transition(): tried to perform an animation without an animationend or transitionend event after timeout (5000ms). You should either disable this transition in JS or add a CSS animation/transition.`)\n\n**Repro Case**\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/kb3gN/2145/\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**\n- Click `Add All` to add three components to the page.\n- Click `Remove All` to remove the added components.\n  - Notice how some elements are staying on the page instead of removing all as expected\n- Remove `transitionLeave={false}` from the JSX so the supplied leave transition runs\n  - Removal works as expected (but with an undesired leave animation)\n\nThis occurs with both CSS transitions and with keyframe animations (change the `transitionName` from `transition-example` to `key-frame-example`).\n\n**Workaround**\nRemove `transitionLeave={false}` and use a 0sec leave transition.\n_Disclaimer:_ this workaround doesn't seem bullet proof. At least in my more complex view that I'm creating, doing a handful (5-10) of additions/removals (and perhaps doing it fairly rapidly) will produce the transitionend warning, leaving elements in the UI.\n",
