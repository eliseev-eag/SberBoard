I create an app using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)\r\n2. I use JAWS Professional Edition Version 2018 (build 1710.42 ILM) and Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7\r\n3. I use arrow keys to navigate to paragraph \"Edit src/App.js and save to reload.\"\r\n4. Jaws announces \"Edit src/App.js and save to reload. **clickable**\"\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThis paragraph is non interactive, it should not be announced as clickable.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n- JAWS Professional Edition Version 2018 (build 1710.42 ILM) \r\n- Internet Explorer 11\r\n- Windows 7\r\n- create-react-app 2.0.3\r\n\r\n**suspected cause**\r\nUsing Chrome Event Listener Breakpoints I observed there's a function called `trapClickOnNonInteractiveElement` which is the onclick handler for non interactive elements. This noop function is causing JAWS to think this is an interactive element\r\n\r\n**possible solution**\r\nIn [trapClickOnNonInteractiveElement](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/8a8d973d3cc5623676a84f87af66ef9259c3937c/packages/react-dom/src/client/ReactDOMComponent.js#L245) there is a comment which reads \r\n```\r\n// TODO: Only do this for the relevant Safaris maybe?\r\n```\r\nI think that this would fix this issue.",
