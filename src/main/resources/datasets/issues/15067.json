  "body": "Failing test for https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/15057.\r\nPossibly relates to some cases of https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14369.\r\n\r\nThe crux of the issue is that **even if we use a guard variable, sometimes an effect can't `setState` without triggering a warning**. In particular, this happens if:\r\n\r\n* We set state in a component (e.g. from an event emitter call)\r\n* We flush previous effect before we the state gets set\r\n* Flushing previous effect caused a state change in a parent which resulted in component unmounting\r\n* The scheduler thinks we *called* `setState` on an unmounted component, and warns\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to fix it. I imagine I'd expect that if `flushPassiveEffects` [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/d0289c7e3a2dfc349dcce7f9eb3dee22464e97bd/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js#L1109) led to unmounting of that component, we ideally shouldn't warn [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/d0289c7e3a2dfc349dcce7f9eb3dee22464e97bd/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberScheduler.js#L1860).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if there are any bigger issues in cases where it's *not* unmounted though. Is this just a stray warning or is there a larger potential concern?",
