  "body": "This is a tracking issue, because we're not ready to deprecate the return value of `ReactDOM.render()` yet.  This will likely be a longer-term objective (not immediate), but we should have an issue to reference as we start to get the ball rolling.\n\nReasoning: We are working towards a new incremental reconciler, which means that a render may not be complete prior to `ReactDOM.render()` returning.  For anyone relying on the return value of `ReactDOM.render()`, there would be a race condition where the returned instance is potentially not fully mounted.  Safe-looking code might work 99% of the time, but fail 1% of the time, at the sole discretion of the scheduler.  To be clear: this is not an issue today, but will become an issue once we start utilizing an incremental renderer, iff people rely on the return value.\n\nAs we prepare for the new reconciliation algorithm, we should start encouraging people should start avoiding the return value of `ReactDOM.render`.  People should, instead, attach a callback ref to their root component when rendering the component, thus allowing them to get a reference to the instance after mounting is complete.\n\nFirst step in this process is to update the documentation to state that the return value of `ReactDOM.render` is legacy, and that people should attach a ref instead (similar to what we did for string refs).\n",
