  "body": "If you have a line of code like the following:\n\n```\nnew SomeReactComponent({content: this.props.foo.get('bar')})\n```\n\nand `this.props.foo` doesn't exist, the React code makes it difficult to debug what's going on.\n\nNormally you can ask the Chrome debugger (and other debuggers as well) to pause on an exception, and it will halt the debugger right on that line.  You can then mouseover `this.props.foo` and see that it is `undefined`.\n\nHowever, React has this code:\n\n```\ntry {\n    renderedComponent = this._renderValidatedComponentWithoutOwnerOrContext();\n} finally {\n    ReactContext.current = previousContext;\n    ReactCurrentOwner.current = null;\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, any errors that happen during `_renderValidatedComponentWithoutOwnerOrContext` are swallowed up, losing both the useful stacktrace and the ability for the browser to debug that code.\n\nI understand React needs to do the two lines in the finally to clean up, but it would be helpful if it could save the exception thrown (eg. `try{...} catch (e) { var caughtError = e}`) and then rethrow it after it has finished the cleanup (eg. `throw (caughtError);`).\n\nIf for some reason that's impossible, an alternative (but less useful) solution would be to log the error (`console && console.error(caughtError)`).  This would at least provide the developer with the stacktrace, although it wouldn't let them debug the error.\n",
