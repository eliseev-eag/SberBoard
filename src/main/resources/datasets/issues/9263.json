Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nnot it did not\r\n\r\nI don't know anyone who would be using the current behaviour for their benefit. This is such a trivial thing to add, yet it provides a great value for every react developer I know. \r\nI understand react tries to be as light as possible, but I can't help but wonder-is it worth the extra trouble by deferring such a trivial thing to the react ecosystem?\r\nNo, it's not worth the extra http request, it's not worth an extra npm dependency. The whole function is like 20 lines long!\r\n\r\nIs there a consensus in the react community that this is the best way to transform objects into classnames? \r\nYes- on NPM react was downloaded 3.3 million times last month and classnames 2 million times. Seems like comfortable majority uses classnames library already.\r\n\r\nSo maybe let's add it to the core? Pretty please?\r\n",
