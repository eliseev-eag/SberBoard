  "body": "The common way to send additional properties to onClick handlers is with `.bind`:\n\n``` jsx\n<div>\n{this.props.items.map(x => <div className=\"item\" onClick={this.handleClick.bind(null, x.val)}>{x}</div>}\n</div>\n```\n\n[ESLint](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-no-bind.md) Suggests that constant .bind calls in render are no good for performance, and recommends to pass data from the child's onClick handler back to the parent handler:\n\n``` jsx\nvar List = React.createClass({\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <ul>\n        {this.props.items.map(item =>\n          <ListItem key={item.id} item={item} onItemClick={this.props.onItemClick} />\n        )}\n      </ul>\n    );\n  }\n});\n\nvar ListItem = React.createClass({\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <li onClick={this._onClick}>\n        ...\n      </li>\n    );\n  },\n  _onClick() {\n    this.props.onItemClick(this.props.item.id);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nHowever, i feel this is a bit detrimental to readability (not to mention, a bit of a pain to write for something as simple as partial functions, which get used everywhere seemingly), because i (as another programmer) now need to go to the child definition (which could very well be in another file) to find out what exactly my child is passing me in my parameter list. Not to mention how complex an onClick handler may become by another developer coming in and modifying the code to handle their own event properly as well. (god help them if they have to propagate & modify their params through multiple layers)\n\nExample:\n\n``` jsx\nfunction Foo({text}) {\n    return (<li>{text}</li>)\n}\n\nclass Bar extends React.component {\n    handleClick(e) {\n        console.log(e.component.props.text)\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div>\n               <Foo text={\"baz!\"} onClick={this.handleClick}/>\n           </div>\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe idea here is to attach the component the event originated from to the synthetic event. Would something like this be possible/feasible/even needed (Does bind really bring that much of an impact)? Is there another, better way to do this without `.bind`?\n",
