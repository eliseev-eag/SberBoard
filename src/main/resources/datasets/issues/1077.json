  "body": "Was talking with Adam Wolff today about rxjs and there are a ton of common bugs with these functions. You're gonna have a bad time if you use these in React `render()` methods too -- if we monkeypatched these to warn in `__DEV__` we could prevent some bugs. @jordwalke seemed to like the idea too.\n",
