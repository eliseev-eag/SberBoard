  "body": "<!--\r\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\r\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n`useMemo` does not update when the length of the array argument changes. Other hooks with the array parameter behave the same way.\r\n\r\nIn the fiddle below, the second render doesn’t trigger a recalculation of the `string` variable even though the second argument to `useMemo` has changed.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/steadicat/659psofc/2/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen the second argument to `useMemo` changes length, `useMemo` should recompute.\r\n\r\nThe current behavior might be by design, as this is a slightly unusual use of the array parameter. If that’s the case case I would argue that this is an easy pitfall that should be fixed or at least documented. Nowhere in the docs does it say that the length of the array parameter should be constant. If you have an input array of varying length, one could assume that it’s fine to splice into that parameter in and everything should just work. There are potential good reasons for not using the data array as one of the elements instead of splicing (e.g. if the array gets mutated, or if it is dynamically generated based on potentially mutated data).\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16.7.0-alpha.0",
