  "body": "Hello,\n\nI'm trying to sort list of elements (each with unique key) in aplication based on React and Redux.\nFor sorting I'm using: https://github.com/RubaXa/Sortable and it works really good until I save my sort order to redux store. \nAfter my store changes it triggers re-rendering elements, which swap them back to previous positions, probalbly because React can'd detect that Sortable already made that change in DOM.\n\nIt all works well when I use Math.random for keys but I'd really like to avoid that.\n\nCan I force React to detect that keys in displayed list already changed it's order?\n",
