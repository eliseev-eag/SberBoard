  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen using `lazy` from `react` HMR on one component change takes longer than without.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm using standard case:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst Home = lazy(() => import('./routes/Home'));\r\n\r\nconst App = () => (\r\n  <Router>\r\n    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\r\n      <Switch>\r\n        <Route exact path=\"/\" component={Home}/>\r\n        <Route path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\r\n      </Switch>\r\n    </Suspense>\r\n  </Router>\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nTo take the same time. I have many routes. With `lazy` it takes about 30 seconds when changing one component - no matter which. Without lazy about 3 seconds.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nVersion 16.6.1, no matter what kind of a browser and environment.\r\n",
