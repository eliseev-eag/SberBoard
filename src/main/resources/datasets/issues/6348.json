  "body": "# This \"good first bug\" is taken by @YongPilMoon. Don't work on it unless that's you!\r\n\r\nThis has been discussed a few times before but I don’t think there was any conclusion, and PRs intending to solve the issue were not merged for various reasons.\r\n\r\nI would like to close those PRs as outdated, and reboot the discussion about this.\r\nPerformance considered, the conclusion from @sebmarkbage and @syranide seems to be:\r\n\r\n> We should consider not allowing conflicting style rules at all.\r\n\r\n— https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/2013#issuecomment-57338177\r\n\r\n> IMHO, all things considered it's better to just disallow overlapping and warn in dev.\r\n\r\n— https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/4661#issuecomment-132996649\r\n\r\nRadium by @ianobermiller came to the same conclusion in https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium/issues/95 but there was some backlash afterwards. React Native seems to allow style expansions but only for a few attributes (e.g. `margin` and `padding`, but not `border`).\r\n\r\nI’m closing old pull requests about this, and creating this issue to track implementation of the behavior we seem to agree upon: we should warn in `__DEV__` when `border` and `borderBottom` are used at the same time. We can discuss more specifics (should either be ignored? should we allow a few whitelisted properties but warn for others?) in this issue.\r\n\r\nAs a migration strategy, we can suggest people to use something like https://github.com/ActionIQ/style-builder if they really need those shortcuts. It’s also something we’ll need to decide upon when implementing integrated styling.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\n- #2231\r\n- #2407\r\n- #5030\r\n- https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium/issues/95\r\n\r\nRelated PRs:\r\n- #2013\r\n- #4661\r\n",
