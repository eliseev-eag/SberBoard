  "body": "We used to copy it right from the source, but I broke it in \"Drop Haste\" PR because now the imports in the source don't resolve in www.\r\n\r\nIt was a very weird strategy anyway. Instead, I'm changing it to just hang off our www build. It's not ideal that now we ship it on the desktop too, but it's pretty tiny and seems like it's not a big deal.\r\n\r\nIn the next sync, we'd need to delete the shims I deleted here. I'm preparing an internal diff that will remove remaining imports of `SyntheticUIEvent` internally so we can cleanly get rid of it.",
