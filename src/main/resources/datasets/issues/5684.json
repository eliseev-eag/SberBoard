  "body": "I had a pesky bug that was hard to track down where React was defining the `style` key twice on an element.  I finally discovered that it was because I had defined an element like this:\n\n```\n<form style=\"margin-top\" style={{marginTop: 25}}>\n```\n\nClearly a mistake/typo on my part, but in my production code it caused a duplicate `style` entry in the object, which breaks IE 11 and Safari 8.  It would have been nice to see an invariant warning about this or something.\n\nIt may be because I'm using `optimisation.react.constantElements`.. not sure\n",
