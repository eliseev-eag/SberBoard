  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nI accidently generated my SSR output using `renderToStaticMarkup` instead of `renderToString`, which I then hydrated using `hydrate`. This  led to a warning, caused by collapsed text nodes. `renderToString` would have added HTML comments between them.\r\n\r\nThe warning I got was: \r\nWarning: Text content did not match. Server: \"a (b)\" Client: \"a\"\r\n\r\nWhen rendering:\r\n```jsx\r\n    const a = 'a';\r\n    const b = 'b';\r\n    const component = <select><option>{a} ({b})</option></select>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if `hydrate`  could detect that it is executed on output from `renderToStaticMarkup` instead of `renderToString`. It seems to me a simple check on the `data-reactroot` attribute on the root element would suffice.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would like some kind of warning along the following lines:\r\n\r\n`Warning: You are hydrating output that was not created by ReactDOMServer.renderToString(). Perhaps you are using ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup() or modifying the output after rendering. Please see ... for more information.`\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.1.1.\r\n\r\nDue to the changes in 16, this worked before.",
