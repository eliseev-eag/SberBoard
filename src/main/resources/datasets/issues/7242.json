  "body": "_Hopefully_ this helps reduce some confusion about what each build actually is and maybe we'll see fewer people doing benchmarks with the dev version.\n\nThere's some more to do to make sure this is actually right and works, but this is the general idea. We'd build `react.dev.js` and `react.prod.js` and the minified version of each. We should do all the other ones as well (addons less important long term, but react-dom definitely needs this treatment because #7164).\n\nWe start recommending these file names as soon as they are part of a release. We keep building the plain `react.js` & `react.min.js` for compatibility. For v16 we stop building them entirely.\n\nTODO:\n- [ ] Remove the minified dev-mode warning. It won't make any sense. We might still want it for npm though\n- [ ] Make sure prod build isn't already minified. It mostly is because of the `uglifify` step. We might not need those anymore anyway if we do this after rolloup (that step is only there to remove some `require`s but rollup handles that I think).\n- [ ] docs updates\n- [ ] Do 2 builds instead of 5 (should be able to just run uglify over the non-min code, can even have a `.map` then, and then copy the right files instead of doing a duplicate build).\n",
