  "body": "React@15.4.0 (on 15.3.2 all is well)\r\nThis invariant \"Unable to find element with ID 'undefined'\" error happens when specific (yet not special in any kind) component update is triggered from `callback` in `ReactDOM.render(<element>, <domElement>, <callback>)`. Using MobX for state management. and latest 2nd Webpack.\r\nThis I guess doesn't qualify as proper issue report, as I could localize issue to specific component, which when removed solves this. And there is completely nothing special about this component. All is working in 15.3.2.\r\n\r\nSidenote, app is rendered on server successfully and when crash happens on client then... when I move cursor over that particular component after this crash - error is being constantly console.log'ed. But when I move cursor outside, nothing gets logged. And I'm not attaching any listeners for cursor movements.",
