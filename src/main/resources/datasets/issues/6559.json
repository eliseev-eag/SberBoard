  "body": "As per the discussion today...\n\nSometimes you are developing on a platform that doesn't have devtools (safari, etc).  The problem is that you are looking at a whole pile of markup, and can't tell which components rendered it.  Without devtools, the output markup is really hard to navigate.  It would be cool if we had comment nodes (or a `data-reactcomponent` attribute) that helps users navigate the output.\n\nThese nodes would be rendered only in dev mode or with some flag turned on or something.\n",
