  "body": "The documentation on `React.initializeTouchEvents(true)` could use a little love:\nhttp://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html#touch-events\n\nI realize it's currently changing and may be removed (#436, #1170). Is it still required? Is it only required if we use react-tap-event-plugin?\n\nWhat's most confusing about it is when to use it. Use it if the page being rendered will ever render on a touch device? Or do we detect touch using something like `Modernir.touch` and then set it to true?\n\nRelated to this issue is the tap delay. Maybe suggest in the documentation using a plugin like tap-event-plugin? \n\nI would submit a PR but really don't know what the documentation should say. Thanks!\n",
