Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction useSomething(search: string) {\r\n  const request = useAxios({ url });\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    if (search.length >= 3) {\r\n      request.execute();\r\n    }\r\n  }, [request.execute, search]); // missing dependency `request` is shown\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    if (request.response) {\r\n      console.log('success');\r\n    }\r\n  }, [request.response]);\r\n\r\n  return { request };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n`request.execute` should be fine as a dependency, just like `request.response`. However I get a warning that I should use `request` as a dependency which is wrong (it changes more often than `request.execute` and I just use `request.execute` in my effect).\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n`eslint-plugin-react-hooks@2.0.1`",
