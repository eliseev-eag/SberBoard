  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen a component returns something other than a valid React element, or `null`, it throws and does so infinitely. This is render-blocking and freezes the window.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\r\nThis happened to me when creating a Provider-type component that rendered its children directly. More specifically, when they were `undefined`. Eg\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass Provider extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return this.props.children // should throw once.\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Elsewhere\r\n<div>\r\n  <Provider>this works correctly</Provider>\r\n\r\n  // This freaks out\r\n  <Provider />\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1375\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-03-16 at 15 29 54\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1608329/24016088/b7dbcac2-0a82-11e7-9493-a9e5d3877e40.png\">\r\n\r\nIs there a [CodePen, Fiddle, etc] of `@next` somewhere, that I can use to demonstrate this?\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt should throw, but only once and not freeze the browser.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16.0.0-alpha.4\r\nYes, see http://codepen.io/rthor/pen/bqYBap?editors=0010#0\r\n\r\n---\r\nPS I know it's an alpha version ðŸ˜„ ",
