  "body": "Getting this error in IE. Moreover, the react application works fine in IE when used as standalone webpack dev server but the built js file using webpack and babel fails to navigate when used inside of a jsp file inside our application.\r\n\r\nThe build application works fine in mozilla and chrome. I have read other replies for this topic which talks about the promise raising an unhandled exception. But that is not the case with the application coz the home page doesn't have any promise calls. Understand that this has to do with component error or syntax error but since the application is working fine in mozilla and chrome not able to find out the exact issue. We built our react application with testing it all along in chrome and only recently started testing it on IE.\r\n\r\nUsing below versions of libraries\r\nreact\": \"^15.4.0\",\r\n\"react-redux\": \"^5.0.1\",\r\n\"react-router\": \"^3.0.0\",\r\n\"react-router-redux\": \"^4.0.7\",\r\n    \"webpack\": \"^1.14.0\",\r\n    \"webpack-dev-server\": \"^1.16.2\",\r\n    \"babel-core\": \"^6.20.0\",\r\n    \"babel-loader\": \"^6.2.9\",\r\n    \"babel-runtime\": \"^6.20.0\",\r\n    \"babel-polyfill\": \"^6.20.0\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
