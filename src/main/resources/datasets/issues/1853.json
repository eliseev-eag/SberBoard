  "body": "I believe I have a repro of this bug here: http://jsfiddle.net/joshma/t68Nv/5/\n\nI ran into it when my child component called a passed-in handler to clean up during its `componentWillUnmount`, triggered while the parent was unmounting as well. This handler, belonging to the parent, tries to pause the parent's audio node, but `this.refs.audioNode` was already empty. (For what it's worth, when I inserted a breakpoint the DOM node is still there.)\n\nI mentioned this on IRC and @zpao suggested it might be a bug, so here I am. :)\n",
