  "body": "Adjusted the regex used when auto-generating links to docs headers.\n\nAn example of the issue being fixed can be seen in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7235#discussion_r70165133. If this PR is merged, I can update my Russian PRs with proper hrefs. For existing docs I've gone through and made sure all the links are working in all of the available languages. (some of them had to manually create `<a name=X>` anchors to be referenced, I removed those and replaced the corresponding references with new auto-generated links)\n\nWhat I haven't been able to fix in this fix ðŸ˜„ is that when links are generated with Markdown's link syntax `[text](link)`, they have their hrefs URL-encoded, so\n`[ReactElement / ReactElement íŒ©í† ë¦¬](#react-ì—˜ë¦¬ë¨¼íŠ¸)`\nwill have a href of\n`#react-%EC%97%98%EB%A6%AC%EB%A8%BC%ED%8A%B8`\n\nI argue that this drawback doesn't defeat the purpose of this PR though as this is only applicable for our internal links. (which, prior to the fix, looked something like `#---..--` anyway as seen in the PR above) The \"#\" sign near headers themselves will still have a proper unicode href which can be copy-pasted and shared nicely.\n\nAlso went ahead and fixed some of the broken links already present in some of the translations.\n",
