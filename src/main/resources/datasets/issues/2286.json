  "body": "Just an idea.\n\nI was looking at the React/JSX examples and I noticed something.  The only place that JSX shows up is in the \"render\" function (or trivially in renderComponent).  This function ends up looking a lot like a regular HTML template, but with the strange limitation that [you have to handle looping yourself](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html#hook-up-the-data-model) since there's no template syntax for that.\n\nThis got me thinking.  You could probably write your templates in any old templating language and then programmatically convert that to React elements.  You could write templates resembling jquery, angular, django, jinja2, even haml, and with a custom parser/converter build React templates.  And you could do this without any JSX involved.  And it would probably look better.\n\nI wonder if the main appeal of JSX is to overcome the lack of multi-line string syntax in JavaScript?  At first I was thinking, \"easy; just put your templates in a HEREDOC sting and parse them out\", but then I use CoffeeScript where that exists.  Some alternative ways to organize things:\n\nIn Angular, you can reference your templates by URL in dev, and then preload them into the page in production to save on requests.  It's a lot like using RequireJS in production.\n\nIn Polymer, each widget gets its own HTML file including a `<template>` element and a `<script>` element, so the template and behavior can be side by side.  This could be done in React too.  Substitute `<script type=\"text/template\">` for the `<template>` element if it's not available.  You then combine all of these HTML files, dynamically in dev or statically in production using vulcanize.\n\nThe Polymer way seems pretty tempting to me.  Honestly I'd be using Polymer instead if it had IE8 support :P.\n\nOr they could add looping to JSX and it'd probably look about as good.  We're already preprocessing the script, so anything is possible here.\n",
