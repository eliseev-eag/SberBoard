  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nbug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI'm working with `react-apollo` right now and there was a mistake in my code which could re-render the inner query at the same time with the outer query (this was an integration test). I can see this React error in the console (which perfectly makes sense), but the problem is that I expect it to be caught by top-level boundary component with componentDidCatch() but it didn't get executed in this case. As a result, `jest` hangs up and bitbucket pipelines stop the build for the PR after 2 hours of inactivity.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI guess componentDidCatch() could've caught this exception.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nWe're using React@16.4.1",
