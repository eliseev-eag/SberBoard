  "body": "Hi!\n\n@spicyj said I should open an issue here. Disclaimer: I'm trying to do sort of sketchy things, and I know this isn't supported, but I think it would be nice.\n\nI'm writing a library that I want to support react output optionally. To do this, right now I'm trying to inline all my ReactElements, such as\n\n``` javascript\n    return {\n        type: 'hr',\n        key: state.key,\n        _isReactElement: true\n    };\n```\n\ninstead of\n\n``` javascript\n    React.createElement('hr', {\n        key: state.key\n    })\n```\n\nThis is almost completely functional, except for the `_store` validation in react dev mode. This is because right now these literals don't have a `_store` key with `.validated` or `.originalProps`, which are assumed by the validators in React **DEV**. I can work around this, but to do so without duplicating props will have to write a wrapper function to create the element, which is a little unideal and slower (and adds unnecessary keys in non-dev mode).\n\nWould it be reasonable to short circuit some of these checks so that they only happen if _store is actually present on the ReactElement? If so, I'd be happy to submit a pull request (no rush for react 0.13 though).\n\nCurious as to your thoughts. Thanks!\nAria\n",
