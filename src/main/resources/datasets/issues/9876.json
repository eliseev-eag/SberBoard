  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nThis is more of a documentation discussion\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nCurrently, the contributing guide lists the lint step before running prettier. For example, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` says:\r\n```\r\n5. Make sure your code lints (`npm run lint`).\r\n6. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`npm run prettier`).\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI think it would make more sense to run prettier first, since it can automatically get rid of certain lint errors (like single-quotes or comma-dangle). A first-time contributor following the steps in order might waste time fixing things manually at the lint step before proceeding to the formatting step.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nN/A",
