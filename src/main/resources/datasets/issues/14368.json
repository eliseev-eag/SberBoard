  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nFeature\r\n\r\nI think it would be useful to have the ability to set the containing element tag of a component using some syntactic flag (not a prop) because the tag isn't really the data of a component, which is what a prop is for.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nCurrently there are two options I'm aware of setting the containing tag element\r\n\r\n### Option 1\r\nSet the tag as a prop when calling the component.\r\n\r\n```.jsx\r\nconst MyButtonComponent = props => {\r\n    const Tag = props.tag ? props.tag : 'button';\r\n    \r\n    return <Tag>{ props.children }</Tag>\r\n}\r\n\r\n<MyButtonComponent tag=\"button\">I'm a button</MyButtonComponent>\r\n<MyButtonComponent tag=\"a\">I'm an anchor link</MyButtonComponent>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Option 2\r\nRender a `<Fragment>` at the root of the child and render the container element from the parent.\r\n\r\n```.jsx\r\nconst MyButtonComponent = props => {\r\n    return <React.Fragment>{ props.children }</React.Fragment>\r\n}\r\n\r\n<button><MyButtonComponent>I'm a button</MyButtonComponent></button>\r\n<a><MyButtonComponent>I'm an anchor link</MyButtonComponent></a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor both options, the result would be:\r\n\r\n```.html\r\n<button>I'm a button</button>\r\n<a>I'm an anchor link</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth work, but I feel like if we can infer the props.children from whatever is inbetween the component tags, why not provide some more syntactic sugar for setting the tag element as well?\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI think something like `<Component::tag>Content</Component::tag>` might be nice.\r\n\r\nSo the previous examples would instead be written as follows:\r\n\r\n```.jsx\r\n<MyButtonComponent::button>I'm a button</MyButtonComponent::button>\r\n<MyButtonComponent::a>I'm an anchor link</MyButtonComponent::a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI feel this syntax adequately describes what's happening, but is terse enough that you don't end up having to create additional nodes or pass props to components. I believe props should be reserved for the **data** of the component. Using them to set the tag seems hacky to me.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nN/A",
