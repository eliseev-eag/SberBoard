One of them is completely new, another one is the old one that used to loop forever but now just fails.\r\n\r\n#### Fix portal unmounting https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8532/commits/3ba8069fefed06dae0e3be74b9c42734752e1580\r\n\r\nWhen we unmount a portal, we need to unmount *its* children from itself.\r\nThis is similar to what we would do for a root if we allowed deleting roots.\r\n\r\nThis fixes an error unmouting a portal.\r\n\r\n#### Skip portals when looking for host siblings 4596fc48ba371237ef83868d411fe684e1c877df\r\n\r\nA portal is not part of that host tree despite being a child.\r\n\r\nThis fixes an error inserting a portal sibling.\r\n\r\n#### Add a failing test for portal child reconciliation 3f2129aeee8ba11ca803f68395a6978a8c8cf3b3\r\n\r\nIt is failing because portal bails out of update, seeing `null` in `pendingProps`.\r\nIt is `null` because we set `pendingProps` to `nextPortal.children`, which is `null` in this test.\r\n\r\n#### Fix the bug when switching to a null portal child ed9747deedf11455ba3eb65648007ab99c26ea58\r\n\r\nIf `pendingProps` is `null`, we do a bailout in `beginWork`.\r\nThis prevents unmounting of the existing child when the new child is `null`.\r\n\r\nWe fix this by changing portal fiber's `pendingProps` to be the portal object itself instead of its children. This way, it is never `null`, and thus doesn't cause a false positive in the bailout condition.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSee more commits below after discussion.",
