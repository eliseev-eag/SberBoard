  "body": "Currently, there's no support for \"conditional Hook\", i mean we couldn't enable/disable Hook based on  a javascript value.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: Allow for all Hooks to have an optional `enable` paramenter , which default value set to `true`.\r\nSo if a user set `enable: false` , like \r\n```js\r\nconst shouldRunState = false\r\nconst [count, setCount] = useState({enable: shouldRunState})\r\n```\r\nthe Hooks will simply have no effect at all, as if it's not there.\r\n\r\nMy example is just to show what the feature look like.\r\nThis feature should be backward compatible with current Hooks API.\r\n\r\nCommon use case is allow a Component/Parent to control Hooks based on `props/context`, so it'll make Hooks more flexible to use.\r\n",
