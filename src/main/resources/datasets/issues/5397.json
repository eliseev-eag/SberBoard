  "body": "Based on the discussion in: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5030#issuecomment-153803552\n\nCurrently, we diff css properties and imperatively set individual properties for each value that differs from the previous render.  We've long claimed that \"performance\" was the reason, but the benchmarks don't seem to support this claim.  For instance, consider Ben's perf test (http://jsperf.com/style-vs-csstext-vs-setattribute/8 (from https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/929).  Realistically, there are cases where one technique is faster than the other, and vice versa.  It's probably a wash.\n\nBut using `cssText` has several advantages over our current approach.  Most notably, it solves correctness issues related to the various css shorthand properties (as noted in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5030).  It also cleanly solves vendor prefixing, and a variety of other edge cases.  Plus, as an added bonus, it means that the React core is doing less work and is therefore simpler/cleaner/moreMaintainable.\n",
