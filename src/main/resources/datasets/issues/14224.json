  "body": "When updating `react` and `react-dom` from 16.6.0 to 16.6.1 or 16.6.2, I get new warnings that did not occur prior:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning: Expected instance props to match memoized props before componentDidMount. This is likely due to a bug in React. Please file an issue.\r\nWarning: Expected instance props to match memoized props before componentDidUpdate. This is likely due to a bug in React. Please file an issue.\r\nWarning: Expected instance props to match memoized props before processing the update queue. This is likely due to a bug in React. Please file an issue.\r\n```\r\nall from `react-dom.development.js?ec6d:506`\r\n\r\nI am unable to give you examples from the code as I am not sure where this is occurring and the stacktrace comes from deep in `react-dom` and is unfollowable from my code, though it happens on every page visited within the app. Reverting back to 16.6.0 versions removes the warning completely. \r\n\r\nThere exists at least one other with the same problem: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53272887/expected-instance-props-to-match-memoized-props-in-react-16\r\n",
