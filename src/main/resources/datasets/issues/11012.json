  "body": "The new docs site looks great! I did an audit of the links on the entire site and found some issues. This PR attempts to address them:\r\n\r\n- The `<ExternalFooterLink>` component was not making use of the `rel` prop passed in. Hence links created by `<ExternalFooterLink>` component could have `target=\"_blank\"` and subjected to the `window.opener` security vulnerabililty. I have made `<ExternalFooterLink>` use the `rel` prop.\r\n- Some links with `target=\"_blank\"` don't have the `rel=\"noopener\"` attribute.\r\n- Reorder the `sectionListCommunity` links on the [Community Resources page](https://reactjs.org/community/support.html) to match the footer.\r\n- Some of the links that have the external icon / render the `<ExternalLinkSvg>` component do not open in new tabs. I made the behavior consistent by adding `target=\"_blank\"` and `rel=\"noopener\"` to them. If this is intended, let me know and I'll revert.\r\n\r\nOther minor stuff:\r\n\r\n- `**remarkable**` on the homepage of the \"A Component Using External Plugins\" section was left as markdown. Changed it to `<strong>` as the line \"JSX is optional and not required to use in the React\" in the \"A Simple Component\" section is also rendered using `<strong>`.\r\n\r\nSome questions/suggestions I have:\r\n\r\n- Some of the links in the templates of the `docs` directory face the issues mentioned above but they are no longer in use. Should they be fixed as well?\r\n- I think `target=\"_blank\"` and `rel=\"noopener\"` should be part of an `<ExternalLink>` component so that all external links on the new docs site can use it without having those two props be repeated so many times like inside `LayoutFooter/Footer.js`. I can do a site-wide refactor for this if there's interest.",
