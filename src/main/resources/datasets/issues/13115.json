  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nAs you can see in the example below, onMouseLeave of parent element get triggered every time, when you hover the svg which is get element to render by `<use>` in IE11 (and probably lower).  \r\nIt works as expected in other browsers and with regular `<path>` inside svg. And also, the native event work as expected too (as you can see in expample), so I identify the bug as React's.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/jnn8w7940w\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nTo not trigger onMouseLeave when mouse doesn't leave the parent element.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nTested on React 16.3.2 and 16.4.1.",
