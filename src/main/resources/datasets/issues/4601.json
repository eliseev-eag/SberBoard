  "body": "[Docs about `setState`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-api.html) say:\n\n> Merges nextState with the current state. This is the primary method you use to trigger UI updates from event handlers and server request callbacks.\n\nFrom what I experienced, the state is not really merged. What happens is that properties from `nextState` are assigned to `this.state`. This is not a real merge.\n\nIn short, `setState` behaves like lodash's [`_.assign`](https://lodash.com/docs#assign) and not like [`_.merge`](https://lodash.com/docs#merge). Or, to put it in other words, it is not a recursive merge, but a shallow one.\n\nI suppose you should either fix this in the code (but this could break backwards compatibility), or **update the documentation to be clear about this**. \n",
