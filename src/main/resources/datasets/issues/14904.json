This was an old issue that seems to have resurfaced.\r\n\r\n[this code pen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/VmmPgp?editors=0010) used in the docs [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components)  has the problem in all browsers as far as I have been able to test.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nbecause we are using the state to update the component as soon as it's changed, the input element should be able to keep the cursor in the same place.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI'm at latest (16.8.2) and I tested on Chrome, FireFox, and Edge on Windows\r\n\r\nas far as I know, this was working at some point, though I don't know how long ago. possibly even before \"Fiber\"\r\n\r\n",
