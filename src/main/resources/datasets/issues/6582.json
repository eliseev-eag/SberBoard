  "body": "This has come up a couple times lately as being an issue (#6479, #6581, #6511), I think perhaps because we added the minification warning and people are ending up seeing they aren't getting prod code when they expected it. But there's also the argument that you want React to be production and still use NODE_ENV for other purposes.\n\nThere would be a few things to figure out to make sure envify works, and deciding what we do for other projects which currently also use the NODE_ENV pattern (eg, Relay, fbjs, third-party code, etc).\n\nThis might not be a good idea at all though and definitely isn't happening immediately, but wanted to start the discussion.\n",
