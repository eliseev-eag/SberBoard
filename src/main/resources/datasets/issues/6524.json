  "body": "Assume the following styles object is provided to a component:\n\n``` js\nconst styles = {\n  background: 'none',\n  backgroundColor: 'red'\n};\n```\n\nPrior to v15, this would result in (in the browser's computed styles):\n\n``` css\nbackground: none;\nbackground-color: red;\n```\n\nIn React 15+, this results in (in chrome 49+):\n\n``` css\nbackground: none red;\n```\n\nIn chrome 48 it results in:\n\n``` css\nbackground: none;\n```\n\nWhat this means is in chrome 49+, it has a red background, but in chrome 48 it has no background.\n\nI'm not entirely sure who/what is at fault here. Would you be able to shed some light on the change? Is this a bug or an intended feature?\n",
