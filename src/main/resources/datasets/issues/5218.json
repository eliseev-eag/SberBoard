  "body": "With a basic React application, return null or false inside a stateless function component throws an error. But when using the shallow renderer (`ReactTestUtils.createRenderer`), no error are thrown and everything works as expected.\n\nIt's not consistent. The behavior should be the same.\n\nHere's the error received when returning `null` inside a stateless fn component using react-dom:\n\n> No 'render' method found on the returned component instance: you may have forgotten to define 'render', returned null/false from a stateless component, or tried to render an element whose type is a function that isn't a React component.\n\nAllowing it would be really great, but the error message mentioned it so I guess it's on purpose.\n",
