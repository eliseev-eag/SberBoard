It takes more than 2 seconds to finish.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt should just throw the whole container node that contains these 1000 components without doing any diffing.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16. This is something with the way react-fiber works I think. ",
