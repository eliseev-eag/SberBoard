  "body": "React 15.4.2, Chrome 56.0.2924.87 and 57.0.2987.110\r\n\r\nI have been doing some profiling in Chrome of the render performance of some of our components and noticed a couple of deoptimizations in React.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-17 at 9 21 37 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/195534/24052580/3a5b71e4-0af3-11e7-8ac4-e92f734bd1b8.png)\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-17 at 9 22 00 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/195534/24052581/3a65d666-0af3-11e7-916e-e8872b8cfdbd.png)\r\n\r\nThe message Chrome reports is \"Not optimized: optimized too many times\", which apparently happens when V8 optimizes a function but when running it found a reason to deopt it, and this happened more than `max_opt_count` setting (currently set to 10). More information: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/devtools-docs/issues/53#issuecomment-145192013\r\n\r\nClicking through the profile, it looks like most of the time is perhaps spent on this line, but I'm not sure if that is a clue as to what the deopt might be in this case.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnextProp = this._previousStyleCopy = _assign({}, nextProp);\r\n```\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-17 at 9 26 57 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/195534/24052784/f77c5072-0af3-11e7-9d11-b5fffa0d2e60.png)\r\n\r\nIt might be worth spending some time digging into this, but I'm not sure if it will still be relevant after React 16.",
