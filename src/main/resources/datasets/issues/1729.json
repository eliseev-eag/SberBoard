  "body": "I'm trying to implement a scrollable list of items that are tappable on mobile devices. It looks like there are two plugins that address the 'how to tap' problem - https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/browser/eventPlugins/MobileSafariClickEventPlugin.js & https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/browser/eventPlugins/TapEventPlugin.js .\n\nI'm confused about Plugins: they [aren't mentioned in the docs](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html), and it's unclear if they're things that you can build in runtime, with `require('react')` or which [require recompilation with Grunt](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/436). Is the plugin system itself in flux? I'd love to help out on [getting these merged](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/1170) so that developing mobile apps is more straightforward.\n",
