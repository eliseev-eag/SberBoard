I didn't do any `this.setState()`, but I modified directly the state without knowing it because of a [misuse of the spread operator from my side](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50391768/a-copy-of-an-array-with-spread-operator-modifies-the-copied-array-how-come). \r\nThus no error came to me telling me I was modifying the state directly.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nAn error like `Do not mutate state directly. Use setState()`, or even maybe a lesson about the spread operator at the same time :)\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nI use the last version of React, and I expect to have the same in all the previous versions of React.\r\n",
