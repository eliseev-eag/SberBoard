This works great but can become annoying when using 3rd party dependencies we can't control. The current solution is to wrap smaller components in strict mode and exclude the 3rd party components. The issue here is that we have just increased our work by many multiples.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have an exclude/ignore tag or prop on the React strict mode component. This would allow us to generally define a single strict mode component on the application root and then exclude other components as needed. The idea is similar to how testing frameworks work - you can include files matching certain pattern and exclude things as needed.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<React.StrictMode>\r\n  <App>\r\n    <OurComponent />\r\n    <React.StrictMode ignore>\r\n      <ThirdPartyComponent />\r\n    </React.StrictMode>\r\n  </App>\r\n</React.StrictMode>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.8.4\r\n",
