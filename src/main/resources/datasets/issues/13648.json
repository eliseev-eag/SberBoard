Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.

Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nAffected since this 16.5.0, coming from this PR exactly https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12037/files#diff-26d90cba6ee597ef475fa80dcf76ae1d\r\n\r\n`getOffsets` as a check on `ownerDocument.default` fallbacks to `window`, but `setOffsets` does not.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason why?",
