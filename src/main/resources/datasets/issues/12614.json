  "body": "Per [this blog post](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/08/dom-attributes-in-react-16.html#data-and-aria-attributes), react allows passing data attributes freely.  In React 16.2.0, on MacOS 10.13 Chrome 65, freely seems to stop short of functions.\r\n\r\nReplication steps:\r\n```js\r\nReactDOM.render(\r\n  React.createElement('h1',{['data-foo']:x=>x}),\r\n  document.getElementById('root')\r\n);\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1176527/38770227-bdae1588-3fcc-11e8-903e-d37bc3e3b69e.png)\r\n\r\nIf the behavior is expected (or not), links/recommendations on how to silence or disable it are welcome. As console errors with stack traces printed, three of those messages scroll a whole page of the console on every reload.  I'd love to find a way around it that doesn't involve hacking the app code or React just to disable a warning.  Following [this closed thread about console warn vs error](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6414) led to a currently open thread for [warning output hooks](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4302).  I'm currently trying negative lookaround regex filters in chrome dev tools, and those are locking up the dev console process.  \r\n\r\nedit: A dev tools filter of `-Invalid` solved the issue well enough for me.  Leaving this post in case it is a bug.",
