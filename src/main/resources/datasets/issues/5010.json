  "body": "The well used [`react-onclickoutside`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-onclickoutside) mixin for detecting mouse clicks outside a React Component cannot be used with ES6 classes. I have proposed a wrapper function/higher-order component/decorator in a PR at Pomax/react-onclickoutside#22.\n\nThe author @Pomax has asked me to check in and find out whether this aligns with what might become the official approach to realizing mixin-like functionality for ES6 classes before he merges it?\n\nIt seems to be becoming a _de facto standard_ with a couple of larger libraries following this approach including Yahoo's Fluxible in [`connectToStores()`](http://fluxible.io/addons/connectToStores.html) and Material UI in [`ThemeDecorator()`](http://material-ui.com/#/customization/themes). The Relay syntax also appears to be similar?\n\nThe intended use is documented with the changes in the PR mentioned above.\n",
