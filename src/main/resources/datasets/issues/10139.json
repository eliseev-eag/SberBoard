  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\n*bug*\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI get:\r\n\r\n> Warning: Unknown DOM property autocomplete. Did you mean autoComplete?\r\n\r\nWhen I use `autoComplete` works fine.\r\n\r\nThis is misleading because the name of the DOM property is `autocomplete`, not `autoComplete`. React implies that the DOM property is named differently than it really is.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/binki/84v837e9/133/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nAccepts `autocomplete`, rejects `autoComplete`.\r\n\r\n*OR*\r\n\r\nThe error message should not claim that `autoComplete` is the name of a DOM property because it isn’t. I don’t see any mention of a DOM property called `autoComplete` in the IDL documentation for [`HTMLInputElement`](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#htmlinputelement), but I do see mention of `autocomplete`. It should claim that `autoComplete` is a “React property name mapped onto a differently-named DOM property” or use some other wording (I’m not good at coming up with wordings).\r\n\r\n```js\r\n> typeof document.createElement('input').autocomplete\r\n\"string\"\r\n> typeof document.createElement('input').autoComplete\r\n\"undefined\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nreact-15.6.1\r\n\r\nSame issue exists for at least `HTMLInputElement.autofocus`.\r\n",
