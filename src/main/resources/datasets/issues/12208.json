Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n#### Component\r\n```js\r\nrender() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      {str1}\r\n      {str2}\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI use `react.hydrate` to do `SSR`.\r\nThis will show error if `str2` is \"str2\" and `str1` is \"str1\":\r\n```js\r\nWarning: Text content did not match. Server: \"str2str1\" Client: \"str1\"\r\n```\r\nBut the `client` of the `html` is the same as the `server` of the `html`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThis should not show the `Error`.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact: 16.2.0\r\nOS: Mac OS X 10.13.3\r\nBrowser: Chrome 63.0.3239.132 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n",
