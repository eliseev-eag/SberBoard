  "body": "I am noticing strange behavior with the development build vs the production build.\n\nPlease see bin: http://jsbin.com/pikokuboza/1/edit?html,js,output\n\nI have included two links to the React library (production/development). The production build works as expected and renders the Immutable.Set(). However, the development build breaks and returns this error:\n\n`Uncaught Error: Non-extensible objects are not allowed as keys.`\n\nAlso, another strange thing is that on the development build the Set() works as long as the size is under 9. Try removing 2 elements from the array so the size is 8 and it will render fine on both development and production.\n",
