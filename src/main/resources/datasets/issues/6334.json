  "body": "I've been using [emmet](https://github.com/emmetio/emmet) for a while in sublime and it occurred to me that the angle brackets were re-purposed to actually provide a useful utility (nesting). If you consider in JSX where a component is returning an xml-like syntax:\n\n```\n...\nreturn (\n<div className=\"panel\">\n   <h1>{this.props.header}</h1>\n   <p>{this.props.content}</p>\n   <a href=\"#\">{this.props.button}</a>\n</div>\n);\n```\n\nvs\n\n```\nreturn (\n  div.panel >\n    h1{this.props.header} +\n    p{this.props.content} +\n    a[href=\"#\"]{this.props.button}\n)\n```\n\nYou can see that it would be much more succinct to remove the brackets. Although it's not as easily readable, it's much faster to write.\n\nCurrently, angle brackets are not serving a purpose other than delineating a tag. We can assume the returned output will be a tag, so therefore it could be more useful to re-purpose the usage to stating a nested hierarchy.\n\nJust an idea, but I thought it was worth mentioning.\n",
