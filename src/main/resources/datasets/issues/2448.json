  "body": "Too often I run into this:\n\n```\n Invariant Violation: _registerComponent(...): Target container is not a DOM element.\n```\n\nwhen making a new project / example.\n\nThe reason is [I'm passing `document.body` but React's script is in `head`](http://stackoverflow.com/a/26566330/458193) and body doesn't exist yet.\n\nThis is very common problem as I observed for beginners, as they tend to put their scripts in `head` but React samples use `document.body` as mounting point.\n\nThe real problem here is the message: you wouldn't believe that `document.body` \"is not a DOM element\" and assume something else is wrong, without realizing it may be empty at the time.\n\nI suggest we show a different, more specific warning when second argument is `null` _and_ `document.body` is `null`. Something like \"Target container is null. Are you trying to mount to `document.body` before it is ready?\"\n",
