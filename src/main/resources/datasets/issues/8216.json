  "body": "I am currently trying to get familiar with the Fiber codebase and IMO the best way to get up to speed is to work with the code.\r\nSo I started working on adding context support and got some tests passing for it however I am not sure if this is a good approach and I would appreciate some feedback on the work. All flows are not implemented yet.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if I should utilize the Fiber more, right now I have `childContext` there which seems to break the pattern with `memoized` and `pending`. e.g maybe `childContext` could be renamed to `memoizedChildContext` but I am not sure what pending would be. Feedback would be helpful.",
