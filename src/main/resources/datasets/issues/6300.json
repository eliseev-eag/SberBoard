  "body": "I'm not sure if this is a desired feature, but I thought it would be nice to have an easy way to make custom `propType` validators required or optional. This patch essentially adds a new property to `ReactPropTypes` called `custom`. You pass it a custom validator function, and it just wraps that validator in `createChainableTypeChecker`.\n\n``` javascript\npropTypes: {\n  warning: React.PropTypes.custom(\n    function (props, propName) {\n      if (!props[propName].startsWith('WARNING: ')) {\n        return new Error('`warning` prop must start with \\'WARNING: \\'');\n      }\n    }\n  ).isRequired,\n},\n```\n\nOn the one hand, it requires you to add a little more code since you're no longer just passing a raw function, but I think it adds the nice benefit of making it simple to enforce required custom-validated `props`. Should passing an unwrapped function still be supported?\n\nAs I write this, it occurs to me (after writing the implementation and tests, sigh) that if you want to make a required custom validator, you can add an `if (!props[propName])` conditional to the body, heh. But this solution makes it a little more idiomatic...?\n\nWhat do you all think?\n",
