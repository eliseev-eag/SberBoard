  "body": "In case it's not obvious, I've been watching Ember a lot lately and I'm pretty jealous of their docs efforts getting to 1.0 and beyond. They've started working on \"cookbooks\" (https://github.com/emberjs/website/issues/663), which I think is an awesome idea. So I want to steal it :)\n\nThis could really help cut down on some of the time we spend answering questions. It would also just be an awesome resource.\n",
