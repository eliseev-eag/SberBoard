  "body": "It could be helpful to have a sample project that would centralize in a single place all React's best practices to build a component (something simple, like for example a custom input field), both stateless and stateful. Also it could be an excellent starting point for providing migration steps with actual code rather than bullets in a document, like it happened with 0.14 release.\n\nAdditionally, this could evolve into something like integration with some Node.js tooling (linting with ESLint, transpiling with Babel, package management and bundling with Webpack / JSPM), a small testing infrastructure etc. and why not publishing it as a Yeoman generator.\n\nDisclaimer: this is not an issue with React itself, but rather a proposal for better supporting React development.\n",
