  "body": "I went through many articles on server side rendering of react and the all of them has the following in common :-\r\n\r\n- The server route renders a complete html page with a div which wraps the root react component, just like traditional react code\r\n- it also includes reference to a bundle.js which is called by browser once the skeleton is loaded and the view re-renders with all javascript functionality.\r\nThis approach always leads me to download my whole frontend app in one go. Is there any way where I can selectively render react components in divs? . What I mean to say is, for example \"/graph\" only gives me graph component, \"/table\" only gives me table component etc so that :-\r\n\r\n-I can embed react components into a pre-existing webapp.\r\n\r\nThe response from the routes are just smaller components instead of the whole outer root component. I know react can be embedded in other web apps in case of client side rendering, but I am wondering if same thing can be achieved in server side rendering. Thanks.",
