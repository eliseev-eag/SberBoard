  "body": "Currently there is only the option to have `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, but there is no way to create a raw HTML output (like a HTML comment).\r\n\r\nFor the background where I'm heading to with my feature-request:\r\nI am tinkering with ReactJS (latest version __16.9.0__) as some kind of static website generator where ReactJS should be used as the \"templating engine\". As I do not want to run a nodejs-server, or React at all on the resulting website, __SSR is no option__ for me (and please don't advocate me to use SSR).\r\n\r\nAs I am using `renderToStaticMarkup` of the `react-dom/server`, I can not use the existing ways like manipulating the \"DOM\"-node, because `componentDidMount` and `useEffect` do not work here.\r\n\r\nFor reference, I tried these tricks without luck (please ignore the asked question on SO, I only talk about the code of the given answers):\r\n* useEffect: https://stackoverflow.com/a/56118306/1961102\r\n* componentDidMount: https://stackoverflow.com/a/41131326/1961102\r\n\r\nThis topic was asked in some different ways, but not in combination with `outerHTML`. I think these issues might be related to this:\r\n\r\n`A way to return raw HTML from an unmounted component?`\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7374\r\n\r\n`What does dangerouslySetInnerHTML prop do? How is it achieved?`\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14509\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nThere is no way.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n\r\nIf possible, I would like to have a way without having to deal with any \"workaround\"-construct\r\n```jsx\r\n<React.RawText text={\"<!-- some HTML comment -->\"} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf possible, I would like to have a way without having to deal with a `<div />`\r\n```jsx\r\n<React.Fragment rawUnsafeHTML={{__html: \"<!-- some HTML comment -->\"}} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherwise by using a div as some kind of \"transport-object\"\r\n```jsx\r\n<div dangerouslySetOuterHTML={{__html: \"<!-- some HTML comment -->\"}} />\r\n```",
