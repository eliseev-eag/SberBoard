But it almost works.\r\n\r\nNot very happy with different host context types in DEV and PROD but I don't know how else to avoid extra allocations in PROD.\r\n\r\nIt is annoying to have to recalculate own context for non-reified text in host components so I probably need to pass own context to hosts. Also I might need to add something like `getRootHostContext` to avoid passing root instance to every `getChildContext`.",
