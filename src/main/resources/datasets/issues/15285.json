  "body": "To implement `delayHoverStart` and `delayHoverEnd` there are many situations such as below:\r\n\r\n**First**\r\nWhen start delay timeout greater than or equal to the end delay timeout. no worries about this, because both of `mouseover` and `mouseout` events will be run perfectly.\r\n\r\n**Second**\r\nWhen start delay timeout less than end delay. In this situation, there are three options\r\n   - We can clear start delay and JUST run end delay but we will lose `mouseover` event.\r\n   - We can keep both of them but maybe `mouseout` event runs before `mouseover`\r\n   - We can check by `end >= start` as always\r\n\r\nI was wondering which one could be more useful.",
