  "body": "This API was removed because it was undocumented and existed solely for our JSXTransformer/react-tools, which haven't been supported for a year. However it turns out TypeScript is still using this API in their TSX compilation and it kind of sucks to break people who want to upgrade React but not the rest of their toolchain.\n\n~~Note: this doesn't quite (read at all) work with the `Object.assign` -> `object-assign` transform I wrote so would need to fix that too.~~\n",
