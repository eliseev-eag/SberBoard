But the problem is that doesn't give any error on Yarn. Error raises on *mac* and *linux*. I couldn't test in on *windows*. I installed `cjs` and `scheduler` packages for fixing this but it didn't help.\r\n\r\np.s.: It was working smoothly on `react 16.5.0`. With new experimental schedule, It's started to give an error. We are not using this experimental feature.\r\n\r\nError:\r\n```\r\nERROR in ./node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.production.min.js\r\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve 'schedule' in '/Users/x/Project/x/node_modules/react-dom/cjs'\r\n @ ./node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.production.min.js 13:67-86\r\n @ ./node_modules/react-dom/index.js\r\n @ ./src/client/index.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n- `rm -rf node_modules && npm i`\r\n- build with webpack\r\n- - It will give error\r\n- `rm -rf node_modules && yarn`\r\n- build with webpack\r\n- - Build is success\r\n\r\nI can also share my webpack setup but I think it's not related that.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt should work on npm and yarn.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n- React : 16.5.2\r\n- React-dom : 16.5.2\r\n- Node.js : 8.11.4\r\n- NPM : 5.6.0\r\n- Yarn : 1.9.4\r\n\r\nWorking version:\r\n- React : 16.5.0\r\n- React-dom : 16.5.0\r\n- Node.js : 8.11.4\r\n- NPM : 5.6.0\r\n- Yarn : 1.9.4\r\n",
