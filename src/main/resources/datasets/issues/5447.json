  "body": "So, I feel like componentDidUpdate and references are executing in the wrong order.\n\nBackground: I'm working on a situation where you're in a list of input fields, with a blank row of fields at the bottom. When you press enter in any field, it moves your focus to the next one by talking to a register which keeps track of all the fields and their positions. Shift+enter goes in reverse as well.\n\nIf you press enter on the final field, it kicks off a Flux like action which results in the next blank field being rendered, and then I want to move focus to that row. So I set up a callback that will fire on the next componentDidUpdate, knowing that when that happens, I'll have access to the new Field, which registers itself during componentWillMount. That works just fine, I can access that component just fine, however, if I want to use a method to direct focus to a DOM Element within it, it will be too early to make use of references:\n\n``` js\nconst FieldComponent = React.createClass({\n  receiveFocus: function() {\n    ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this.refs.input).focus() // error: this.refs.input == undefined\n  },\n  render: function() {\n    return React.DOM.div({},\n      React.DOM.label({}, \"Some Label\"),\n      React.DOM.input({ref: \"input\", type: \"text\"})\n    )\n  }\n})\n```\n\n...because the references have not yet been bound, even though we're at the componentDidMount/Update stage of the lifecycle, so this...\n\n``` js\n  receiveFocus: function() {\n    console.log(Object.keys(this.refs)) // log: []\n    setTimeout(function() {\n      console.log(Object.keys(this.refs)) // log: [\"input\"]\n    },  0)\n  },\n```\n\n...seems to indicate that reference binding happens synchronously after. Now, I could easily get around this by using ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this) and then using querySelector to find my target, but that isn't a clean `React` way to go about solving the issue, I believe based on what I know of the API that references should be bound/executed before componentDidUpdate/Mount fires. Does this not occur by design, mistake, or incompatibility with other goals?\n",
