  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**  Bug\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\n\nIn Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc when using an `input` with `type='search'` clicking the clear button (the \"X\" on the right) triggers the React onChange event. In IE11 (and probably earlier versions) the onChange event does not fire even though the input is cleared.  `onInput` DOES get fired in IE11 when the search box is cleared.\n\nhttp://jsbin.com/sizaba/3/edit?html,js,console,output\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n\nThe React `onChange` event will consistently fire in IE11 as well.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\nReact 15.1+ is definitely affected. Not sure if it worked previously. IE11 is affected, but other browsers including Edge do not appear to be.\n",
