The issue is that we null out `nextUnitOfWork` as we traverse up during completion, but we also don't attempt to find an error boundary if `nextUnitOfWork` is null:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/b305c4e034bbb3b13df2028c0503a84f91e57455/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberScheduler.js#L1280-L1284\r\n\r\nSo errors in completion phase don't look for boundaries at all right now.",
