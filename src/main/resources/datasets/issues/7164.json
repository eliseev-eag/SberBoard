  "body": "Instead of exposing the entire DOM renderer on the react.js package, I only expose CurrentOwner and ComponentTreeDevtool which are currently the only two modules that share **state** with the renderers.\n\nThen I package each renderer in its own package. That could allow us to drop more server dependencies from the client package. It will also allow us to ship Fiber as a separate renderer.\n\n```\nUnminified DEV            after     before\nreact.js                  123kb     696kb\nreact-with-addons.js      227kb     774kb\nreact-dom.js              600kb     1kb\nreact-dom-server.js       570kb     1kb\n```\n\n```\nMinified PROD             after     before\nreact.min.js               24kb     154kb\nreact-with-addons.min.js   37kb     166kb\nreact-dom.min.js          136kb     1kb\nreact-dom-server.min.js   131kb     1kb\n```\n\nThe total size for react.min.js + react-dom.min.js is +5kb larger because of the overlap between them right now. I'd like to see what an optimizing compiler can do to this. Some of that is fbjs stuff. There shouldn't need to be that much overlap so that's something we can hunt. We should keep isomorphic absolutely minimal so there's no reason for other React clones not to use it. There will be less overlap with Fiber.\n\nI like this strategy because it encourages us to keep isomorphic really minimal.\n\nHowever, another strategy that we could do is package the isomorphic package into each renderer bundle and conditionally initialize it if it hasn't already been initialized. That way you only pay an overlap tax when there are two renderers on the page but not with one. It's also easier to just pull in one package. The downside is the versioning stuff that the separate npm package would solve. That applies to CDNs as well.\n\nReactWithAddons is a bit weird because it is packaged into the isomorphic package but has a bunch of DOM dependencies. So we have to load them lazily since the DOM package gets initialized after.\n\ncc @zpao @kittens @gaearon\n",
