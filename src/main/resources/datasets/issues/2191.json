  "body": "If I need a component that doesn't have a DOM representation, I can use render function that returns `<noscript>`. However recently I had to have a component without DOM representation, but that also has children, that I want to be mounted (so that their lifecycle methods trigger correctly). Unfortunately `<noscript>` is not nestable, thus I had to return `<span>`, which is not an ideal solution.\n\nIs there a way to do such thing without using `<span>` or `<div>`? I know there are plans to replace `<noscript>` solution with some 'null component'. Are there plans for 'null component' that can mount its children?\n",
