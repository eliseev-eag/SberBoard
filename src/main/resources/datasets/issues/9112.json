  "body": "Hey, at the moment the docs at https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/docs/docs/higher-order-components.md (and in https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/higher-order-components.html#static-methods-must-be-copied-over) say that static methods need to be copied over.\r\n\r\nHowever, class inheritance in JavaScript also works for static properties.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass Base {\r\n  static get x() { return 5; }\r\n}\r\nclass Sub extends Base {}\r\nconsole.log(Sub.x); // 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooking at the recommended `hoist-non-react-statics` it looks like it just [copies the properties over](https://github.com/mridgway/hoist-non-react-statics/blob/master/index.js#L41) but `extends` is supposed to do that (with prototypical inheritance) anyway.\r\n\r\nIs this an error in the docs (from a time ES2015 classes were not used, in ES5 `Function.prototype` extension this doesn't work - only with classes)?
