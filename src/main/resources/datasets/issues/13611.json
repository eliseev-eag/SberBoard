  "body": "As we found internally, https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13423 broke the persistent mode used by Fabric.\r\n\r\nWe should still clone if children are unchanged, but there's no need to calculate the diff between identical props. I forked the implementation into mutating and persistent paths, kept the simple check in the mutating mode, and rearranged the code a bit in the persistent mode to combine it with the existing bailout.\r\n\r\nI added a new test suite based on `ReactIncrementalUpdatesMinimalism` but tweaked for the clone case. This way we won't regress it again.",
