  "body": "Adds a missing tag check before calling passive effects.\r\n\r\nThe reason we didn't catch this earlier is because it happens to accidentally work even without the check in most cases.\r\n\r\nI added a regression test but it's very specific and weird and you should feel free to delete it later if the implementation details change and it causes you problems. I split this into the first commit to show that the test fails.\r\n\r\nThe second commit adds the tag check, to show that it fixes the test.",
