  "body": "This essentially copies all classic element creation tests to the modern\nJSX tests. The classic tests doesn't use JSX and modern tests do.\n\nThe idea is that the JSX tests can start dropping dynamic checks once\nwe have Flow support for those features. JSX won't be necessary for\ndropping dynamic checks. Plain object will also work. Flow will also not\nbe necessary for JSX. However, the tests should test for the suggested\ncombination (JSX + Flow).\n\nThis also moves some misplaced tests to ReactDOM and Validator.\n\nNote that the modern tests uses ES6 classes. I will add separate tests for\nthose. However, these are not guaranteed to have .displayName so all our\nerror messages should check .name if available instead. This should be\nbetter abstracted but I just adhoc fix this for now.\n",
