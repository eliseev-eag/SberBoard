  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIn this case, the form uses controlled inputs and .checkValidity() method is called on every change. If the user tries to fix text on any position inside an input and form is invalid, then caret goes at the end immediately after typing one symbol. Caret behaves similarly when .checkValidity() method is called on invalid input. All is fine if the form is valid.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle or CodeSandbox example below:**\r\nExample: https://jsfiddle.net/n5u2wwjg/48956/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nCaret saves its position after user input with any form/input state, valid or not.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nTested with React 16.2, 16.3 and 16.4, with Chrome and Firefox on Ubuntu. React 16.2 doesn't have this bug, behaves as expected. But with 16.3 and 16.4 this bug is easily reproduced.",
