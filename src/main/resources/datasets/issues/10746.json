  "body": "Hi everyone!  This PR definitely isn't ready to go in yet (tests, code style, and CLA all still need to be completed), but I wanted to get it up here to try and foster some discussion.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no way to listen to the `selectionchange` event unless you do it outside the React Event System.  I was wondering if there was room to add that functionality.\r\n\r\nI know that the current `onSelect` plugin is a bit different then the actual `select` event listener.  And that it actually will try to use `selectionchange` if possible.  I wasn't sure if this improvement would require a whole new type of event, or if we should just augment `onSelect`.\r\n\r\nThoughts?  ",
