  "body": "Currently React allows installing event handler on DOM events only in declarative fashion, via component attributes at the time of a component instantiation.\n\nI think this is nice and allows automatically uninstall such handlers in case of a component disposal. But for implementing some \"low-level\" machinery I think it would be useful to allow handlers to be installed after the component instantiation at arbitrary moments. That would allow installing an event handler in a mixin's `componentDidMount` (with a corresponding uninstall of such event handler in `componentWillUnmount`) callback.\n\nFor example currently I use jQuery for trapping clicks on anchors and invoking HTML5 pushState API instead of letting a browser to reload a page:\n\n```\n  ...\n  componentDidMount: function() {\n    $(this.getDOMNode()).on('click.react-route', 'a', function(e) {\n      e.preventDefault();\n      // invoke HTML5 pushState API\n    });\n  },\n\n  componentWillUnmount: function() {\n    $(this.getDOMNode()).off('click.react-route');\n  }\n ...\n```\n\nThe problem with that is I'm not able to use goodies provided by React's event plugins. So what I want instead is to handle click events with React's event system and install such handler in `componentDidMount` callback so I can extract such functionality into a mixin. Something like:\n\n```\n  ...\n  handleClick: function(e) {\n    // check if event's target is an anchor and invoke pushState API\n  },\n\n  componentDidMount: function() {\n    this.addEventListener(eventTypes.onClick, this.handleClick);\n  },\n\n  componentWillUnmount: function() {\n    this.removeEventListener(eventTypes.onClick, this.handleClick);\n  }\n ...\n```\n\nThough maybe `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` names are to verbose...\n\nOther examples include handling focus/blur and arrow key clicks to control focus inside a component, ...\n",
