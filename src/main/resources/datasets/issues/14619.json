The wording is confusing, but `true` and `false` in the explanation for `aria-current` are not valid tokens -- that is just the evaluated state for the accessibility engine.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEDIT: Oops. reading _even further_ down the spec, it does seem that `\"false\"` is supposed to be a falsy value too, so this is not a \"bug\" as in wrong behavior per se. It'd still be better to omit the attribute entirely, though.",
