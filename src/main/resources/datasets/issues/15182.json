  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nA rerender (after say, interacting with form element) seems to make useContext grab the wrong context. This behavior seems to have been introduced in the space between 16.8.0-alpha.1, and 16.8.0.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nIn the following codesandbox, modify the \"address\" field, and watch react complain about the component going from uncontrolled to controlled — https://codesandbox.io/s/o72wo7ypvq\r\nThen try the same thing here: https://codesandbox.io/s/8k8pyjrol0 and notice no error. There are two instances of useContext nested within two providers. The error is triggered by an update to a form field within the innermost context instead getting the outer context \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nas shown here: https://codesandbox.io/s/8k8pyjrol0 — we're keeping the inner context as expected\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nYes. this worked in 16.8.0-alpha.1 (also worked in the 16.7 alphas), but does not work in 16.8.0 through 16.8.4 (I tested each version individually)",
