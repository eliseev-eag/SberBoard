As soon as i insert dot, cursor stars to jump in input.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\nIt is not working in Chrome `v53` on React `v15.3.2` and also `v15.3.1`. I did not try to go very far back, but i tried it on old JSBin with React `v0.13.2` and that worked.\n\nOn Firefox it is correctly **working**.\n",
