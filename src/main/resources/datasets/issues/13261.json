  "body": "fix #11911 \r\n\r\nI had to move `validateDOMNesting` into the flattening process so it causes a different warning message. I'm not sure if this is a right approach.\r\n\r\n## The problem\r\nAfter the investigation, I got that the reason of crash was desynchronization of Fiber and real node.\r\n`<option />` flattens its children, while Fiber does not. So we can pass into `<option />` an array of children e.g.\r\n```\r\n['some', <div>5</div>, null, ' string']\r\n```\r\nIt flattens to a string\r\n```\r\n'some string'\r\n```\r\nBut Fiber keeps links to all children. Let's assume that `null` depends on some state. Fiber will try to update children using `insertBefore`, but as we don't have a real node in DOM, it caused a runtime error.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n`<option />`'s children should be a string and we have to filter children. The simplest solution was to allow react to set content as a direct text child. It solves the issue and makes a behavior of `<option />` like in React v.15.*.*. Unfortunately, this solution leads us to skip `validateDOMNesting`.\r\n\r\n",
