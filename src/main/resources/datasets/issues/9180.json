  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n*Feature*\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nCurrently, when you declare \r\n`TitleBar.propTypes = {\r\n  title: React.PropTypes.string.isRequired\r\n};`\r\n\r\nAnd then declare\r\n`TitleBar.defaultProps = {\r\n  title: 'Default Title'\r\n}`\r\n\r\nWhen you go ahead and use the `<TitleBar/>` component without declaring the title prop no error is thrown (like is supposed to happen when using isRequired). Based on the documentation ([here](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html)) it states \r\n\r\n> The propTypes typechecking happens after defaultProps are resolved, so typechecking will also apply to the defaultProps.\r\n\r\nSo this is expected behavior. I think when a user is using `isRequired` there should at least be a warning to change the propType typechecking to optional. \r\n\r\nAlso I'd love to try and fix this myself so if I could get some pointers that would be much appreciated as I've never contributed to React before.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact version 15.4.2, Running Chrome on Mac OS X El Capitan V 10.11.6",
