  "body": "We support uncontrolled components (although we do not necessarily encourage them) and it seems to me that this is a utility that is of relevance to a handful of such use-cases, especially in more complex situations. I.e. where you have a stateful component which you need to reset, say a rich-text editor or in my case of [ReactSWF](https://github.com/syranide/react-swf) a running SWF, in response to some user action. **EDIT:** Think of it as a complement to `React.findDOMNode(inputRef).value = 'foobar'`.\n\nThis can currently be worked around by providing a monotonic `key`, but that's really just a hack and not a neat solution.\n\nThis is very much in the more obscure end of the spectrum but seems like a missing feature in-terms of being \"feature complete\" for uncontrolled components. So I'm not really going to push hard for this (especially as it could be _really_ obscure and the above hack might really be the best trade-off, also considering batching).\n",
