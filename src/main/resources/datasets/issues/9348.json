The ref attribute instead refers to the HOC.\r\n\r\nIn order for the parent component to reference the child component, it must use some of the below popular workarounds:\r\nonRef prop\r\nhttps://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/issues/909\r\n\r\ninnerRef prop\r\nhttps://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/122\r\n\r\ngetInstance func\r\nhttps://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/308\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIn accordance with the decorator pattern, a child wrapped with a HOC should not be less accessible than a child not wrapped with a HOC. It is expected that the ref attribute pass through the HOC.\r\n",
