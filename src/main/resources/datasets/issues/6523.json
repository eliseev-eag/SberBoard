People seem to like it.\n\nObviously we're not ready to deprecate our own test utils in favor of Enzyme, but I think we're doing our users a disservice if we don't communicate it as an alternative (or at least something to be aware of).  This adds a note encouraging people to check it out.\n\ncc @spicyj @gaearon \n",
