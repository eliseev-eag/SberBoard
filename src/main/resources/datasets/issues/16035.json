  "body": "- 'Saves' a reference to the handle+root in a Map whenever `scheduleTimeout` is called\r\n- On exiting an `act()` scope, flushes them out, and clears the Map entry\r\n- Added a test for the same, and updated another that expected differently. \r\n\r\nI wrote just the one test for this, but I'm keen to add more coverage. Any pointers to what other tests could be useful?",
