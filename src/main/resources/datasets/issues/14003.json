  "body": "I'm currently working on replacing Jest's custom fake timers implementation with Lolex (https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/5171). As part of that, I wanted to test that React's tests still work. They didn't...\r\n\r\nA quirk of Jest's current implementation is that we schedule `process.nextTick` and `setImmediate` on the real timers, even though they're faked. Then we just make sure to do nothing if Jest invoked the function when advancing time, or vice versa if Node triggered it before us. That behavior is intentionally _not_ re-implemented in the new version.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes from using `setImmediate` to `Promise.resolve().then()` to \"wait 1 tick\" which behaves the same.",
