  "body": "In case anybody else stumbles across this old blog post, I wanted to submit a patch to help with unhandled rejections.  \r\n\r\n`#then` and `#catch` each return new Promise instances, so here we actually create two new promises (that aren't assigned).  If the argument promise to `#makeCancelable` rejects, the promise created by `#then` will be an unhandled rejection, which in Node 7 will be an uncaught error.  \r\n\r\nBy using the second argument of `#then` to handle rejections instead, we don't need to worry about the runtime finding any unhandled rejections here.",
