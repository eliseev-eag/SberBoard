  "body": "**WIP, doesn’t work**\r\n\r\nI want to follow up on https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/14104#discussion_r231288310 and try to simplify this logic.\r\n\r\nSo far, I've tried to separate `beginWorkInDEV` that would call `beingWork` and fall back to `replay` in a `catch` block. A dozen tests are currently failing with a context mismatch or something like this, but I’m not sure why. I also realized that there might be a reason replaying calls `workLoop` rather than `beginWork` directly (which seems like it would be simpler?) — for example, `beginWork` might assume the profiler timer has already started. So we need to make sure that any initialization that happens prior to `beginWork` also happens on the replay code path, or revert to calling `workLoop`.",
