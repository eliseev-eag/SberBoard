  "body": "Currently if you add a new ReactTransitionGroup with some children during a\nrender pass, the children are transitioned. This is generally not desirable\n(e.g. if adding a transition-enabled list that already has some items, you don't\nwant to transition all of the initial items when first rendering the list).\n\nThis diff makes it so that entry transitions are applied only when the\ntransition group already exists. This is implemented by applying entry\ntransitions only when the group has already been mounted.\n",
