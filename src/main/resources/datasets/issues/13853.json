  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nbug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen trying to access the event object inside setState's function body this working is shown:\r\n```\r\nWarning: This synthetic event is reused for performance reasons. If you're seeing this, you're accessing the method `*` on a released/nullified synthetic event. This is a no-op function. If you must keep the original synthetic event around, use event.persist(). See https://fb.me/react-event-pooling for more information.\r\n```\r\nIt works fine when passing a plain object to setState.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/5mrjwmlr8n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt should be possible to access event object in setState function.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nlatest one, not sure",
