  "body": "I am building frontend with browserify (+ reactify), and I found out, that when some of my components use `var React = require('react');` and others use `var React = require('react/addons');` then it seems like that each set of components has a different instance of React that don't talk to each other. \n\nThis means that if I instantiate my app with \n\n```\nvar React = require('react'); // no addons\nvar App = require('./components/App.jsx');\nReact.render(<App />, document.body);\n```\n\nwhile my components use `var React = require('react/addons'); // with addons`, then it seems that any events fired by such components aren't handled (for example `onClick={this.onClick}` isn't called) - seemingly because their instance of React is different one than the instance that rendered the root. \n\nWhen I replaced all `require('react')` calls in my app with `require('./oneReact.js')` where oneReact.js looks like this:\n\n```\nvar React = require('react/addons');\nmodule.exports = React;\n```\n\nall events started being handled again.\n\nIs this behavior a bug or by design?\n",
