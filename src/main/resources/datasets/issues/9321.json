  "body": "Now that flat bundles are mostly done (https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9327), separating out followup work into a separate issue.\r\n\r\n- [x] Should `ReactDebugCurrentFrame` be in isomorphic package? https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9365\r\n- [x] Does `--extractErrors` fully work? It does update the file, but I'm still seeing \"out of sync\" console spam on rebuilds.\r\n- [x] What happens if user forgets to envify `process.env.NODE_ENV` with webpack or use dead code elimination? Would it bundle both bundles? Sounds like even worse than what happens now. Would the user see any warnings?\r\n- [x] Wrap CommonJS bundles into conditions https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9361\r\n- [x] Add a way to see bundle size change\r\n- [x] Address internal FB `invariant` issue (I think they wanted it to be ignored so it's used verbatim)\r\n- [x] Figure out RN rollout strategy\r\n  - [x] When does it go 100% Fiber? Do we switch to flat bundles after that?\r\n  - [x] See https://github.com/gaearon/react/commit/db1f7044d159d3ef2b29dbb7b42e9891a7d27cf4 for possible workaround for circular injection\r\n  - [x] Flat ReactNative bundle would require flat React bundle but that's not what's shipped on npm\r\n- [x] Make sure error codes transform still works\r\n- [x] Add a fixture for ReactART\r\n- [x] Make a final decision on how we bundle server renderer\r\n- [x] Remove `providesModule` in source\r\n- [x] Maybe reduce duplication between UMD bundles (e.g. put `object-assign` on React internals) https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10671\r\n- [x] Convert source to ES6 modules\r\n- [x] Update release documentation\r\n- [ ] <s>Extract shared state to npm package</s>\r\n- [x] Use named imports in more places (eg event system)\r\n- [x] Figure out a static injection mechanism for www and RN\r\n- [ ] Investigate mangling and GCC optimizations\r\n- [ ] Figure out how to share build process with third party renderers (e.g. ART for starters)\r\n- [ ] Simplify the default build process to not run FB bundle builds, come up with a better strategy for FB only builds maybe?",
