Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n1. tap to focus input\r\n2. tap outside of input to blur it\r\n3. observe focus is kept\r\n\r\nexample repo: https://codesandbox.io/s/k351z189vo\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nTapping outside of the input should blur the input and remove focus\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nThis only affects iOS, android still maintains the same expected behavior.",
