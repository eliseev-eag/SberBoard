  "body": "When using [CSS custom properties](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-variables/) as inline styles, React logs the following to the console in dev mode:\n\n> `Warning: Unsupported style property --color-accent. Did you mean -colorAccent? Check the render method of 'Hello'.`\n\nDemo: https://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/48528/\n\nThis is logged in `/lib/CSSPropertyOperations.js` from `warnHyphenatedStyleName()` and `warnValidStyle()` before it. More importantly than the warning, though, the styles are not applied to the elements on the client side, in both dev and production. They _are_ applied in a server rendering ( and maybe initial client render? ), but not on the client side if those elements are taken out of the DOM and put back in from state changes. See #932 for more info. \n\nThis affects me on chrome and react@15.2.1.\n",
