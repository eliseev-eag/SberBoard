  "body": "I faced a \"bug\" today that made me spent 1h figuring out what was going on:\r\n\r\nI'm using an external component that accepts a `color` prop in order to set the `background-color` of the root element, but this same component also accepts a `background` prop which I wasn't passing, and by default, it was set to `''`.\r\n\r\nThe result: React didn't throw an error nor a warning, however, the resulting element in the DOM didn't contain either `background-color` or `background`, and since the element had a default `background-color` coming from a CSS class, it took me a while to figure out why the color that I was passing wasn't being applied, and instead it was using the one from the CSS class.\r\n\r\nSee: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-example-8rxc8\r\n\r\nWhat I reported above was the `static1` case.\r\n\r\nI added other cases as a bonus, as when I was playing with this they also seemed weird to me. On `static2` I define the same properties, but because I change the order, it works. On the toggleable ones, initially I can see the background, but after changing it never appears anymore.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I created those extra \"test cases\" correctly. My main concern is really around static1 not outputting anything on the console as a warning.\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\n#6348\r\n#8689\r\n\r\nI wonder if #14181 (@sophiebits) should have covered this?",
