  "body": "Dear all,\n\nI'm pretty new to React. For some reasons I want to use it without JSX, and I faced an issue I can't resolve: if in the react's element properties you have a `class` key instead of `className` key (for example), in the console you'll see a warning: `Warning: Unknown DOM property class. Did you mean className?`. Okay, I really mean `className`, now how can I find it? I mean where I supposed to look first? In the fb's react plugin for chrome I don't see \"wrong\" attribute, warning don't give me any stack trace either. If I have a huge DOM it's very hard to go thru it manually, without any hints. Does it possible to find any workaround?\n\n[Here you can see an example](http://jsbin.com/zarimegenu/1/)\n",
