  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIf an element requests fullscreen but a parent element has a onKeyDown binding, when in fullscreen, the keydown events do not bubble up to the onKeyDown binding.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nReproduce: https://jsfiddle.net/a4dopckg/\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\n1. Click on the text and start typing\r\n2. You will see the keyboard strokes appear below the text\r\n3. You will also see the strokes being logged to the console\r\n4. Click the toggle fullscreen button\r\n5. You won't see anything (probably a limitation of jsfiddle) but type a few more strokes\r\n6. You will see the strokes logged in the console.\r\n7. Click 'Esc' to exit fullscreen and you will see that the latest keyboard strokes did not appear below the text\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI would expect the React onKeyDown binding to receive the keydown events, just as the document.addEventListener does, even in fullscreen.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nChrome 70, Mac OSX 10.12.6 Sierra\r\nReact 16.5.1",
