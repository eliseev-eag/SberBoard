Maybe.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/oyn139b4/2/\r\n\r\nAn array passed as props gets transformed into an object, meaning that attempting to call array methods on the props in the component fails. This behaviour, and why it happens/is necessary, is not documented anywhere.\r\n\r\nThere was a warning added to this effect in [pull 6134](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6134) but it's gone AWOL somewhere along the line.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n1. Update React to not mangle arrays of props.\r\n\r\n-or-\r\n\r\n1. Add an explanation as to why props cannot be a non-object to the React documentation.\r\n2. Restore the warning added in pull 6134 to prevent people from making this mistake in the future.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nLatest, all browsers/OSes, don't know.",
