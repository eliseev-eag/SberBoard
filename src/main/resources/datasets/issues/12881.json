It will be ignored.\r\n    in div (created by App)\r\n    in App\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nAlthough pointer events are [not supported by Apple](https://caniuse.com/#feat=pointer), they are still useful to developers targeting other platforms. Perhaps a good middle ground would be to allow them, but print a console warning saying they may not work. Happy to put together a PR if someone points me in the right direction!",
