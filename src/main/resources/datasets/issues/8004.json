  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nPossible bug\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\naccording to selenium spec and based on issues reported the `.clear()` method triggers an DOM onChange event [spec](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html#element-clear), [issue](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/1841)\nHowever, when using clear, my input onChange handler is not being triggered, in the browser I can see the input as empty\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nexpect onChange handler to trigger\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\nusing React 15.2 - reproduced on both firefox & chrome - latest version as of this post\n",
