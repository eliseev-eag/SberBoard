  "body": "Suppose a Backbone View named A, which contains a React component B. In B(React) there's a button, clicking the button unnmounts B(React) and rerenders A(Backbone). In my case I got an error like:\n\n```\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'firstChild' of undefined f163bb52.main.min.js:7\n```\n\nAfter looking into it, I found events still processing even after that component unmounted from DOM. By examining `processingEventQueue` I found that event is that click event to do all this.\n\n``` js\n  /**\n   * Dispatches all synthetic events on the event queue.\n   *\n   * @internal\n   */\n  processEventQueue: function() {\n    // Set `eventQueue` to null before processing it so that we can tell if more\n    // events get enqueued while processing.\n    var processingEventQueue = eventQueue;\n    eventQueue = null;\n    forEachAccumulated(processingEventQueue, executeDispatchesAndRelease); <-- error from here\n    (\"production\" !== \"development\" ? invariant(\n      !eventQueue,\n      'processEventQueue(): Additional events were enqueued while processing ' +\n      'an event queue. Support for this has not yet been implemented.'\n    ) : invariant(!eventQueue));\n  },\n```\n\nFor now I added `setTimeout`(100ms) in my click handler and it became ok.\n\nIs there any plan to fix this case and React will just work with a timeout?\n",
