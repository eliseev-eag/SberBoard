  "body": "This PR does two things:\r\n\r\n- Rather than register events on the `document`, we now instead register on `document.body` if available, otherwise we fallback to `document`. We do this to allow for `stopPropagation` on native events to play nicely with event tracking tooling. They all typically listen on `window`, `document` or `document.body` in the `capture` phase. To ensure we don't break, we move React Flare events to `document.body`, meaning that `stopPropagation` in this phase won't block any of those such use-cases. \r\n\r\n- Adds the optional prop of `stopPropagation` to `<Press>`. This will now apply `stopPropagation` on all events that Press listens to. To ensure `mouseup` and `touchend `correctly get propagation stopped (this solves many internal use-cases), we always listen to these events.\r\n\r\nThis fixes a whole load of internal use-cases. I considered every other approach, but we do ultimately need a way of stopping propagation on the native event system for a given event type.",
