  "body": "Hello. I am heavy react user! \r\nI have question when developing it as React.\r\n\r\nAs I develop, sometimes we need to access the elements that exist in the DOM. \r\nIs there any performance difference between using the `DOM Selector` and using `React Ref`?\r\n\r\nFor example, When using Ref, Does Virtual-DOM optimize? Is there a physical speed difference between the DOM selector and ref?\r\n\r\n[The official document](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) does't explan react ref performance.\r\nI'd like to hear your ideas on this.\r\n@gaearon \r\n\r\nThank you :D",
