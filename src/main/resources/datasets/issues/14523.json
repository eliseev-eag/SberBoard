Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/8wxkrynpl\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\ninput onChange to fire even if you attach an event listener to the dom passing a callback function\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI am using React 16.7, I have tested only on chrome since at the company I don't have access to any other browser.\r\n",
