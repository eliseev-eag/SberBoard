  "body": "Hi,\n\nI am trying to analyse the performance of my app. I use Perf.printWasted heavily and face some weird behaviour.\n\nI am usually activating Perf only for a single transition. When doing this for going from one view to another, I get a very long view of Performance waste. I was digging into it and tried to get rid of one single instance:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2970814/8827880/76fa6a6e-308f-11e5-984d-8cddb5753f54.png)\n\nIn the following example I am focusing on Index 1 (\"betround_games >game\") Which supposedly rerenders 27 times without changing the dom.\n\nSince I am using PureRender, I was curious how often the render of betround_games and my game component is triggered. So i added a counter to both components render with the result:\nbetround_games render : 1\ngames render:  9 (for 9 different games)\n\nSo every instance is exactly rendered once. I also saw that sometimes adding new nodes is still counting as wasted time as shown in #1931\n\nThat would explain 9 wasted instances, but does not explain why Perf is counting 27 instances of wasted time.\n\nEither I am understanding the measurement wrong or I make some wrong assumptions.\n",
