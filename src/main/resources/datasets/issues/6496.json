  "body": "There's an item in the v15.0.0 release notes (changelog and blog post) that's super confusing, because I think it's a mistake.\n\n> Functional components can now return null.\n> (@jimfb in #5884)\n\nThis part...\n\n> React 0.14 still allowed you to define a class component without extending React.Component or using React.createClass() [...] This issue is solved in React 15\n\n...implies that you can no longer do this:\n\n``` js\nvar Klass = function () {\n  return {\n    render () { return whatever; }\n  };\n};\n\nrender(<Klass />);\n```\n\nAnd apparently that was the case mistakenly and temporarily from #5884 but fixed in #6008 without being reflected in the changelog.\n\nMy understanding is that the actual change is that you can no longer do `class Hello {}` vs `class Hello extends React.Component {}` (because it wouldn't have `Hello.prototype.isReactComponent`). (Aside: I don't actually fully understand why it works like that, since it seems like you could duck type on `Hello.prototype.render` to differentiate from stateless functional, but I haven't looked at all of it and there must be a reason.)\n\nI've attempted to clarify that in the changelog. (If this is correct it'd also be good to update the blog post if the content is going to be duplicated there.)\n",
