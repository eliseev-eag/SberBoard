  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n**BUG**\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nI am using some SVG tags, especially for customized components from `recharts` library. These customized components tend to fall into this kind of warnings:\r\n\r\n```\r\n Warning: The tag <text> is unrecognized in this browser. If you meant to render a React component, start its name with an uppercase letter.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSame happens for `<g>` tag or `<circle>`.  It would be nice if Jest can recognize it, or at least ignore it \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nRun jest without failing into this warning\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16.8.6\r\nChrome 75.0.3770.100\r\n\r\nI think these 3 tags should be specified in after this line https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/67e3f3fb6e342f95f00215c84d5d013d7b0e1b33/packages/react-dom/src/client/ReactDOMComponent.js#L131\r\n\r\nIf this is a valid issue, and that's the place, I could  have a look to add them and adapt the tests to make it work ðŸ˜„ ",
