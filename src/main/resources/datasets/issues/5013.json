  "body": "Passing `null` indicates that the user tried to specify a value (eg. from the database) but didn't notice the value was null; seems like that should be a warning.  Normally we treat null and undefined as the same, but in this case passing null indicates an error and should therefore be discouraged.  The user should decide if they want an uncontrolled component (in which case they should pass undefined) or if they want an empty controlled component (in which case they should pass the empty string).  \n\n@spicyj said he would be fine with this being a warning and/or with treating null as an empty string.  Making it an error/warning has the advantage that there is now an easy upgrade path (fix the warning) without us introducing subtle changes in behavior that will break people's apps.\n",
