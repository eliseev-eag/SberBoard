  "body": "Some of our older tests worked by counting how many times React checked whether it should yield to the main thread, instead of something publicly observable like how many times a component is rendered.\r\n\r\nOur newer tests have converged on a style where we push into a log and make assertions on the log. This pattern is less coupled to the implementation while still being sufficient to test performance optimizations, like resuming (whenever we add that back).\r\n\r\nThis PR removes `flushDeferredPri` and `flushUnitsOfWork` and upgrades the affected tests.\r\n\r\n## Follow-ups\r\n\r\n- Unify noop and test renderer APIs\r\n  - Replace the generator implementation by having `ReactNoop.yield` push into a global array.\r\n  - Use custom jest matchers to flush and assert on yielded values.\r\n  - Warn if a test attempts to flush work while the log is non-empty.",
