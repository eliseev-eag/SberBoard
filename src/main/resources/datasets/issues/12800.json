  "body": "This was actually done by @trueadm, I just did a minor cleanup on top while he's away from keyboard.\r\n\r\nThe JS version of GCC is already too slow, and **its memory usage is getting worse as we throw more inlinable code at it**. Without this change, we can't land https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12792 (7% prod build size reduction) because it eats over 16GB of RAM and never completes. For comparison, the Java version memory use peaks under 300 MB and completes in a few seconds. Luckily it's nicely packaged under a launcher distributed on npm so it's not a pain to integrate.\r\n\r\nThis change, however, means you can't `yarn build` without Java installed. I can imagine this being annoying for open source contributors. I don't see better options though.",
