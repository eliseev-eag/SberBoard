  "body": "When building some apps, I found out containers plays a major roll in our apps. Of course Relay and Redux make it easy to create them. But for me, there are some other data sources (and caches) which manages the state of our apps.\n\nSo, having a clean and clear way to compose Containers is important for me. That's why I created [react-komposer](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-komposer).\n\nSee: [Letâ€™s Compose Some React Containers](https://voice.kadira.io/let-s-compose-some-react-containers-3b91b6d9b7c8#.qpxo5k2hk)\n\nBasically, with that you could compose from a new kind data source, including promises, Rx.js observables & even Meteor's tracker based data sources.\n\nCheck some demos: https://github.com/kadirahq/react-komposer#using-with-xxx\n\nLooking forward for feedback on this.\n",
