  "body": "I have a couple wrapper components which dynamically calculate the size and position they need to be. Normally this works and performs great with `shouldComponentUpdate`, but as soon as I add children inside these components I can no longer use this method. Why? Because if i return 'false' for the wrapper needing an update... the children never get updated themselves :(\n\nExample JSX:\n\n``` html\n<ReactWrapper>\n  <ChildElement/>\n</ReactWrapper>\n```\n\nIs there any good way around this? Only idea I have is to add a new method shouldUpdateChildren like this other question detailed: https://discuss.reactjs.org/t/shouldcomponentupdate-and-children/2055\n",
