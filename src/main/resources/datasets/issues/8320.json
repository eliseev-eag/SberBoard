  "body": "I would like to propose a small addition to the propTypes.\r\n\r\nI and a few others have encountered issues when using Redux connect to inject information from a store. See:\r\nhttps://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/issues/553\r\n\r\nI was wandering if maybe adding an \".isInjected\" to PropType would make sense? It could work similar to \".isRequired\" where it can be chained to any to any datatype. However, where isRequired validates a value is passed, isInjected validates a value is NOT passed. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\nMyComponent.propTypes = {\r\n  optionalBool: React.PropTypes.bool,\r\n  requiredBool: React.PropTypes.bool.isRequired,\r\n  injectedBool: React.PropTypes.bool.isInjected,\r\n}\r\n\r\nI wanted to vet the idea before bothering with a pull request. \r\n",
