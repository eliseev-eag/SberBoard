  "body": "The fuzzer works by generating a random tree of React elements. The tree two types of custom components:\r\n\r\n- A Text component suspends rendering on initial mount for a fuzzy duration of time. It may update a fuzzy number of times; each update supsends for a fuzzy duration of time.\r\n- A Container component wraps some children. It may remount its children a fuzzy number of times, by updating its key.\r\n\r\nThe tree may also include nested Suspense components.\r\n\r\nAfter this tree is generated, the tester sets a flag to temporarily disable Text components from suspending. The tree is rendered synchronously. The output of this render is the expected output.\r\n\r\nThen the tester flips the flag back to enable suspending. It renders the tree again. This time the Text components will suspend for the amount of time configured by the props. The tester waits until everything has resolved. The resolved output is then compared to the expected output generated in the previous step.\r\n\r\nFinally, we render once more, but this time in concurrent mode. Once again, the resolved output is compared to the expected output.\r\n\r\nI tested by commenting out various parts of the Suspense implementation to see if broke in the expected way. I also confirmed that it would have caught #14133, a recent bug related to deletions.\r\n\r\nThe final commit also includes a fix for a bug the tester found. I can split this into a separate PR.",
