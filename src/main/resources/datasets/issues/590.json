  "body": "When the \"key\" prop of a component changes between render passes, React is expected to unmount the previous instance and mount a new one during reconciliation. However, when said component is the root (i.e. whose DOM parent is the mount point) the same component instance is used.\n\nThis JSFiddle demonstrates how a stateful component with a changing \"key\" is not unmounted when it is the root: http://jsfiddle.net/Yd25R/1/\n",
