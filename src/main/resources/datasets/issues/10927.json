It looked a bit weird before,\r\nimo, when the 'focus' was darker.\r\n\r\nNow the 'focus' style just lightens the border to the new signature\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nWe plan to refactor this page and remove the tabs soon, so not too\r\nworried about making this fix perfect.\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nManual testing - loaded the pages and things look, and ran aXe a11y audit, no\r\nmore warnings about these two issues. :)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1237\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-09-28 at 11 02 03 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1114467/30983056-21b63a0e-a43e-11e7-80f9-eb86151a52d8.png\">\r\n",
