  "body": "_Before_ submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done...\n1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.\n2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!\n3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.\n4. Ensure the test suite passes (`grunt test`).\n5. Make sure your code lints (`grunt lint`) - we've done our best to make sure these rules match our internal linting guidelines.\n6. If you haven't already, complete the [CLA](https://code.facebook.com/cla).\n\nWhen passing an onChange handler as an input prop, you generally want to call the handler with the component bound to `this`. This code snippet is actually broken. `handleChange`'s call to setState will break: `Cannot read property 'setState' of undefined`. \n\nFixed to set `this` properly. Stepping back a level, this flow is _so_ common that I wish there were a more succinct, compact way to get this behavior.\n",
