  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThe method that's used to en-queue a state change is labelled as `setState` -- semantically meaning set the state (implicitly usually wrongly understood as, now).\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nPerhaps, I'm taking a hard stance on semantics, and will probably get some controversy to this as well, but I believe the current method as `setState` should actually **be treated as a bug in the API naming**. I think it should be renamed as `enqueueState`, or `queueState`, or `pushState`, or something on those lines. Perhaps, someone else can come up with a nicer name?\r\n\r\nI've seen even people quite experienced in React to make the rookie mistake now and then, of doing `setState` like it's a synchronous function, and then go bug-hunting. I'm guilty of it as well in deeply nested contexts where its not always obvious. And *now with React Fiber, I think it's all the more important to stay relevant*. \r\n\r\nLet's just bite the bullet, and do a breaking change please. Lifecycle method deprecations are quite of the same magnitude, but it was done - And I for one would think this has to be done. It's not so hard for people to do a Find & Replace - In fact, I'm sure some beginners would even end up fixing some undiscovered errors while doing so, because of a breaking change.  \r\n\r\n**Pros**\r\n- All good things.\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\n- Make some people hold a grudge against me, because they had a function called `queueState` (or whatever) in their application logic and now they painstakingly have to change that too cursing me, rearranging logic.\r\n- Extremely large organisations like Facebook is going to have to spend some time with unmaintained projects. (I'm still not sure if this is a con, because it would make the code expresses itself more clearly for newcomers who would be less prone to mistakes because of it). \r\n- You have to type 2 extra characters (Strike this if you're sane and use auto-complete). \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n<=17 so far. ",
