  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nI am looking to report a bug/clarify if the following is a problem. I upgraded to React v15 and found that web components that rely on <content></content> to embed html elements are not working when used in a React Component.\n\nExample: \n\n```\n<template>\n    <div id='my-wc'>\n        <div id='inner'><content></content></div>\n    </div>\n</template>\n```\n\nUsage in React Component:\n\n```\n<div id='react-parent'>\n    <my-wc><button>Test</button></my-wc>\n</div>\n```\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\n\nThe resulting DOM looks as followings:\n\n```\n<div id='react-parent'>\n     <my-wc>\n          <div id='my-wc'>\n                <div id='inner'></div>\n                <button>Test</button>\n          </div>\n     </my-wc>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe problem is that the button is not getting correctly selected by the web component to be embed in place of `<content></content>`\n\nI had problems getting React and Polymer working in JSFiddle together but I will try and create a demo of the problem and add it on.\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n\nIn React v0.14.\\* the DOM properly rendered and looked like the following:\n\nThe resulting DOM looks as followings:\n\n```\n<div id='react-parent'>\n     <my-wc>\n          <div id='my-wc'>\n                <div id='inner'>\n                    <button>Test</button>\n                </div>\n          </div>\n     </my-wc>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\nThis worked in React v0.14.\\* but does not work as expected in React v15. The same polymer version is used for both versions of React.\n",
