It only catches the \"synchronous\" case (setState directly in useEffect).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1046\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-03-21 at 4 54 45 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/54769901-1784d800-4bfa-11e9-815d-839f1077f343.png\">\r\n\r\nI've made it DEV-only because a crash would be a breaking change. The heuristic might also not be perfect yet and I'd like to give it some time to see if there are edge false positives.",
