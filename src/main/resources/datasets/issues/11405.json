  "body": "Currently (react <=16.0.0) there is no support for `FocusIn/FocusOut` events. But the problem is that in IE  <= 11 blur event has no relatedTarget, so it will be great to support such events.\r\n\r\nSo, the question is will be such support in later versions?\r\nThis problem was mentioned in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3751, but there is no answer.",
