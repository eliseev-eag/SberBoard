This ensures that if passive effect cleanup leads to removing an event handler, it gets removed early enough.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't solve the false positive case in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/15057 (which wasn't caused by an interactive update). However, I realized wrapping it into `ReactDOM.unstable_interactiveUpdates` does so maybe that's the solution for it?",
