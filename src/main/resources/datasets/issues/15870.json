  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nFeature request\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nLet say I spent too much time debugging a very silly bug. I was calling:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, initialState);\r\n\r\ndispatch(MY_CONST);\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead of:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndispatch({ type: CALL_LS });\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the signature of the dispatch function is documented to be something with a `type` inside, I think that a development mode warning message that alert the user about a bad format can help preventing this issue.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nA dev warning message with something like \"_an object with type was expected, received ..._\"\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.8.6",
