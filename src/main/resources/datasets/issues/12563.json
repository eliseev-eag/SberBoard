  "body": "This fixes wrong behavior with composition events when using Korean IME on IE11. (#10217)\r\n\r\nIt seems that it is fine to use native compositionend event from Korean IME, so this simply disable using fallback composition mode when using Korean IME.\r\n\r\nCheck for Korean IME is implemented using `CompositionEvent.locale` property. Although it is deprecated according to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CompositionEvent/locale), it is still available in IE (where fallback composition mode gets enabled) and works well with detecting Korean IME.\r\n\r\nI checked the functionality of this fix manually on IE9, 10, 11, though it seems that fallback composition mode only causes problem in IE11. I think it should have no impact on environments rather than IE with Korean IME.\r\n\r\nIt also fixes other rich text editors depending on React, such as [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n![Before](https://i.imgur.com/IZsYkzz.gif)\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n![After](https://i.imgur.com/m1ewDV6.gif)\r\n",
