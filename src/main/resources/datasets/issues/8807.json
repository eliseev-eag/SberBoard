It seems to be working.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"847\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-01-17 at 00 07 47\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/810438/22003144/23e0f75a-dc49-11e6-8242-b053a123f638.png\">\r\n\r\nI diff trees on every commit to keep the implementation simple but we might hit performance limits with this. I'll be testing performance on Facebook products tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI put the implementation inside React so that DevTools can stop depending on the internal field format. This makes it easier both for us to change the internals (for example, if we later decide to change the strategy), and for libraries like Preact/Infero (hi @trueadm @developit) to integrate with DevTools.\r\n\r\nSome things are intentionally missing:\r\n\r\n- [ ] DOM highlighting\r\n- [ ] Jumping to the React element from Elements node\r\n- [ ] Support for Fiber-specific features like fragments\r\n- [ ] Cleaner data structure API\r\n- [ ] Flow / lint\r\n\r\nI want to come back to them after making sure this approach is viable perf-wise.\r\n\r\nRelated DevTools PR: https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/pull/473. If you want to try it out, build React, check out DevTools at that branch, and copy the built React packages into its `node_modules`. The [plain shell](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/tree/master/shells/plain) is the best for experimenting. If you change anything in React you'll need to recompile [this folder](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/tree/master/test/example) by running `../../node_modules/.bin/webpack` in it.",
