  "body": "In #5714, we changed SVG attribute logic to pass all SVG attributes unchanged.\n\nThis means, for example, that instead of `<svg strokeWidth>` you’d write `<svg stroke-width>`.\nThe reason for this change was that we don’t want to maintain a whitelist of attributes.\n\nSince we released 15 RC, I saw a [report on Twitter](https://twitter.com/albertfdezp/status/707148130307993600) saying that `<svg className>` now also prints a warning:\n\n> Warning: SVG property `className` is deprecated. Use the original attribute name `class` for SVG tags instead.\n\nIn a way, this makes sense, as it is consistent with us not maintaining a whitelist, and with [how we treat custom components](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4933).\n\nOn the other hand, SVG elements do not seem _that_ special, and asking people to use `class` on them instead invites the old discussion about doing that for DOM elements as well.\n\nI would like to double-check that this `className => class` is indeed a change we want to make for SVG elements. Alternatively, we can leave `className` as is by introducing a special case for it alone.\n",
