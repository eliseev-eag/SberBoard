  "body": "https://jsfiddle.net/taylorstine/7o3e6hkd/\r\n\r\nI am building an application that renders a React component on the server and then sends the markup to the client, where the client side React rendering takes over.  I'm wrapping my root component in react hot loader's `<AppContainer/>` component.  The `<AppContainer/>` component uses the new `unstable_handleError()` method to catch errors that occur on the initial mount.  \r\n\r\nLet's say I put some code in my components render method that's guarenteed to throw an error on the client but not on the server, maybe something like: \r\n\r\n```\r\n/**Evil Component**/\r\nrender(){\r\n   if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {\r\n      throw new Error(\"GOTCHA!\")\r\n   }\r\n   return <div>heyyyy</div>\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow, let's say along side that component I have another component that uses a legacy ref.  Something like this\r\n```\r\n/**Happy Component**/\r\nrender(){\r\n   return <div ref=\"this-should-be-cool\">Let me do me</div>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen my client calls `ReactDOM.render()`, the following error is thrown:\r\n```\r\nReact DOM tree root should always have a node reference\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is incorrect.  Note that if I was not using server side rendering, the correct error would be thrown, i.e.\r\n```\r\nGOTCHA\r\n```\r\n\r\nClearly the solution is to not use legacy refs, but is this a bug? Or have string refs been deprecated?\r\n\r\n",
