As react-dom is a dependency you would expect that this would do the trick.\r\nHowever npm sends out warnings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm WARN react-addons-test-utils@15.6.2 requires a peer of react-dom@^15.4.2 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo I really need an older version of react-dom be able to use the test-utils or is it ok to use the latest react-dom version?\r\n\r\nI am using:\r\n- react@^3.7.2\r\n- react-dom@^16.0.0\r\n- react-addons-test-utils@^15.6.2\r\n\r\n",
