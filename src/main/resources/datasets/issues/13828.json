As far as I understand React Fire will drop support for IE11 but even in IE11, you can add or remove classList from elements.\r\n\r\nAnother idea might be adding support for for array type for `className` (or future `class`, which will make more sense because array). If array is passed, `classList` will be used for DOM elements. Otherwise, `className` is used as usual in the real DOM side.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nAll versions. I hope this is added in React Fire.",
