  "body": "## How to safely keep a reference to uncommitted objects and dispose of them on unmount? \r\n\r\nFor a MobX world, we are trying to [prepare for the Concurrent mode](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react-lite/issues/53). In short, there is a [Reaction object being created](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react-lite/blob/231be100e6ba458f40642adb9f0bc77aa4d366ce/src/useObserver.ts#L32\r\n) to track for observables and it is stored within `useRef`.\r\n\r\nThe major problem is, that we can't just `useEffect` to create it in a safe way later. We need it to start tracking the observables on a first render otherwise we might miss some updates and cause inconsistent behavior.\r\n\r\nWe do have a [semi-working solution](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react-lite/pull/121), basically, a custom made garbage collector based on `setTimeout`. However, it's unreliable as it can accidentally dispose of Reactions that are actually being used but weren't committed yet.\r\n\r\nWould love to hear we are overlooking some obvious solution there.",
