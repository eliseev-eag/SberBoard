  "body": "StrictMode throws warnings as errors, making it difficult to debug my own errors due to the amount of console.error spam. If these were logged instead as warnings -- because they are, in fact, _warnings_ -- I would be able to filter my console to more easily isolate messages relevant to my current task. \r\n\r\nWhile I would love to be able to solve these StrictMode warnings in the moment, the reality is that they are filed as Tech Debt at my company, to be resolved at a later time. And I am certain I am not the only one for whom this is the reality of the work day.",
