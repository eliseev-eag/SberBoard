  "body": "I don't know if this would come under feature request or a bug or if this is just expected and things should be handled differently in shouldComponentUpdate.\r\n\r\nCurrent behaviour : If A is a component which renders B and passes C as children to B. Now if A re-renders for some state change of which no part is passed to B or C so basically nothing changes in the subtree of B. B still always re-renders.\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/7utuxyfp/1/\r\n\r\nthis is the fiddle to reproduce this issue. Click on C to make state change in A and B re-renders.\r\n\r\nHere the effect is not much but in some cases children is passed some level deep and can cause un-necessary re-renders.\r\n\r\nthis is in React-16 and previous versions.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/46660619/react-children-rendering-procedure\r\n\r\nthis is a question where some of the observations are posted feel free to answer there only if this is expected or should be handled in a different way. :)",
