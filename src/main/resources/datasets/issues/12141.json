They occasionally get garbage collected, but if you're listening to events that happen a lot (scroll, fast typing, etc) it can slow down and kill the tab you're using.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/80/\r\nOpen dev tools -> performance, check the \"Memory\" checkbox, and start a performance capture. Then type quickly into the text box for a bit. Stop the performance capture and note the increase in event listeners. Picture included for reference.\r\n![screen shot 2018-02-02 at 3 51 56 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3054066/35758393-0fcf8618-0831-11e8-814a-317c82e5d620.png)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nNo memory leaks\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact16, Chrome, MacOS\r\n\r\nLet me know if there's anything I can do to help clarify. Hopefully I got the right wording/info in here. Thanks!",
