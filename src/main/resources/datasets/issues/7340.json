I started running them through imageoptim (v1.6.2b3, default config) and then decided to do that on everythingâ€¦ and that's where we are.\n\nThis might not be worth it since we'll be paying for it in git history size (3x because cherry-picking & built docs), but it's a substantial win for the actual website.\n\n> Saved 3.5MB out of 15.5MB. 36.2% per file on average (up to 87.1%)\n",
