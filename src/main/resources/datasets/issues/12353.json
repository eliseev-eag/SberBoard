See https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12349#issuecomment-372184873.\r\n\r\nUsing `new Map(iterable)` isn't supported in IE11, so it ends up trying to iterate through an empty map and these attributes don't get defined in properties. Since this is only run once on startup inlining the `attributeName` array is probably fine.\r\n",
