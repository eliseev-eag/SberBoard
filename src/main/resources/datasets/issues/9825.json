  "body": "This was mostly used for timing of initial mounts. However, we haven't implemented that in Fiber and yet nobody has complained despite running without it. Further more the update tracks any update within the tree, not just updates to the props of the top level. This is much less useful due to the variation.\r\n\r\nI could make this track initial mounts too but it's a bit awkward so I'd rather just delete it if possible. We can add the full profiler mode if we want more coverage.",
