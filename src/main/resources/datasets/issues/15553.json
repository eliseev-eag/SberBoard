  "body": "In watching the [presentation about building the new facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com/videos/2019/building-the-new-facebookcom-with-react-graphql-and-relay/) I saw a reference to a method called:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nFeature.use()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat was used conditionally, which was confusing because it looked like a hook to me.\r\n\r\nI was actually surprised to find out that React does not consider `Namespace.use()` to be a hook at all, and even `Namespace.useHook()` was not considered a hook by the ESLint plugin because it isn't `React.useHook()`.\r\n\r\nI want to propose two things:\r\n\r\n1. `Namespace.useHook()` should be considered a hook by the ESLint plugin\r\n2. `Namespace.use()` should be considered a hook by React/ESLint plugin\r\n\r\nI've opened this PR with both changes. Although I can easily update it to only include `Namespace.useHook()` if that is preferred.\r\n\r\nBut I would like to argue for also including `Namespace.use()` because the alternative for people wanting to write that is `Namespace.useNamespace()` which is just silly to write.",
