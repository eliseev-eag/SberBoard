  "body": "The new markdown rendering engine does not parse non-plaintext stuff that is within blockquotes well (very prevalent in the community roundup posts). This PR fixes those issues, along with other stuff.\r\n\r\nI also realized the blog images are not rendering properly and an issue has already been filed at https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/2048. Changing the `<img src=\"...\">` to `![alt](src)` syntax works for fixing most of those image issues. I'm not sure whether we should wait for this issue to be fixed in Gatsby or we can just change the syntax to the working version first. Let me know if the latter is preferred and I can submit a PR for that.",
