  "body": "Apologies for the none-standard git issue, but I wasn't quite sure where else to ask. \r\n\r\nI'm working with another developer on a React project, using ES6. So I was just wondering, is there anything wrong or bad practice about using fat arrow functions hoisted, and parameters hoisted to a component class, which aren't set within the constructor? So for example... \r\n\r\n```\r\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  state = {\r\n    name: '',\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  setName = (e) => {\r\n    this.setState({ name: e.target.value })\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy colleagues approach...\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props)\r\n    this.state = {\r\n      name: '',\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    this.setName = this.setName.bind(this)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  setName(e) {\r\n    this.setState({ name: e.target.value })\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason I use approach 1 is because it automatically scopes `this` within the function, so you don't need to write the additional line to bind a method within the constructor.\r\n\r\nI figured ultimately this was down to preference as they both worth identically. But I've been told my way (first example) was bad practice. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance! ",
