  "body": "With the checkin of #10362, the code to render to a stream now looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { renderToStream } from 'react-dom/server'\r\n\r\nrenderToStream(<div>some text</div>).pipe(response);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is great! I am, however, a little concerned about taking the word \"node\" out of the mix, because I'm thinking that we may eventually want to render to [**browser** streams](https://www.w3.org/TR/streams-api/), which are a really neat feature that can be used in concert with \"service-worker-side rendering\". I would propose renaming `renderToStream` to `renderToNodeStream` and `renderToStaticStream` to `renderToStaticNodeStream`.  This would give room for `renderToBrowserStream` in the future.\r\n\r\nIf I make a PR on this, would it have a chance of being accepted? \r\n\r\ncc @gaearon & @sebmarkbage ",
