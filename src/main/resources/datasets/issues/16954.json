  "body": "I'm [integrating Suspense with React Async](https://github.com/async-library/react-async/pull/153), and I've been reading up on how it's supposed to work. All the resources I found talk about needing `react-cache` or another cache mechanism for Suspense to work properly. However, none of the resources explain WHY Suspense needs a cache. Could someone explain that? I've been able to [make it work without a cache](https://github.com/async-library/react-async/pull/153/files#diff-2d8d9c51cb93c9f7f57c81f6f7f1669a). Am I missing something?",
