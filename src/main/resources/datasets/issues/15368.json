  "body": "I`m trying to render a component in a React router route using a switch to switch between two path in the APP and I get the following error:\r\n\r\nreact-dom.development.js:57 Uncaught Invariant Violation: Home(...): Nothing was returned from the render. This usually means a return statement is missing. Or, to render nothing, return null.\r\nat invariant (web pack-internal:///./node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:57:19)\r\n\r\nBut I can see that the component is loading so therefore it should not be null (I can see console logs in the console from that component)\r\nI`m trying to do so using this code:\r\n`<Switch> <Route exact path ='/' render = {(props) => <Home {...props} toggleFilter={this.state.filterDrawerOpen}/>}/> <Route path='/profile' component ={Profile}/> </Switch>`\r\n\r\n",
