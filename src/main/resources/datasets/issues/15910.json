  "body": "As I prepare to implement integrated timers, I noticed some peculiarities in the Scheduler implementation that could afford to be cleaned up.\r\n\r\nThis is a refactor and shouldn't affect any observable behavior (except maybe accidental bugs); mostly it removes some concepts that existed in earlier iterations of Scheduler and are no longer needed.\r\n\r\nThe main change is to how the DOM implementation schedules an additional callback before yielding to the main thread. It used to follow the same code path for scheduling task; now it has its own branch directly inside the message event handler. The special case for error handling — where we call `postMessage` immediately without waiting for rAF — has similarly been localized inside the catch block of the message event handler.\r\n\r\nIt probably helps to read the commits one at a time.",
