  "body": "Probably not a bug but a very unpleasant change for many\n\nWhen passing props to root components i.e. div's, a's etc, if it is an unknown prop there is now a large stack trace displayed. For those of us using cljs libs such as om/reagent, we frequently leverage passing props around with &args and (into :div ...) quite a bit to write components that can take open ended markup/content. It would be very painful to go back and refactor many of our components to not do this, and as it is now with 15.2+ we have to deal with massive amounts of obnoxious stack traces that make development extremely unpleasant. \n\n![screen shot 2016-08-08 at 2 15 57 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2801653/17495155/28096928-5d75-11e6-9679-9c921cb657ea.png)\n\nNot to show warnings\n\n15.1 and prior did not display this behavior\n",
