  "body": "Without thinking much about the semantics of what I was doing, I had\n\n```\nrender: function() {\n  return (\n    <p><h1>Hello</h1></p>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nWhich had all sorts of odd effects on my application, where seemingly random UI components just went missing. Presumably this is because the < p > and < h1 > combination isn't valid like this, and my markup was just plain bad.\n\nI got no error message from React, nothing from the browser, and the application misbehaviour seemed mostly random to me.\n\nI don't really expect react to \"fix this\" for me, but I wanted to post this here, as my own googling lead me nowhere, and it would have been nice to understand WHY things were exploding.\n",
