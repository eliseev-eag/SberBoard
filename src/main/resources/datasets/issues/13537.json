  "body": "Fixes #11423\r\n\r\nFirst PR, CLA is signed.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR `<noscript><img src=\"...\" /></noscript>` would:\r\n\r\n* Warn about a server/client mismatch\r\n* Download the img\r\n* (Run any lifecycles for components inside the noscript)\r\n\r\nI tried fixing this by only touching ReactDOM and found that by treating `<noscript>` as an element that only supports text it achieved the desired effects. This also keeps the markup in the DOM on the client which is desirable as per the issue.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\n* Is this a hacky way to do it? In a sense `shouldSetTextContent` is true for noscript-elements on the client, but could it have any unintended side-effects now or in the future?\r\n* Solving it this way means that the content inside a noscript could still be updated on the client as long as children is a string, is the desirable or confusing?\r\n* Is the test a sane and robust way to test for this?",
