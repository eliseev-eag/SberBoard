  "body": "This is the last (ðŸŽ‰ðŸ˜¢) of my planned SSR unit test PRs (following on #9055, #9089, #9106, #9221, and #9257). It tests form fields: `<input type=text>`, `<input type=checkbox>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>`.\r\n\r\nThe first set of tests makes sure that the server renderer correctly maps React properties for each of those fields to correct DOM properties (or for `textarea`, to inner text). It also makes sure that the renderer warns when a value is set without onChange or readOnly.\r\n\r\nThe latter tests attempt to make sure that form fields that have been server rendered work correctly with user interaction, whether they are controlled or uncontrolled and whether the user interaction happens before client render or after.\r\n\r\nI also deleted a duplicative unrelated test that @spicyj mentioned in a review comment on #9257.\r\n\r\nThis set of tests are more verbose and a little more complex than some of the others; I welcome any feedback to make them more readable. Thanks!",
