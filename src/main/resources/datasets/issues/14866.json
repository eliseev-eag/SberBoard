Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nDemo here:\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/v380wrp205\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nNote the console.log on line 6 in the demo. The behavior I expected would be a maximum of two logs:\r\n\r\nre-rendered 0\r\nre-rendered 1\r\n\r\nThe first log is for the initial render and the second log is for the re-render when the button is clicked. Any additional clicks would be ignored because it bails out of updates if the value between renders are the same (according to https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#bailing-out-of-a-state-update).\r\n\r\nHere is the actual behavior:\r\n\r\nre-rendered 0\r\nre-rendered 1\r\nre-rendered 1\r\n\r\nClicking the button again after the first click causes another re-render, but why? The value hasn't changed since the previous render.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16.8",
