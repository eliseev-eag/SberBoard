  "body": "When using `-w` and `-x jsx` it will recompile the source when the output is generated. It appears that this is because the matching is not strict enough.\n\nAssume the directory structure of:\n\n```\njsx-test\n  \\src\n    source.jsx\n  \\build\n```\n\nFrom within `jsx-test/` run `jsx -wx jsx src build`. It should build once.\nIn another terminal, open up `source.jsx` and make some modifications.\nSwitch back to the previous terminal and you'll see that when the `source.jsx.swp` gets updated it will rebuild the source again.\n",
