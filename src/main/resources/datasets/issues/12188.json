Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nThe deprecated `componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps)` used to allow code like `this.props.foo !== nextProps.foo`. With the new `getDerivedStateFromProps` function, there's no choice (because it is a static method) but to constantly copy `nextProps.foo` into state in order to access it later.\r\n\r\nThis is illustrated in the example posted to twitter by @gaearon: https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/953612246634188800?lang=en\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIdeally (if it's not difficult to implement!) the `getDerivedStateFromProps` would also take the current (previous/old) props as an argument, something like:\r\n\r\n`getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, prevState, prevProps)`\r\n\r\nThis would eliminate the need to constantly assign props to state purely for comparison purposes...\r\n\r\nA quick look at the source doesn't make it clear to me how easy this would be though...\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/4a20ff26ecfe9bc66941d79f7fce2c67be8ee236/packages/react-dom/src/server/ReactPartialRenderer.js#L456\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.3.0",
