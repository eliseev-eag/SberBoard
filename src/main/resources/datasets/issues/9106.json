  "body": "This PR is a continuation of my port of SSR unit tests into master. There are two parts to this PR:\r\n\r\n1. A bunch of test for the mapping of props to HTML attributes.\r\n1. Small fixes to some bugs in the actual test framework, including \r\n    1. a reset of modules in between server and client render to reset dev errors, and \r\n    1. testing to make sure that the client render didn't blow away the server-rendered DOM elements.\r\n\r\nAs always, any feedback is welcome. Thanks!",
