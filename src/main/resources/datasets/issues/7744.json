  "body": "Currently, React treats all `aria-*` props as custom props. There are 46 ARIA attributes; we can easily enumerate all of them and verify that an `aria-*` prop on an element exists in the spec.\n\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#states_and_properties\n\nI've included the list of props from the upcoming ARIA 1.1 Working Draft. I work with one of the editors of this specification. It's currently taken about 3 years to update from 1.0 to 1.1. We should not expect any churn in this list of props in the short- or mid-term future.\n",
