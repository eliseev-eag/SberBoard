  "body": "Hi! ðŸ˜„ \r\n\r\nThis is my first contribution that actually changes runtime behaviour, and involved some guesswork as to _where_ to make _what_ change to get the desired effect - so do take it with a grain of salt. I'm super willing to learn more about how React is written and fix anything that needs to be fixed in this PR, if the functionality is welcome.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new DEV-mode warning when the value `\"false\"` (case-insensitive) is found in a DOM prop of type `BOOLEAN`, recommending the use of the boolean value `false` instead.\r\n\r\nWhile working on https://github.com/facebook/flow/pull/6727 I came across [the different types of boolean DOM props](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/725e499cfb4da60da46aa5b44c4bad29cad3d08f/packages/react-dom/src/shared/DOMProperty.js#L22-L37), and specifically the fact that `BOOLEAN` props (e.g. `hidden`) treat the string `\"false\"` as equivalent to boolean _`true`_, whereas `BOOLEANISH_STRING` props (e.g. `spellCheck`) treat it as equivalent to boolean `false` - an inconsistency that follows from the HTML spec, but one that can conceivably trip up developers, hence a warning.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure what `OVERLOADED_BOOLEAN` props should do about `\"false\"` - currently the warning doesn't apply to them.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Per feedback below, this now also warns on `\"true\"`, and only warns on case-sensitive (lowercase) matches.",
