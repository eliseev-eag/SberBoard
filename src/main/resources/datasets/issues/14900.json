I found that with the Fabric renderer the first argument to setNativeProps was `undefined`.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure we will be changing this later as Fabric won't be calling `UIManager.updateView` at all but this can at least be changed for now.\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/72",
