  "body": "We're blocked on a few things here. Current JSHint is incompatible with what we do with template strings. I have a PR up there to mostly fix it but I bet there are more things. So even after that I think we'll want to switch to using ESLint. However that has its own set of problems as it is still working on ES6/JSX support (mostly blocked on other libraries at this point it seems). I have a PR (#2662) up to start using eslint, but there are a few rules disabled (because of incompatibilities on their end) which are really important and enabling them is a blocker for this.\n- [x] Use eslint (#2662)\n- [x] Enable all appropriate rules\n- [ ] Add custom rules (namely, `invariant` must use string literals for 2nd argument)\n",
