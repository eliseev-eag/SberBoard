  "body": "In https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7359 I added a loose check before assigning the `value` attribute on all controlled inputs. This was originally addedÂ to account for some edge cases in Chrome/Safari when working on number inputs (see the discussion). However, at some point I added a specific check for number inputs and never removed this check for other input types. \r\n\r\nSo that created an issue: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9561\r\n\r\nThis commit removes that loose check, adds tests for the associated cases, and updates old tests to be in line with the new expectation.  I also added a new DOM test fixture and updated the input DOM fixtures to use the new format we're using in other tests.\r\n\r\n**Test page:**\r\n\r\nhttp://nh-controlled-text-input-numbers.surge.sh/text-inputs\r\n\r\n**Related issues:**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9561\r\n\r\n",
