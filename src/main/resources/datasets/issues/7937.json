  "body": "`todos` is an array, `v` is React.createElement, and I render: (It's not in jsx, but you'll understand)\n\n``` js\ntodos.map((todo,i)=>\n    v('li', {/*...*/},\n        v(TodoItem, {\n            text: todo.text,\n            update: text=>console.log('update',i)||this.updateTodo(i,{text}) // (*)\n        })\n    )\n)\n```\n\nTodoItems can be [dragged](https://github.com/caub/todo-list/blob/gh-pages/TodoList.js#L67-L85), and their text is updated [onBlur](https://github.com/caub/todo-list/blob/gh-pages/TodoItem.js#L37) (so just clicking anywhere outside the current text)\n\nI was surprised I get [this issue (gif)](https://github.com/caub/todo-list/blob/f5ca6f6157c3355eff69b33a9e7bf68ade50a204/propsfunctionissue.gif). The passed arrow functions `text=>this.updateTodo(i,{text})` are not updated after a new render call, so the i that should be 2 at the end of the gif, is still 0.\n\nI should observe in logs:\n\n```\nupdate 0\nupdate 1\nupdate 2\nupdate 2 // with the first item that got dragged in last position\n```\n\nMaybe it's like that since forever, but it's surprising and not too intuitive, it's maybe an optimization that you did?\n\ndemo with the issue: https://caub.github.io/todo-list/ \n\n**edit**: having `key = {i}` instead of `key = {todo.id}` would fix this issue, but it breaks the CSS transitions\n",
