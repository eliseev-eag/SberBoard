  "body": "This fixes two parts of the markup generation to be XML-compatible per #2278 (specifically, self-closing tags and boolean attributes). More work is necessary to output valid Polyglot HTML5, as well as generic XML (for things like DocBook, etc). However, this should let React generate valid XML for the lion's share of use cases.\n\nThis breaks tests that are (incorrectly) checking for invalid XML, but these changes are nonetheless still valid HTML5. Advice is requested on if I should 'fix' the tests. Thanks!\n",
