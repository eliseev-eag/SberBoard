  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nThis is an accessibility issue with the new documentation website.\r\n\r\nIt's a clear-cut problem, but the solution is pretty open ended and ill defined. Might be difficult, and could use some design creativity.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWe are using [Prism.js](http://prismjs.com/) for the syntax highlighting styles of our code snippets. We also sometimes want to \"highlight\" a certain line, so we lighten the background of that line. With the lighter background, many of the font colors don't provide enough contrast.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/ebsrpraL/).**\r\n\r\nYou can verify this by [running the aXe a11y audit](https://www.deque.com/products/axe/) on this page: https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nWe need a way to highlight a line without losing so much contrast.\r\n\r\nBUT choosing a different hue without making it lighter looks bad in my opinion, and I would rather not fiddle with the various font colors used in the syntax highlighting.\r\n\r\nWe should either collaborate with the Prism project to add a 'highlight' option with enough contrast, or find another library/system to use for syntax highlighting.\r\n",
