  "body": "This fixes #16938 but isn't actually the semantics we want for this case.\r\n\r\nAs described in: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16938#issuecomment-536207871\r\n\r\nThis would silently try to hydrate bad mismatches instead of gracefully regenerate the content on the client. Additionally, the only time the hack makes sense is if you can guarantee that nothing will possibly suspend during hydration. If it does, it opens up a whole new set of issues as the fallback would now try to hydrate.\r\n\r\nSo it's clear to me that we don't actually want this to be the semantics.\r\n\r\nNow the debate is in whether it's ok to change this in a minor. We'd argue that it is because conditional rendering on the server is never considered a public API. E.g. if you conditionally render useLayoutEffect, Context providers or anything else, that's also not a legit usage. So technically we don't consider this a breaking change. Suspense was already erroring if used as intended - unconditionally.\r\n\r\nHowever this is a technicality and it's really about what is the impact of this in practice.",
