  "body": "This PR most probably isn't ready, it's rather intended to fix (or at least highlight the problems of) https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11379. The problem is that `mouseDown` never gets reset after the drop event, since this plugin never receives `topMouseUp` as `topLevelType` when dropping. \r\n\r\nWhat I did here fixes the problem, but I feel like the proper solution would be to make sure that the `topMouseUp` event is received.\r\n",
