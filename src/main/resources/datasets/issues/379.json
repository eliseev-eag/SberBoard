  "body": "I really like our `ReactLayersMixin` plugin and we should open source it. It allows us to implement not just the `render` function, but also the `renderLayers` function. The `render` is the same as its always been (describe your structure at _any_ point in time. The `renderLayers` API allows you to describe your modal _layers_ at _any_ point in time. So that means you can open and close layers as a function of `props`/`state` just like your `render()` function can \"react\" to `props`/`state`.\n\nAssigning to @yungsters who mastered the React/Layers stuff on FB's stack, but @petehunt also has great experience using and building out layers integration with React. So whoever has time/need.\n",
