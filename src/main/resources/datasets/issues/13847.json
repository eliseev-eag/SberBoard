  "body": "I don't know if this is a bug but this behavior seems weird.\r\n\r\nThe sequence is:\r\n\r\n* Perform update 1\r\n* Schedule update 2\r\n* Start rendering update 2\r\n* Advance time so that update 2 is expired\r\n* Schedule update 3\r\n* Flush expired work\r\n\r\nMy expectation is this should only flush update 2 (it's the one that expired). Update 3 hasn't expired yet.\r\n\r\nHowever, this flushes update 3 instead. If I revert https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13503, this flushes both 2 and 3. I can't get it to only flush 2, but that seems like the desired behavior.\r\n\r\nBy itself flushing 3 isn't that bad. The real situation I was trying to reproduce is when we expire another update *while* rendering a just-expired update, and that kicks off another rendering cycle without yielding. But I couldn't get to reproducing that because even a more basic scenario above didn't work as I expected.",
