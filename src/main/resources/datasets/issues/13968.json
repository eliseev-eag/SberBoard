This pull request implements all proposed built-in Hooks behind a feature flag, both for the client and the server renderer.\r\n\r\nThis is a very early time for Hooks and this proposal is experimental. We're merging it into master now so we can iterate on it. It is **turned on only in the 16.7 alpha** release so that you can try it and provide your feedback.\r\n\r\nWe have been using this code for a month in production so while the APIs are not stable, we don't expect the implementation to contain major bugs.\r\n\r\n**Please keep the feedback and discussion contained [in the Hooks RFC](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/68) (and _not_ in this PR) so that everyone can discuss it in a single place without checking multiple GitHub threads.**\r\n\r\n",
