Here is a fiddle example of the issue - [https://jsfiddle.net/w77wsgno/](https://jsfiddle.net/w77wsgno/)\n\nIn chrome it selects the first option with the value \"NO\". Testing on iPhone it selects the last option with the value \"NO\". \n\nIs there a solution to this being consistent and always selecting the first option with the \"NO\" value?\n",
