  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nfeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nForm component has \"form field\" children (Input(), Checkbox(), etc) that are validated against some custom rules when form is submitted. Validation works fine.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n If the form is invalid, I would like to scroll the page to the first invalid element after the form is submitted but unfortunately components do not expose the underlying DOM three (except via the Fiber object) and I cannot get the \"ref\" of any component, which makes scrolling not possible since I don't have the DOM reference.\r\n\r\nI am trying to avoid ref forwarding on \"form field\" components because I would like the Form to handle all validation related code (for encapsulation purposes and in case I want to publish this as a library, for instance).\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nreact: \"^16.4.0\"\r\n\r\nIs there any way to achieve this?\r\n",
