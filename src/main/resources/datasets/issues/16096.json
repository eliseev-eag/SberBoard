This means we can't statically verify whether you've passed the correct dependencies.eslint(react-hooks/exhaustive-deps)\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  const memoPosition = React.useMemo(\r\n    () => position && gpsToLatLng(position),\r\n    [position],\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI am not sure if there is a better pattern to tackle that use case. The `position` can be null and I am fine with `memoPosition` to becoming `null` as well. However, since I cannot call the hook conditionally \r\n\r\nNote, I am not memoizing because the computation would be heavy, but because the value is passed further down and would cause re-render of a much bigger tree when a position has not actually changed. The consuming component is 3rd party and it has default `React.memo` applied.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n```\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Windows 10\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 10.16.0 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.EXE\r\n    Yarn: 1.16.0 - C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Yarn\\bin\\yarn.CMD\r\n    npm: 6.9.0 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: 16.9.0-alpha.0 => 16.9.0-alpha.0\r\n    react-dom: 16.9.0-alpha.0 => 16.9.0-alpha.0\r\n    react-scripts: ^3.0.1 => 3.0.1 (not ejected)\r\n```",
