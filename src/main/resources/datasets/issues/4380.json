  "body": "Hello party people,\n\nI'd like to find dom nodes by attributes (specifically aria-selected). Use case is testing keyboard navigation around dom nodes to ensure my component is accessible.\n\nAny thoughts on this? I try to avoid refs as much as possible and classes aren't specific enough to the state of the element. \n\nAny thoughts? If I made a commit would it be accepted?\n\nThanks! \n",
