  "body": "We were previously using the `shallowEqual` method from the react/lib implementation, which was used in the following way:\n\n```\n  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {\n    return !shallowEqual(this.props, nextProps) || !shallowEqual(this.state, nextState);\n  }\n```\n\nWhen updating to 0.14, we migrated to using the npm package for 'react-addons-shallow-compare'.\nWe assumed shallowCompare worked the same way, but anything we passed to shallowCompare was returning true\n\n```\n  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {\n    return !shallowCompare(this.props, nextProps) || !shallowCompare(this.state, nextState);\n  }\n```\n\nAfter doing some low level testing, even the following was returning true:\n\n```\nshallowCompare({value: true}, {value: false});\n```\n\nUsing the Chrome dev tools I was able to discover the method signature that was expected:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6892184/10912226/16f73f9a-820e-11e5-8408-9e34721b668d.png)\n\nI think we need to better document this method somewhere, either in the npm package page (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-addons-shallow-compare) or on the addons page (https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/addons.html) to help out others wanting to make this transition.\n",
