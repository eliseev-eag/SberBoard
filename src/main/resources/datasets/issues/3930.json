  "body": "I've been extending out my [current project](https://github.com/Wildhoney/Maple.js) for webcomponents in React, and I noticed that the [`is` attribute](http://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/#type-extension-semantics) isn't supported for React, and is therefore pruned from the element.\n\nI can't be entirely sure this isn't intentional, but I thought I'd open a PR nonetheless. I think it definitely should be in the framework. If not, it would be nice to know what the rationale behind its exclusion is/was.\n",
