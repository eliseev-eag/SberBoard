  "body": "I don't think my explanation is great for a tutorial since it doesn't really introduce the concept of reordering or clobbering, but keying your dynamic children seems necessary to avoid warnings and sounds like its generally recommended.  Therefore, it seems like this is the appropriate place to introduce this concept.\n\nBesides improving the explanation for this to make a little more introductory, it seems like this should be added to the tutorial.  If the maintainers agree, should I update any other example files?\n",
