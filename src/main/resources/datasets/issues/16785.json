Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React:**\r\n\r\n**CodeSandbox:** (https://codesandbox.io/s/react-custom-hooks-nkcn6)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nexpected behavior is to receive same updates on all child components.\r\n\r\n**Note** : I'm not looking for a solution because i already found mine, (using the custom hook on the parent container and pass props to child components). \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact Version : 16.8\r\n",
