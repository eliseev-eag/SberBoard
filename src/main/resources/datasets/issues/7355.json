  "body": "This is a bug that can be reproduced in IE10 and 11. \n\nThe UI will become unresponsive after the first update of the `<use>` element.\n\nVisit http://codepen.io/stream7/pen/bZKVGW and click/toggle the button. It works fine in Chrome/Firefox but in IE the browser becomes unresponsive after the first click. There is no error thrown. \n\nI was able to reproduce it in all 15.x.x versions and in 0.14.8 on Windows 7 IE10-11 (modern.ie editions)\n",
