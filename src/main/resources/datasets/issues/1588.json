  "body": "Imho it would be useful to be able to define `propTypes` per `Mixin`. I.e.: sometimes the Mixin-code may rely on methods defined on the `Component` that mixes-in the `Mixin`. \n\nIn such a case it would make sense to combine/mixin `propTypes` as defined on the `Component` with `propTypes` of each of the included `Mixins`. \n\nWhat do you think? \n",
