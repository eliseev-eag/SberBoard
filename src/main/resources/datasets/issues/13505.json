  "body": "The documentation states\r\n> This method exists for rare use cases where the state depends on changes in props over time\r\n\r\nHowever, having read through https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12188, it appears the only way to achieve this (checking props against prevProps to respond to a change) is by copying props into state - which appears to directly contradict [your article on derived state anti patterns](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html).\r\n\r\nTo say the least I'm a bit confused - should the documentation be changed (and `getDerivedStateFromProps` should not be used for responding to changes in props), or should I go ahead with the anti-pattern approach of copying props to state (pls no)? Or is there something I am missing?\r\n\r\nTIA",
