  "body": "Hi, I really like new dev tools (4.0.5), but I would like to request one useful feature.\r\n\r\nIn previous version it was possible to save inspected value (prop/state/context) and its parts as a global variable using context menu->store as global variable, so it can be easily be accessed through console using `$tmp{n}`. In current version this is behaviour was replaced be creating new \"bug\" button which will just print all values in console. Unfortunately it's hard to navigate through this object, because $_ in console will return undefined. And in order to access it you need to expand group, find desired property and open context menu->store as global variable. \r\nIt would be perfect if you combine these 2 approaches so it would be possible to both print values using \"bug\" button and opening context menu directly in react dev tools panel wihtout need of intermediate step. \r\n\r\nThanks! \r\n\r\n",
