  "body": "Previously, `renderIntoDocument` relied on the synchronous return value of render.  As per https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6397, we want to start moving away from relying on this synchronous return value.  This PR takes the first step toward that goal, by providing a `renderIntoDocumentAsync` method, which makes it easy to render into a document and wait on the return value for the purposes of unit testing.  Long term, the `renderIntoDocumentAsync` is intended to replace `renderIntoDocument` for all intents and purposes.\n\nThe primary motivation for this PR is that it brings our unit tests closer to matching the semantics of an incremental reconciler, thereby allowing us to iterate on our incremental reconciler without failing all the unit tests.\n\ncc @sebmarkbage @spicyj @zpao \n",
