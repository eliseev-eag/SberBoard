  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nIt can be seen as a feature or a bug, depending on angle. Let's say it's an enhancement to how `lazy` works.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen using `React.lazy`, if the given promise rejects while trying to asynchronously load a component, it's no longer possible to retry loading the component chunk because `lazy` internally caches the promise rejection.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nThis does not seem to work great in CodeSandbox because it's using service workers, which get in the way when simulating offline mode, yet this small app illustrates the issue: https://codesandbox.io/s/v8921j642l\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nA promise rejection should not be cached by `lazy` and another attempt to render the component should call the function again, giving it the chance to return a new promise.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nAFAIK all version of React that include `lazy`.\r\n",
