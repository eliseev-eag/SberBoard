  "body": "I'm going to close this out regardless, but I wanted to get some feedback on the idea before I went all the way. I've been wanting to split out JSX since â€¦ forever. This finally does it but keeps it as the `react-tools` package. (ok, it's not actually moved out here, but it shows what would get moved out).\n\nI think what we could do to make sure the React repo doesn't fall out of sync is to set the dependency to the react-tools repo (presumably reactjs/react-tools). We could also then iterate in react-tools and release changes without necessarily staying strictly in sync like we do now.\n\nI `npm link`ed and jest works, as does (at least) `grunt build:basic`. The JSXTransformer build might be broken and it's also not clear where that would live (maybe it could be rebranded to ReactTools.js?)\n",
