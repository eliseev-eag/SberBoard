  "body": "Good day, honest fellows! I'm fairly new to react and single page apps, and I really can't wrap my head around something here.\r\n\r\nIn the [server routing](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#serving-apps-with-client-side-routing) section in `README.md` of `create react app` it is stated that we just send the index.html again and again despite accessing different routes. \r\n\r\nI guess it is ok to send this file again and again since it is almost empty and we usually only have div tag with `id=\"app\"` os something.\r\n\r\nAnd so that way react is injecting html that being sent from the server already on the client side right? And building different html file of sorts. And client-side routing is being handled with no caveats either. \r\n\r\nSo my questions are, sorry there's a lot of them: \r\n- What's the difference in client/server side react rendering? What's server side react rendering even is? Why would one want it?\r\n- How to do client-side routing with it? That's a major one.\r\n- How then client accesses the data? Via api on different route? And for instance Redux reducers would do that kind of work, right?\r\n\r\nHelp me to understand this please.",
