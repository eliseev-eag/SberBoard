  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nI assume this is a bug.\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen I register an `onClickCapture` event handler, click on the element and then inspect the event the `eventPhase` property is set to `3` which is equivalent to `Event.BUBBLING_PHASE`. \r\n\r\nI'm currently rewriting the `ReactTreeTraversal` tests to use the public API, that's how I found the problem.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.**\r\n[![Edit 6wrk742jp3](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/6wrk742jp3)\r\nOn codesandbox I would expect an alert `false` and then `true` but it is the other way round.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe `eventPhase` property should be set to `Event.CAPTURING_PHASE` / `1`.\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nI haven't tried this in versions different from 16.1.1, all testing was done in Chrome 62.",
