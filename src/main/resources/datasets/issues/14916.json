But then it's niche enough that it's hard to come up with a name that makes sense. And when it fires, the exhaustive deps warning becomes confusing. So I decided to make this mistake \"cancel out\" the exhaustive deps warning until you clarify the intent.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"701\" alt=\"screen shot 2019-02-21 at 5 16 52 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/53188263-e4502880-35fc-11e9-9e27-123deb1ce677.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nI plan to add a few more \"niche\" cases into this rule.
