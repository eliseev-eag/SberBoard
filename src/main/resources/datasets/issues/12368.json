  "body": "I'm testing running React through Closure optimizations (with ClojureScript), and I've hit problem where e.g. `children` property gets included in output when using `renderToString/staticMarkup`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<p children=\"foo, ,bar,,1\">foo bar1</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\n(the way children value is converted to string could be due to Cljs).\r\n\r\nThis is due to Google Closure removes all the properties from the `RESERVED_PROPS` objects, as they aren't statically accessed.\r\n\r\n@banga already has fix for ReactElement  in #11967 /  #11995:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11967/commits/7d50185b83e679aacff248dcf071eeefb8ce0219\r\n\r\nBut React-dom server has another place with the same problem:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/ad9544f48e58f2599a8ea0de1e9f4dd104db30bb/packages/react-dom/src/server/ReactPartialRenderer.js#L312-L317\r\n\r\nUnfortunately looks like this isn't fixable by externs or other means by user, so it would be nice to have this fixed here.\r\n\r\n(Mostly React already works with Closure optimizations in Cljs, but my test-suite uses `renderToStaticMarkup`.)",
