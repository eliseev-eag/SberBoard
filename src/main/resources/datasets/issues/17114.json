Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n* It should behave as normal anchor tag and scroll to its relevant id.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n * It all works fine only for Google Chrome Browser Desktop version and Chrome for Androind. It won't work for Mozila, Safari, etc. for mobile and desktop. Also does not work for any browser on IOS.",
