  "body": "This PR builds on @tomocchino & @sebmarkbage's work on the server renderer in React 16, exposing the server renderer as a Node.js Readable Stream. This allows folks to pipe a renderer out to the network, and it's a fairly common request of folks using SSR.\r\n\r\nThe actual code part of it is pretty small, as the existing `read()` method of the server renderer in React 16 is already able to do partial/async rendering; all we needed to do was wrap that `read()` method in a Readable stream, which is pretty much all in src/renderers/shared/server/ReactDOMNodeStreamRenderer.js. The rest of the PR is code organization, build, test, and documentation changes.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely comfortable with the build changes, especially the changes in bundles.js, as I don't really know what things like `fbEntry` and `hasteName` mean. Names in general were a bit sticky, and I settled on `ReactDOMNodeStream`/`react-dom/node-stream` for the new object, mindful that it's possible that a renderer for web streams might be created in the future. I have some other ideas about naming after talking with @tomocchino, but I'll save those for another PR.\r\n\r\nThanks so much for all the work y'all do!\r\n\r\nETA: I should also give props to @spicyj, who I believe wrote an earlier version of the server renderer on top of which Tom and Sebastian built their work. Thanks, @spicyj!",
