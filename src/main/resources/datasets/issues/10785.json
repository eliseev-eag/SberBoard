  "body": "Context:\r\nCurrently, we are using Prettier 1.2.2, which was released in 2017-04-19. Since then, many more minor versions have been released, and there unfortunately seems to be some breaking changes with some external productivity libraries. For example, https://github.com/prettier/prettier-atom/issues/268 :'(\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I upgraded prettier to 1.7.0 and ran `yarn` and `yarn prettier`. Next, I built React and fixed the broken tests.",
