  "body": "Hi there !\r\n\r\nI'm writting here because I use 'refs' to pilot my tests and I would love to be able to uniformise my tests. Right now, with this PR https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/pull/672#issuecomment-259870776, I can achieve that pretty well with string refs.\r\n\r\nSince string refs are considered legacy, and since there still seems to be problems with refs (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3234), I was wondering, what is the plan concerning refs.\r\n\r\nMoreover, would it be possible to support them in shallow rendering ? I looked into it and I think it'll be possible if we return the `_instance` as with mount of the given element instead of the `_renderedComponent`. I'm aware it's a breaking change but if we can make\r\n\r\nSo, I'd like to understand the plan and/or the logic behind returning `_renderedComponent`. Maybe I could help. Oh and since I'm on it, if it's not to much trouble, I'd be interested in the reason why changing from string refs to callback refs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help !",
