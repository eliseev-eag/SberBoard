  "body": "Is there any work going on to make React a bit more modular?\nBefore you laugh it off, I'm not suggesting React should be based on thousands of \"micro-libs\" :)\n\nSome things I never used, or don't have a need for:\n- Server side rendering -> Only use React in non SEO critical projects; Also absolutely not convinced about so-called performance benefits as we don't use node to begin with.\n- Support for older browsers -> This is a fast moving target; More and more people drop support for IE < 10-11 completely nowadays, especially on rich \"apps\" where it would be a complete bother anyway. Do Synthetic events do more than just patch old browsers quirks?\n- propTypes; Runtime type checks impossible to remove in production... Nowadays we can use typescript or flow to have quicker compilation feedback without any size overhead.\n\nJust some thoughts, this is not meant as a critic, just wondering about the design direction for React. I know, all this might only remove a few dozens of kbytes and in the grand scheme of things, it's not hugely important, but I like to think every little detail count.\n",
