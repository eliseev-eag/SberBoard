  "body": "I want to add React into the Firefox source tree, and I don't care about minification, but I do care about have different dev/prod versions. I want a prod version that is _not_ minified. I thought I could do this by building it myself, but I can't.\n\nThis simple change allows you to do `NODE_ENV=production grunt build` and so all react files are treated as production, which lets me use a non-minified version.\n",
