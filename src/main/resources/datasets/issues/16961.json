  "body": "I was playing around with some unstable Suspense APIs and noticed this strange behaviour when using `React.unstable_withSuspenseConfig`.\r\n\r\nIf I understood correctly, the purpose of `timeoutMs` field is to tell React: \"I'm okay with this update to not happen within this time. _Then_ you can show fallback.\"\r\n\r\nWhat it actually says is: \"I'm okay with this update to not happen within this time _since previous update_.\" Meaning if nothing happened for some time, fallback will show up immediately.\r\n\r\nHere's this case reproduced in sandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/romantic-chebyshev-n59dk\r\n\r\nFun thing I noticed: it works as expected if I repeatedly perform updates anywhere in my App. So it may be hard to catch in real world.\r\n\r\nMy (unfamiliar with codebase) theory is that expiration time for my update is based on last update (commit?) time, but should've been based on the time it was triggered??\r\n\r\nI know that this is unstable API and I might be misunderstanding something. Hope my case helps!\r\n\r\n---\r\nReact 16.10.1\r\nTested on MacOS 10.4: Safari 13.0.1, Chrome 77",
