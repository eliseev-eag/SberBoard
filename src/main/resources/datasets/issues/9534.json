  "body": "Apparently, when you mark something as external in Rollup, a require statement is inserted even if the module isn't used. This is causing ReactDOM and several other modules to be inserted unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nWe need a better fix for this, but I'm pushing this quick fix for now since it's blocking sync to www.\r\n\r\n@gaearon @trueadm Would you mind taking a look?",
