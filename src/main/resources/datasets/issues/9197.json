  "body": "Initial steps toward supporting string return type from `createReactNativeFiberComponent`.\r\n\r\nAddresses a circular dependency between `NativeMethodsMixin` and `ReactNativeFiber`:\r\n* New `ReactNativeFiberHostComponent` with similar interface but without unnecessary call to `findNodeHandle`.\r\n* New Flow interface for mixins to ensure `ReactNativeFiberHostComponent` and `NativeMethodsMixinUtils` stay synced.\r\n* Moved helper methods to `NativeMethodsMixinUtils` to be shared between the 2 wrappers.\r\n\r\nThis diff was submitted and reviewed internally along with other, related `ReactNative` changes. This is an upstream sync of the React-only portion.\r\n\r\nThis diff also requires upgrading Flow to get support for the `implements` keyword (added in [version 38](https://github.com/facebook/flow/blob/master/Changelog.md#v0380)) but I've done that via a separate pre-requisite PR, #9196.",
