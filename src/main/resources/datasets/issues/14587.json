  "body": "When a component with an event handler of a specific type (e.g. onClick) is mount, react dom adds a global event listener for this type. \r\nThe problem is that once all such components are no longer mount, the global event listener isn't removed. \r\n\r\nThe biggest problem that I see here is with the `onMouseMove` and `onTouchMove` event handlers. \r\nFor example, let's say that at some point there were mount components that had listeners for these event types, and later on all these components were unmounted (which means that there aren't any actual handlers for these event types). \r\nAt this point, react will keep tracking these events on the root, and each time that the pointer will move over the root, react will go over all the elements starting from the event target element up to the root element and try to see if there are handlers for these event types (though they don't actually exist). \r\n\r\nThe result is a potential performance issue, especially in mobile, since it seems that the global event handler isn't marked and can't be marked as a `passive event`.",
