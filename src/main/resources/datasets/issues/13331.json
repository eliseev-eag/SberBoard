  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nPossible bug, though it is likely this is an expected behavior that I'm misinterpreting.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nSay I have an array of components I'd like to render, but I also want to weave `<hr>` tags between each item. For example:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst Delimited = props => (\r\n  props.items.reduce((a, b) => (\r\n    <React.Fragment>\r\n      {a} <hr /> {b}\r\n    </React.Fragment>\r\n  ))\r\n)\r\n\r\n<Delimited items={[<One key=\"one\" />, <Two key=\"two\" />, <Three key=\"three\" />]} />\r\n/*\r\n  <One />\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <Two />\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <Three />\r\n*/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works, however if the components in the array have state, **they forget their state when the parent refreshes**. Seems bad.\r\n\r\nIf I rewrite the **Delimited** component so that it produces the same result by inserting the `<hr>`'s into the array, the items keep their internal state.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n// Same render as above, and if the items have \r\n// state it is retained if the parent refreshes.\r\nconst Delimited = props => {\r\n  const results = [...props.items]\r\n  for (let i = results.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {\r\n    results.splice(i, 0, <hr />)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return results\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding a `key` prop to `<React.Fragment>` doesn't change the outcome.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem:**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/n9158p8j9p\r\n\r\n1. First, click on one or more of the Toggle buttons.\r\n2. Click \"Add\", the toggled buttons should retain their state.\r\n3. Click \"Use Reduce\", which renders the buttons using `.reduce()`\r\n4. Repeat steps 1 and 2.\r\n5. This time, all of the Toggle buttons forget their state.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"123\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-08-06 at 12 25 45 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2754163/43731387-f5afe014-9973-11e8-885f-8fc57f83a56b.png\">\r\n\r\n**Click Add**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"140\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-08-06 at 12 25 54 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2754163/43731439-22d11a36-9974-11e8-9167-11e66420b30d.png\">\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt seems like the component are getting re-mounted using `.reduce()`, but updates the existing component when you use the `for` loop. Shouldn't both implementations update the existing component?\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n- React 16.4.2\r\n- Chrome 67\r\n- OSX High Sierra",
