  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIn the Devtools components tab: If the current value of a state member is a number, there is  no way to set it to an string. You cannot type quotes if it is of type 'number' and leaving it empty does not reset the value.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n1. Create a react component that has an integer value in the state.\r\n2. Find the state variable and try to type \"\".\r\n3. Erase the value and copy to the console.\r\n4. The value resets to the value it was before these steps.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nParse values in devtools like the JS compiler does for literals. \"[value]\" = string, [0-9*] = number, [[values]] = array.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact v 16.8.6\r\nDevtools v 4.0.6",
