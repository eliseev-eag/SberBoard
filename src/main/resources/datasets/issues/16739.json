  "body": "_I pulled this out of #16725._\r\n\r\nWe currently infer that a root is eligible for hydration if it has no children. The `current === null` check is just for Flow. A root will never render with no current because it comes into existence as a current with no children and then the first render is an _update_ to that.\r\n\r\nThis fixes that by setting `root.hydrate` to false after committing the first time. I also need this commit phase for event replaying anyway.",
