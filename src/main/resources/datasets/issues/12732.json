  "body": "I'm playing with Context API bitmask feature to bail out unwanted re-render.\r\n\r\nI have a dynamic model ( a JSON object) as context value. By dynamic i meant , the number of keys and structure of the JSON object is unknown. But when the JSON object changed , i know which key is changed. It seems difficult to turn the unknown keys to static pre-defined bitmasks. But I thought such use case is very common, and the bail-out feature should handle it easily by just matching the key. \r\n\r\nAlso I notice default changedBits and observedBits is MAX_SIGNED_31_BIT_INT. Does this mean it has a limitation up to 31 type of context change?",
