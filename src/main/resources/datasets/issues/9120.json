  "body": "I'm a struggling learner - I've been trying to learn for 4.5 years and still really confused about everything. I haven't found a good way to learn yet, so apologies in advance if this sort of thing is in that category of super obvious to the audience you're aiming to reach with the tutorial.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to follow along with the tutorial - about half way down the page it says:\r\n\r\n> Now we're passing down two props from Board to Square: value and onClick. The latter is a function that Square can call. So let's do that by changing render in Square to have:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n<button className=\"square\" onClick={() => this.props.onClick()}>\r\n  {this.props.value}\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think there is a mistake in the instructions. It says 'render', but there is no render in the Square class. There is return. The final result you share shows this button in the 'return'. Maybe the instructions should replace 'render' with 'return'.\r\n\r\nThanks",
