  "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nThis is just a question to clarify a behavior. Am I correct to assume that using new Hooks API would enable developers to create essentially memoized selectors by making a custom memoized hook that would read given values from reducer?\r\n\r\nSomething which very vaguely would be like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Defining a custom Hook for mapping values from reducer in any combination\r\n// necessary. getTodos is just a simple wrapper for:\r\n// state => state.main.todos\r\n// while getEmojis is another pointing to another reducer state:\r\nconst useFromReducer = ([ state, dispatch ]) => useMemo(\r\n  () => {\r\n    const emojis = getEmojis(state);\r\n    const todos = getTodos(state).map(\r\n      (v, i) => ({ \r\n        ...v, \r\n        text: `${v.text} ${emojis[i % 3]}` \r\n      }));\r\n    \r\n    return {\r\n      todos,\r\n      dispatch\r\n    };\r\n  }, [ getEmojis(state), getTodos(state) ]);\r\n\r\n// Then used in pure component like this:\r\nconst { todos, dispatch } = useFromReducer(useReducer(\r\n  rootReducer,\r\n  rootReducerInitialState, \r\n  mainActions.resetTodos));\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo doesn't that essentially mean if I wish to get any combination of data from different reducers like for example could be done in \"Reselect\", I could create a it's logic inside the hook from multiple different reducers, and just pass it as a Custom Hook to the using component? Am I completely off the base if I sense this could make it able to create Reselect like memoized selectors by hand with hooks? That would be seriously awesome! ðŸ˜„\r\n",
