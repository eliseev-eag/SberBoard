Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nGive linting warning.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\\> 16.8\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFrom my experiences with hooks so far, it seems that in any function component, `const` assignment would always associate with one hook for sure. (correct me if I were wrong...)\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think we can have a new `prefer-useCallback` rule, which gives warning whenever `const fn = () => {...}` does not wrapped with `useCallback`.  Even it does not pass with `React.memo` component, the memorization punishment can still be paid back after couple re-rendering process, and it would always ready if we later found we need to wrap some of components with `React.memo`.\r\n\r\nAlso, it almost 100% wrong when such a function pass into a `React.memo` wrapped component, which may not be obvious. Maybe we can have a lint rule to catch up this too (`guard-memo`)? Does it possible?\r\n\r\nPS. naming on rules is randomly running into my mind. Maybe someone have a better name in mind?",
