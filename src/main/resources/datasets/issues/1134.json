  "body": "_Background:_  `data-` and `aria-` properties are special-cased to allow them through.  It works naturally in JSX: `<div data-foo=\"bar\">` looks great.  However, it breaks down when directly using the React.DOM API, particularly with transpilers.  For instance, in CoffeeScript:\n\n```\n{div} = React.DOM\n\ndiv\n    dataFoo: \"bar\" # silently ignored\n```\n\nThe hyphen is required for the attributes to be picked up by the custom property regex, but hypens are not allowed as literal object property names, so it requires an ugly extra set of quotes:\n\n```\ndiv\n    \"data-foo\": \"bar\"\n```\n\n_Proposal:_  For camelCased custom properties, convert every uppercase character to a hyphen followed by the character downcased.\n\nThis won't conflict with any of the built-in properties, and since these would have been ignored anyway it shouldn't introduce any regressions.  It makes custom properties behave more like standard ones.  This is also the reverse of the transformation that jQuery makes to data attributes so it seems quite natural.\n",
