  "body": "I'm curious to hear thoughts on this PR.\r\n\r\nLooks to me like the code in this PR is shorter (smaller byte-size) and slightly more expressive. My personal opinion is that ComponentDummy parasitic inheritance pattern used here adds an unnecessary layer of misdirection. That said, if it exists for a good reason I would love to hear it!\r\n\r\nThe only criticism I might have of this PR is that Object.create is not very expressive if you're unfamiliar with its functionality.",
