  "body": "To support Suspense outside of concurrent mode, any component that starts rendering must commit synchronously without being interrupted. This means the normal path, where we unwind the stack and try again from the nearest Suspense boundary, won't work.\r\n\r\nWe used to have a special case where we commit the suspended tree in an incomplete state. Then, in a subsequent commit, we re-render using the fallback.\r\n\r\nThe first part — committing an incomplete tree — hasn't changed with this PR. But I've changed the second part — now we render the fallback children immediately, within the same commit.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13999\r\nFixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14013\r\nFixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14073\r\nFixes https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/14078\r\nFixes https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/14079",
