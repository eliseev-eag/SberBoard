  "body": "<!--\r\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\r\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nA feature (an improvement)\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen defining more than two parameters for a React.forwardRef render function a warning message stating \"forwardRef render functions accept two parameters: props and ref. Did you forget to use the ref parameter?\" gets logged.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/5v704qxvnx\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n**Option 1**\r\n\r\nOverall the message could be more explicit on accepting **exactly** two parameters. Also, when the arity is greater than 2 the second part of the message may be omitted. For instance:\r\n\r\n\"\"forwardRef render functions accept **exactly** two parameters: props and ref\"\r\n\r\n**Option 2**\r\n\r\nIf defining more than 2 arguments to the function is ok, which may be the case since the real goal for this warning is just to make sure people use the ref parameter, I think the message could not be shown for arity > 2, therefore chaging the condition of `=== 2` to `> 1`.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.5.0 which is the one that includes this new warning",
