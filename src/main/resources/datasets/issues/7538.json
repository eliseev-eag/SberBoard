  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\n\nRight now, when you use setState within render, you'll get tons of warnings. I Imagine this is quite expensive for two reasons mainly:\n1. Warnings render every time i.e setState is an anti-pattern.\n2. Rendering the message will make the browser go crazy\n**What is the current behavior?**\n\nThe current behavior makes a warning message render on each setState. This causes the browser to crash, if setState is being rendered on functions declared within the render method.\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\n\nThe bug is quite easy to reproduce, just make an function within your render method, of which, calls setState. Make it so, if you have, for an instance,  `onChange` event, you'll get the error reproduced.\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n\nYou will get tons of warnings in your console, browser will most likely freeze and you'll need to force-exit chrome/browser.\n\n**Suggestion**\n\nI really want to help out on this. I feel like I need to contribute back to React, after using it extensively. \n\nMy walkthrough would be similar to this:\n1. Find out if React has any calls, that finds out if it has rendered once\n2. Out of that, trigger warning once, or trigger the warning on the first render\n3. Experiment, and see if we can make an exception or similar, so the current build doesn't crash, perhaps, reset to the previous state if we can do something like that, and then print a message that the state resets to the previous one.\n\nES\n",
