  "body": "https://github.com/aickin/react-dom-stream/issues/22\n\n`react-dom-stream` helpfully checks `propTypes` while rendering static HTML to a stream.  But of  course React 15.2+ warns (in this case on a user `Html` `Component` with `propTypes.head`):\n\n> Warning: You are manually calling a React.PropTypes validation function for the head prop on Html. This is deprecated and will not work in the next major version. You may be seeing this warning due to a third-party PropTypes library. See https://fb.me/react-warning-dont-call-proptypes for details.\n\nThe page at that link advises 3rd party libraries to use external `PropType` libraries, but that won't work in this case because `react-dom-stream` is trying to call the `propTypes` the user has put on their components, rather than providing helpers like the 3rd party libraries the author of that page seems to be considering (e.g. `ImmutablePropTypes`).  To prevent these errors, the user would have to remove the `propTypes` on their components or replace the usages of `React.PropTypes` in their own code with some other library.  If they were using 3rd party components that declare `propTypes`, they would be out of luck.\n\nIs there an intended solution to this or was this conflict unanticipated?\n",
