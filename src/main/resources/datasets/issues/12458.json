  "body": "Recently, `react-is` was added as a dependency to the shallow renderer (#12392). This breaks the FB sync script, since we were not previously syncing the `react-is` package.\r\n\r\nI'm not super familiar with www internals, but I think the simplest solution is to tag `react-is` as one of the FB build targets (so that it gets synced) and then add a yarn stub for it.",
