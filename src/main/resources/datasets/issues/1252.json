  "body": "When using server rendering, putting an `<img>` in a `<noscript>` seems to invariably cause an invariant violation (it can't find the image).\n\nI believe this is because, to the JS enabled browser, the noscript content looks like CDATA.\n\nThis can be worked around by using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to actually set the contents to an HTML string, however, you can't nest components with this approach.\n",
