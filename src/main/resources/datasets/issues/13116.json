When the WithConstructor element is displayed, it shows how many times the constructor has been called. Clicking the button repeatedly causes the constructor to be called every time that component is displayed.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you change line 33 to be `const isEven = false` and click the button, the component's constructor will only be called once. \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe component constructor should only be called once when the component is created.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nThis is happening in all browsers. React 16.4. Unsure if this worked in previous versions.\r\n",
