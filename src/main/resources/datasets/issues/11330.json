We can always fallback to our internal fallback but that still means that others have to ship their own, which isn't cooperating with ours. (Even at FB we have two.)\r\n\r\nOur built-in one is not yet implementing the `timeout` option but since we want to start using it, we probably should.\r\n\r\nThis can become even more interesting if a [priority queue option](https://github.com/w3c/requestidlecallback/issues/68) lands (if it is sufficient for us), since we can start polyfilling that option even in native requestIdleCallback implementations.",
