Though React 16.0.0 recognizes it.\r\n\r\nOpen the below links and check the sandbox console. React 16.1.1 version has the warning displayed.\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/j45jr5mjmy - React 16.1.1 version with the above warning displayed in the sandbox console.\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/2zvy29xx8r - React 16.0.0 version without warning message.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n`allowTransparency` is recognized as a valid DOM element attribute as it's mentioned in the documentation https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#all-supported-html-attributes\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nTested and reproducible in the latest versions of Chrome, Safari and Firefox on MacOS X 10.13.1.\r\n\r\nIt worked well with React 16.0.0.\r\n",
