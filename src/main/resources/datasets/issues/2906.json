  "body": "JS sparse arrays have some advantages.\n\nSetting elements to `undefined` isn’t the same as deleting them, e.g. `[1,,,3].map(console.log)` only prints `1 3`, not `1 undefined undefined 3`.\n\nTherefore there should be a mutability helper that returns a copy with a deleted entry:\n\n``` javascript\n{ update } = React.addons\n\nlet a = [1,,,2,,3]\nlet b = update(a, {$delete: 1})\n\nconsole.log(a)  // → [1, undefined×2, 2, undefined×1, 3]\nconsole.log(b)  // → [1, undefined×4, 3]\n```\n\nPS: the same of course also applies to objects: `{foo: undefined}` isn’t the same as `{}`.\n",
