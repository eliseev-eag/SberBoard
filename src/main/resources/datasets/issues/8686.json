  "body": "This fixes #8392 and adds manual build fixtures so we can more easily check regressions like this.\r\n\r\nWe used to read ReactDOM as a global inside ReactAddonsDOMDependenciesUMDShim.\r\nThis didn't work in AMD environments such as RequireJS and SystemJS.\r\n\r\nInstead, I changed it so that ReactDOM gets injected into ReactWithAddons by ReactDOM itself.\r\nThis way we don't have to try to require it (which wouldn't work because AMD doesn't handle circular dependencies well).\r\n\r\nThis means you have to load ReactDOM first before using ReactDOM-dependent addons, but this was already the case before.\r\n\r\nThis commit makes all build fixtures pass.\r\nBuild size changes appear insignificant.",
