  "body": "I find that this is common enough to be part of core react either as a mixin or as a method for a component.\n\nThere are lot of cases when we subscribe during `componentWillMount` and unsubscribe during `componentWillUnmount`. What if we had a pattern for this.\n\n``` js\nlet ListenerMixin = {\n    componentWillMount() {\n        this._subscriptions = [];\n    },\n    subscribe(subscription) {\n        this._subscriptions.push(subscription);\n    },\n    componentWillUnmount() {\n        this._subscriptions.forEach(unsubscribe => unsubscribe());\n        this._subscriptions = [];\n    }\n};\n```\n\nI can then call it as. \n\n``` js\ncomponentDidMount() {\n        this.subscribe(TodoStore.getState(state => this.setState({ todos: state.todos })));\n}\n```\n\nThis discussion original started from this discussion https://github.com/jesseskinner/hoverboard/issues/8. https://github.com/spoike/refluxjs has `this.listenTo`.\n\n//cc @jesseskinner \n",
