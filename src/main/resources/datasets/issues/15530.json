  "body": "I get this linting error in all my components that use hooks and are camelCased:\r\n**React Hook \"useState\" is called in function \"eventForm\" which is neither a React function component or a custom React Hook function**\r\n\r\nI managed to solve this by renaming the component to be PascalCased. But as I have quite a lot of components that are camelCased I was wondering if there's a way to prevent this behaviour or is it on purpose?\r\n\r\n// Throws error\r\n```js\r\nconst eventForm = (props) => {\r\n   const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n// Ok\r\n```js\r\nconst EventForm = (props) => {\r\n   const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this is the desired behaviour I guess I'll just have to refactor my components. :D\r\n\r\nThanks!",
