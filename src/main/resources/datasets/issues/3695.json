  "body": "From the point of view of a React newbie, one of the things that stand out in the XML-like syntax of JSX, with respect to any other templating language out there, is the lack of conditional and iteration tags.\n\nIs there a reason why JSX does not have anything like this?\n\n```\n<forEach var=\"book\" in={this.props.books}>\n    <p>Title: {book.title}</p>\n    <p>Author: {book.author}</p>\n</forEach>\n```\n\nand\n\n```\n<if test={this.props.greet}>\n    Hello!\n</if>\n<elseif test={this.props.insult}>\n    Go away!\n</elseif>\n<else>\n    I don't know\n</else>\n```\n\nFor which the obvious compilation (what most of us write today) would be:\n\n```\n{this.props.books.map(function(book) {\n    ...\n})}\n```\n\nand\n\n```\n{(this.props.greet) ?\n    ...\n: (this.props.insult) ?\n    ...\n:\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nThe syntax does not have to be valid XML-like, as in my example above, since it would be compiled to specific Javascript code anyways. For example, these are shorter and still to the point:\n\n```\n<for book in {this.props.books}>\n    ...\n</for>\n```\n\nand\n\n```\n<if {this.props.greet}>\n    ...\n<elseif {this.props.insult}>\n    ...\n<else>\n    ...\n</if>\n```\n\nI don't mean to start a holy war. React is absolutely great. It just feels a bit wrong not to have some basic iteration and conditional instructions in the XML-like part, whatever the specific syntax is.\n\nIt would make the templating parts of JSX more structured and it would make it easier for HTML / CSS people to tweak the markup (add a `<div>` and such) without risk of damaging the control structures.\n",
