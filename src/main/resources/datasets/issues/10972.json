  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nfeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIn the docs it is recommended to use the constructor over componentWillMount. \r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/ebsrpraL/).**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nRecommend using componentWillMount over a constructor. In ES6 classes React does not have to provide a lifecycle hook before mounting since constructors are already defined, however, constructors are generally confusing considering they have their own ways of defining things in React. Take the following example from the tutorial:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconstructor(props) {\r\n  super(props);\r\n  this.state = {\r\n    color: props.initialColor\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nIf this were written in componentWillMount, it would look like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncomponentWillMount() {\r\n  const { initialColor } = this.props;\r\n  this.setState({\r\n    color: initialColor\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is no weird having to pass to super(props) which only happens in constructors and nowhere else in React. Also setting state is different only in the constructor and nowhere else in React. Using componentWillMount, you extract props like you normally would in any other method in a React class. Also setting state is exactly the same as every other method in a React class. I feel like having the consistency of componentWillMount is better even though ES6 classes do provide a constructor. componentWillMount also supports server rendering. Are there any benefits performance wise using a constructor over componentWillMount? Thanks!\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16",
