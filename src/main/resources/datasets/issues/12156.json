  "body": "Ideally we'd write a test for this via `react-noop` but that requires some rewiring so I didn't bother. It's even more experimental than the main `react-reconciler` anyway. We can fix this later.\r\n\r\nTest plan:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar r = require('react-reconciler/persistent');\r\nvar rend = r({\r\n  now() { return Date.now() },\r\n  persistence: {},\r\n  scheduleDeferredCallback() {}\r\n});\r\n\r\nvar c = rend.createContainer({}, true, false)\r\nrend.updateContainer('lol', c, null);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was enough to smoke-test it and verify the flag gets set (if you remove `/persistent` it crashes). There might be other issues but I think it's good for starters.",
