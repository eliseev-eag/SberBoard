  "body": "Attempting to render an `<audio volume=\"1\">` tag. Element is rendered but `volume` attribute not.\n\nIf I understand correctly, PR  #2094 introduced lots of different attributes and was rejected. However, presently React violates the principle of least surprise, by agreeing to render an `HTMLAudioElement` but only rendering some of its attributes - only those that are included in `HTMLDOMPropertyConfig`. \n\nIs there any work planned on the media tags? should React be willing to render them only with part of the attributes? wouldn't it be better to drop support completely?\n",
