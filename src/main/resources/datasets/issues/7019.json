  "body": "Virtual DOM has a lot of potential in testing. But actually only ShallowRenderer uses it in 100%, which is great. But it's only usable for unit testing. Library like [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) are great in deep rendering w/o real DOM, which is huge performance boost in case of functional (or/and integration) testing without real browser. But it uses DOM mock, which is called jsdom. \n\nIn my opinion it is totally unnecessary, because VirtualDOM rendered output is totally usable for testing (which ShallowRenderer proves). \n\nSo I made little hacky but fully working patch to ShallowRenderer, which allows to render children also ([PR here](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5513)).\n\nSo my propose is introduce something like `DeepRenderer` in test utils. I can modify my patch.\n\nIs it worth to skip jsdom? Will it be noticable perf boost? How to name that renderer? How the API should look like?\n",
