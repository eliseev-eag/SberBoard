  "body": "This removes the `examples` folder. Those examples aren't very valuable by themselves, show outdated or incomplete build configurations, and are generally confusing. I’m happy to replace them with better examples contributed by the community, but for now I’ll delete the folder. (We also have a [Wiki page](https://github.com/facebook/react/wiki/Examples) for Examples.)\r\n\r\nFor quick fiddling with the build, I added `fixtures/babel-standalone.html`. I also moved Fiber triangle and Fiber debugger into `fixtures/fiber-triangle` and `fixtures/fiber-debugger` respectively.",
