  "body": "Pushing this early so I won't lose my work if my computer combusts.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to bother with splitting this into chunks until I get most/all of the tests passing. Then I'll work on getting it into a reviewable state. (It'll probably be hard to review regardless, though, given the nature of the PR.)\r\n\r\n## Intentional semantic differences\r\n\r\nIn the old implementation, in sync mode, retrying a previously suspended tree is synchronous inside the promise resolution callback. The new implementation schedules an async callback to perform the retry. If multiple promise resolutions occur before the async callback fires, they will be batched together.\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n\r\n- [x] Basic scheduling (no Suspense)\r\n- [x] Error handling\r\n- [x] Suspense\r\n- [x] Replay errors in DEV with `invokeGuardedCallback`\r\n- [x] Discrete input events\r\n- [x] `ReactDOM.createBatch`\r\n- [x] Profiler component\r\n- [x] Interaction tracing\r\n- [x] Batching of updates within the same event\r\n- [x] 100% of tests passing\r\n- [x] Fix Flow\r\n- [x] Conditionally add FiberRoot fields that correspond to each Scheduler implementation so they don't increase bundle size\r\n- [x] Create build that has feature flag enabled",
