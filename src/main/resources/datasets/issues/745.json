  "body": "This adds some more addons.\n\nIf this is accepted we will update the documentation to have instructions for using addons from `npm` as well as from the premade builds. If using `npm` you should `require('react/lib/ReactTransitionGroup')` rather than using `react/addons` so you don't pull in extra dependencies.\n\nI think we definitely need the event plugins and TestUtils. I wasn't sure about `ImmutableObject` and `StateSetters`, but they seem like good ideas.\n\nI considered adding `ReactUpdates.injection` in there for pluggable batching strategies and `ReactPerf`, but this already works in npm today (`react-raf-batching` and `react-profiler`) and I wanted to keep this as constrained as possible.\n\nIf someone signs off on this I'll stack a commit on top with docs (or do it in a new PR, either way).\n",
