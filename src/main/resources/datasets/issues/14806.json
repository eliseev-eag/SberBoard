Unsure.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThe releases for 16.7, 16.8, 16.8.1 don't have any assets listed. When fetching remotely via automated build scripts, we're not getting anything past 16.6.1 from the assets array via github release apis.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.

Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16.6.3 was the last one with assets.\r\n",
