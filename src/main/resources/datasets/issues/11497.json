  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?** üêõ \r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nUpgrading to React 16 means node_modules/react/react.js no longer exists. However, when watching/bundling files with webpack, webpack sometimes trips and errors out trying to locate node_modules/react/react.js. It may very well be a webpack issue and not a React issue but hoping someone here can help me out. Can't get to the bottom of it. Seems to be a timing thing - only errors out every couple of file changes / re-bundles, and the rest of the time it works normally. üíÄ \r\n\r\nMy webpack config is simple, `watch` is set to true, and I use babel-loader with a `.babelrc` and `es2015` and `react` as presets.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nNever look for node_modules/react/react.js when bundling with webpack. \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?** Exists with React 16, no problems in previous versions\r\n",
