  "body": "### Depends on https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13155\r\n\r\n### (Mostly) fixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10188\r\n\r\nThis ensures that `(ReactDOM | ReactDOMServer) > ReactDOMServer > ... > ReactDOMServer` calls don't lose stacks when we exit the inner `ReactDOMServer`. We do this by keeping a reference to the previous implementation, and restoring it. I added tests that were failing before this change due to the missing stacks.\r\n\r\nSince we already need to replace and restore the inner reference to make `ReactDOM > ReactDOMServer` work, I reused the same mechanism for nested `ReactDOMServer` calls. Instead of tracking the \"current\" stack (or pushing and popping it), I'm using a closure to capture the relevant `this.stack`.\r\n\r\nI considered changing `ReactDebugCurrentFrame`'s API to expose `push` / `pop` for stack implementations instead of direct assignment. But it lives in `react` so relying on it would break usage of `react-dom@16.x` with `react@16.0`. We could maybe detect presence of `push` / `pop` and use them when they exist. For now I didn't see the benefit since Fiber isn't reentrant, and just restoring the value in `ReactDOMServer` is sufficient for most cases. But maybe I'll add this later as I work more on the warnings.\r\n\r\nNote: This doesn't currently handle the case where `ReactDOMServer` errors. I think that's okay given we didn't handle this case before either. I didn't want to try/finally it since it would make it more difficult to split DEV-only code.",
