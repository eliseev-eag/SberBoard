  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nFeature / use case\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIt seems currently there is no way to get the order of children from the children themselves with context.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI've run into this now in three use cases when building a style system: Breadcrumbs, Segmented views, and Text rhythm/spacing.\r\n\r\nExample 1, breadcrumbs. You want to show an arrow on all but the last breadcrumb, but they may be deeply nested:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nlet BreadcrumbOrder = createContext({ index: -1, total: -1 })\r\n\r\nlet Button = props => {\r\n  let order = useContext(BreadcrumbOrder)\r\n  return <div style={{ borderRight: order.index > total ? '1px solid red' : 'none' }} {...props} />\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet MyView = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <BreadcrumbProvider>\r\n      <Button />\r\n      <Button />\r\n      <div><Button /></div>\r\n    </BreadcrumbProvider>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere MyView should provide the ordering so that the sub-views can access `total` and `index` and properly style.\r\n\r\nThe other use cases are basically identical, but for different patterns. One is for joining together buttons that are in a row in the interface (Segmented), and the other is for collapsing margins when you have text elements in a vertical column.\r\n\r\nReally this ticket encompasses more of a question or request for documentation clarity here. I'm not sure how it is not pre-concurrent, but I'm assuming mount-order will be non-deterministic if not now then shortly. Is there any reference to a pattern that works for this use case?\r\n\r\nNamely: how children can access their mount order / total children. I can do it now useReducer/context, but I've seen it mount in a weird order at least once and think it was due to a suspense type thing, and would be curious a better practice for this.",
