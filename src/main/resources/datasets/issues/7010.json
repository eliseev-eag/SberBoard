  "body": "@gaearon I normally bundle React and all its add-ons in a different file from my application, but when using ReactPerf I forgot of including it in the same bundle of React and ReactDOM, so I noticed I was receiving an empty array from ReactPerf functions every time I was using them, and that is because ReactDebugTool is different for the application and for React which means flushHistory is also different.\n\nWhat do you think about warning the user if there are more than one instance of ReactPerf/ReactDebugTool in the page?\n",
