The reason was a tree-shaking [bug][1] in the rollup.\r\n\r\nAccording to @lukastaegert, this bug has been [fixed][2] and added to rollup in [v1.14.0][3]\r\n\r\nI was not sure whether to use the rollup version `1.14.0` or to upgrade it to the latest, so I updated it the latest (`1.17.0`).\r\n\r\n**Note**: One odd observation was that I ran the test with version `0.52.1` and they all still seem to pass.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/1771\r\n[2]: https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/2892\r\n[3]: https://github.com/rollup/rollup/releases/tag/v1.14.0",
