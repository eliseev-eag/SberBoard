  "body": "SVG `<image>` is supposed as far as I know to support at least the same onload and onerror events `<img>` supports.\n\nFrom looking at React code the events are handled on specific elements in `ReactDOMComponents.js` in `trapBubbledEventsLocal, mountComponent, unmountComponent`.\n\nIt would be easy to create a pull request to add 'image' to these cases, but it seems that there is a separation between js files that handle DOM and SVG in the codebase that this might collide with.\n\nAm I correct and there is more to it than just adding more cases? Or these functions are the right place to also handle SVG image?\n",
