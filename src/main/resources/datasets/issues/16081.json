  "body": "This changes responder event types to always be strings, rather than the confusing mix of either string or object (for when something needs to be marked as passive). So previously, you'd do this `{name: 'click', passive: false}`. With this change, you'd do `\"click_active\"`.\r\n\r\nFrom doing this, we can get rid of a bunch of confusing branch code and unify the event targets of both DOM and RN responders so they're just `Array<string>`. So this also removes a lot of Flow generics abstraction too.\r\n\r\nThe net result is less memory used and faster runtime performance as we no longer generate sets and listening keys, instead we loop over the small array. Looping over a small array of strings (< 10 elements) was 5x faster than converting to a key and using that as a key to lookup existence within a Set.",
