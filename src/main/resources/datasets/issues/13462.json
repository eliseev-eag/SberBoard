  "body": "This reverts commit 725e499cfb4da60da46aa5b44c4bad29cad3d08f.\r\n\r\nIt broke registration on Workplace (thankfully end-to-end tests caught this before the rollout ðŸ˜›).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why yet. We'll need to dig in deeper. The symptom is that the form that's normally controlled from JavaScript was always being submitted with default action. I guess one way this could happen is the React handler does `e.preventDefault()`, but there's a native DOM handler in the middle that does `e.stopPropagation()`. This would have no effect before this change, but with this change it would actually prevent the React handler from reaching the document. That's my hypothesis anyway. I don't know if this is what happened.\r\n\r\nThis means we probably can't make more changes to how native/React event mapping works without putting them behind feature flags. There is too much legacy code that can break unintentionally.",
