  "body": "<!--\r\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\r\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nA bug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIn the real world I used https://github.com/RubaXa/Sortable to sort array items. When I d'n'd an item I send a new sorting state to a server. It's OK when the server responds  with the same data I've sent but if the server rejects sorting and sends me the data I had in the beginning, array items don't sort back.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template for React 16: https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/, template for React 15: https://jsfiddle.net/hmbg7e9w/).**\r\n\r\nI have simulated d'n'd sorting programmatically by flipping DOM nodes via DOM interface.\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/60/\r\n\r\n- DOM is rendered using given state (A, B).\r\n- I flip DOM nodes in 2 seconds (B, A).\r\n- And set a new state which is the same as it was on the first step (B, A).\r\n\r\n`key={id}` or `key={id + index}` don't help there. \r\n \r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIt should sort nodes back (A, B).\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16. The issue also appears in React 15 https://jsfiddle.net/hmbg7e9w/1/",
