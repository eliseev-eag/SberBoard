  "body": "Adds a check to the `prepare-stable` script to prevent experimental builds from being published using stable semver versions.\r\n\r\nAlso updates the function that downloads the artifacts to pull from the correct CI job. I think instead of two separate CI workflows, a better approach might be to build stable artifacts to the `build` directory and the experimental artifacts to a `build_experimental` directory, and generate both within the same workflow. This would take some work since lots of things assume the output directory is `build`, but something to consider in the future.\r\n\r\n### Test plan\r\n\r\nRun \r\n\r\n```sh\r\n./scripts/release/prepare-stable.js --skipTests --version=0.0.0-experimental-d364d8555\r\n```\r\n\r\nand confirm that it exits with an error message.",
