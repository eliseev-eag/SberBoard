  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIn the process of converting [my Navigation router](https://grahammendick.github.io/navigation/) to the new context API I found that `propagateContextChange` sometimes gets stuck in an infinite loop. I’ve created a [JsFiddle of the problem](https://jsfiddle.net/pxzo0foq/42/). If you click the 'Name' sort Hyperlink **two times** then, on the **second click**, it enters the infinite loop. The JsFiddle is as simple as I could make it. For example, if you get rid of the 'Date of Birth' column then the problem doesn’t happen!?\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/pxzo0foq/42/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIt should not get stuck in an infinite loop\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact version 16.3.0-alpha.2. \r\nThis is to do with the new Context API introduced in 16.3",
