  "body": "Looks like a small bug in redundant re-rendering of the component even though the state hasn't changed:\r\n\r\n[Demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/elastic-hypatia-63rf5)\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\nCall `useState(1)`\r\nIn an event handler call `setState(2)` 3 times\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\nThe first setState re-renders, the second one also re-renders, and the third one doesn't.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nThe first setState re-renders, the second and third ones don't re-render.\r\n\r\nReact Version: 16.9, 16.8.X\r\nBrowser: Chrome\r\nHappens also on production builds\r\n\r\nI know it's not really a bug because we shouldn't really care about re-renders, but looks like a code smell that might point to other problems\r\n",
