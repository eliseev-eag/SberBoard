  "body": "A few related cleanup things that are easier to do together.\r\n\r\n* Makes all entry points explicit with `Entry` filename suffix. This makes it hard to include one bundle into another bundle by mistake (as we did a few times before), and probably prevents new requires to `React` or `ReactDOM`.\r\n* Changes mocks setup to be consistent between all renderers.\r\n* Removes the hacky `process.env.REACT_NATIVE_USE_FIBER` in favor of the same approach we use on www: feature flags are externalized. We already had a shim for this, but for some reason also bundled an additional file.\r\n* Deletes Stack version of test renderer (it's not used in product code anymore, neither on RN nor on www).\r\n* Moves Fiber/Stack switch into forwarding modules. This seems more explicit than Jest mocks. The relationship between `ReactDOM` (which is stack) and `ReactDOMFiber` was always a bit confusing to me, and I feel like switching *between* them rather than overriding one with the other is a bit easier to understand.",
