  "body": "Hi, thanks for the great work on React and JSX.\n\nI have a problem with JSX and comments containing curly brackets. They are evaluated by JSX, even though when writing them we consider them to be comment literals.\n\n```\n<div>\n   /* In JSX you can escape with the { and } characters. */\n   { this.state.value }\n</div>\n```\n\nIn the above example `{ and }` in the comment block is evaluated.\n",
