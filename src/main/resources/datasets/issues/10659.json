  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nI believe I am reporting a *bug*\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen I have a dynamic tag named through a const, the element attributes will be parsed correctly, but the tag name won't be resolved all the way down to it's react component and thus, won't be rendered.\r\n\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/ebsrpraL/).**\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/ebsrpraL/1/\r\n\r\nClick in the SVG box. A <Circle /> tag appears in the svg DOM with its attributes looking like html (with dashes instead of camelCase).\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIf you change \"ShapeTag\" to \"Circle\", things work as intended and another circle appears.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nBash on Ubuntu on Windows in Chrome\r\n",
