  "body": "Hi,\n\nI'm writing a library which uses JSX as an abstract DSL, a bit like `react-router` have `<Router/>` and `<Route />`, or a bit like `react-canvas` have `<Surface />` and others primitives.\n\n**To explain my question, I will take the example of `react-router`:**\n\nAn user could define a CustomRoute component that render() to a `<Route>`. \n\nand use it like this:\n\n```\n<Router>\n  <CustomRoute>\n</Router>\n```\n\nAFAIK This won't be detected by the `<Router/>` , because just traversing the props.children is not enough (router will see a `child.type==CustomRoute`, and won't understand it).\n\n**Do you know if this is possible to solve this?**\nBasically I want to descent the render() tree, and stop if it is not a user component (== it is a native component like `<div/>`), or if I reach the `<Route />` I'm looking for.\n",
