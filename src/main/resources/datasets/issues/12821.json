  "body": "Follow up for [this comment](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12745/files#r186276940) on PR #12745. Previously I was tracking base time for all fibers, regardless of whether they were inside of a `Profiler`, because the place where I started the timer didn't yet know if it was in a `ProfileMode`.\r\n\r\nI could move where I start/stop the timer somewhere else- where it would know- but this approach seemed simpler. It has a small potential downside of not measuring \"base\" time for the `Profiler` component itself- but I think this is okay because (1) that time should be minimal and (2) it isn't really actionable for a developer.\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n* ~~Should I remove the conditionals around `stopBaseRenderTimerIfRunning`? (Is it worth having them?)~~\r\n\r\n### Caveats\r\n* We pause/resume the global render timer even outside of a `ProfileMode` tree. This only updates a single numeric value though; it doesn't modify any attributes on a fiber.",
