  "body": "This should fix some bugs @sahrens was seeing.\r\n\r\nTest renderer traversal API currently treats \"fragmenty\" nodes (fragments, providers, modes) as passthrough. That usually works, but it breaks down at the top level. The `.root` node has to point to a Fiber, so if it's a \"passthrough\" Fiber, we currently invariant.\r\n\r\nIdeally I think the root node should have always been a special kind of \"root\" whose `type` and `props` don't match the nearest \"materialized\" node. But that ship has sailed, and changing this would be breaking.\r\n\r\nSo for now I want to enable those use cases by only \"materializing\" a special root node (with `type: null, props: null`) when it has multiple children.\r\n\r\nIt should be mostly additive because that kind of code used to throw. It *does* change the behavior for a top-level non-keyed fragment with many children (we used to ignore all children but the first) but this actually sounds like a bugfix to me, especially given that subsequent children were *not* ignored in the `toJSON()` API.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we probably should change `.root` to always be a special node, regardless of whether it has one or more children.",
