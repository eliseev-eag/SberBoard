  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nI wrote this component to recreate the warnings from #11081 and to fix it:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nclass App extends Component {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    super();\r\n    this.state = {\r\n      value: null,\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    this.setState({\r\n      value: 'test',\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    return <div />;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in the process found that this error came up:\r\n> 'Uncaught Error: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component repeatedly \r\n>    calls setState inside componentWillUpdate or componentDidUpdate. React limits the number of \r\n>    nested updates to prevent infinite loops.'\r\n\r\nBut the execution did not stop. It was going in an infinite loop and printing 2 variants of the same error one after another. \r\n\r\nScreenshot for your reference:\r\n![react-bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3088823/31262899-08e875b6-aa7c-11e7-9b82-15f254948a4f.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template for React 16: https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/, template for React 15: https://jsfiddle.net/hmbg7e9w/).**\r\nSnippet given above\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThere shouldn't be an infinite loop. The execution should stop after printing the error.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16, Chrome 59, Ubuntu. I tested it in older versions of react and this problem is not present there.\r\n",
