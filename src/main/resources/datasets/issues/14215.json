  "body": "Hi, Is there a known issue with the 'NestedFileTreeView'? \r\n\r\nSince updating to the latest version of React, the only way we can run webpack and get the application to display is to delete the code:\r\n\r\n'import NestedFileTreeView from 'react-nested-file-tree' and '<NestedFileTreeView'.\r\n\r\nThanks",
