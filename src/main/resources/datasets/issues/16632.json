This causes all of the `retryTimedOutBoundary` -> `scheduleCallbackForRoot` invocations to find a pre-existing `Immediate` callback already queued, and so no notifications are scheduled at all.\r\n\r\nThis is not really something that can be simulated on the mock scheduler (or I didn't find out how to), so it was brute-forced by inserting an intermediate continuation between `workLoop` and `commitRoot`.",
