  "body": "I am using React 15.6.1 and react-router-dom 4.1.2 with redux and react-redux.\r\n\r\nSimple scenario - I have a website with ReactJS and a PHP backend RESTful service. For the backend, I do not want the bundle.js code to be exposed to unauthenticated users. I have looked everywhere for a solution to this and I just cannot seem to find one. Is this possible at all in React or any JS frameworks? I understand that if the user is unauthenticated then no data would be injected into the bundle but I would rather unauthenticated users cannot see anything about my admin panel!\r\n\r\nIs there any solution at all to this?\r\n",
