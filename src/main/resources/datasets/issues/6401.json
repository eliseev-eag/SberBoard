  "body": "I was looking if we can shave off some kilobytes here and there and noticed that we ship `PropTypes` code that we never actually run in production. I tried replacing it with a noop function with identical API and it seems to save 933 bytes off the gzipped `react.min.js` and 1035 bytes off the gzipped `react-with-addons.min.js`:\n\n```\n   raw     gz Compared to last run                                             \n     =      = build/react-dom-server.js                                        \n     =      = build/react-dom-server.min.js                                    \n     =      = build/react-dom.js                                               \n     =      = build/react-dom.min.js                                           \n  +792   +130 build/react-with-addons.js                                       \n -3693  -1035 build/react-with-addons.min.js                                   \n  +792   +138 build/react.js                                                   \n -3693   -933 build/react.min.js    \n```\n\n(The dev builds grew larger though, as we branch on `__DEV__` now.)\n\nAs far as I can see this would only break tools that rely on introspection of PropTypes in the prod build but I donâ€™t think if we ever supported this usage scenario anyway. Is there any other reason that I missed why this might be a bad idea?\n",
