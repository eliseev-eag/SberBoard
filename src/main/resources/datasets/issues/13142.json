  "body": "Related to #https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7094\r\n\r\nWe need to implement a global keyboard handler.\r\nWe currently have an onkeydown handler on our main-component, which fills the whole page.\r\nHowever, by default, the <body> tag has the focus and therefore our handler of our main-component does not see these key-events.\r\n\r\nWe were thinking about adding an onkeydown handler on document, but in this case we would have to add an handler for native events. We would however like to use a handler for React's Synthetic events.\r\n\r\nSearching the web shows that many people have this same issue, but I did not find real solutions.\r\n\r\nAs far as I see, there are currently some solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Add a handler to our main-component, and make sure this main-component gets the focus, instead of the <body> tag. Problem here is that you need to make sure all the time, that the main-component gets focused.\r\n2. Add a hander to document, that handles native events. However, there seem to be problems, when the stopPropagation() or preventDefault() is called on the native events in relation to React.\r\n\r\nIs there already a good solution for this, or is there anything planned?\r\n",
