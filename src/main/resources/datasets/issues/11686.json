  "body": "So I'm creating an application with real-time streaming data in a table using react (v16.1.1). The number of rows shown at a time can be rather large (400+ rows) and when those situations occur, the scrolling behavior on browsers (desktop & mobile) really takes a hit and staggers when attempting to browse the content. Has anybody experienced this kind of scrolling behavior when rendering large data sets in a table? \r\n\r\nI'm expecting React to be able to efficiently draw/redraw these elements with ease but that doesn't appear to be the case. I tried using JSFiddle to recreate the scenario but did not have much success.\r\n",
