  "body": "I'm using Jest/ Enzyme to do unit tests in a project I'm working on, but recently upgrading to 16.5.0 has caused errors to appear in almost all of my unit tests.  The error occurs when use enzyme in a unit test to mount a component.  I've given an example of this code below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst wrapper = mount(<ComponentName value='test' />);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, since upgrading to 16.5.0, this always fails with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nInvariant Violation: Unable to find node on an unmounted component.    \r\n      at invariant (node_modules/fbjs/lib/invariant.js:42:15)\r\n      at findCurrentFiberUsingSlowPath (node_modules/react-reconciler/cjs/react-reconciler-reflection.development.js:155:30)\r\n      at toTree (node_modules/enzyme-adapter-react-16/build/ReactSixteenAdapter.js:96:60)\r\n      at Object.getNode (node_modules/enzyme-adapter-react-16/build/ReactSixteenAdapter.js:239:33)\r\n      at new ReactWrapper (node_modules/enzyme/build/ReactWrapper.js:100:33)\r\n      at mount (node_modules/enzyme/build/mount.js:19:10)\r\n```\r\nI've since downgraded to React 16.4.0 since it was not causing issues, but I think this should be looked at further.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",
