  "body": "I've created a component that takes input in a `textarea` that and generates a `tspan` for each line of the text in the `textarea`.\n\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/9130/\n\nI'm seeing the correct SVG being generated, but the browser only displays the first `tspan` on-screen. I can even paste the output into another HTML-only fiddle and see it rendered correctly.\n\nA kind soul (GreenJello on freenode#reactjs) was able to find a workaround that causes the `text` element to get re-rendered, which behaves as I expected, rendering all `tspan`s:\n\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/9168/\n\nI thought this might be a browser bug, but I was able to successfully reproduce this in both Chrome 42 and Firefox 29.\n\nIs this something related to the nature of SVG, is there a browser bug affecting multiple browsers, or is React doing something strange here?\n",
