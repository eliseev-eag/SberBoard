  "body": "Currently only IE8 is mentioned as a legacy browser in http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/working-with-the-browser.html#browser-support-and-polyfills . In your experience, should docs warn / suggest shimming some iOS or Android versions too? There might be quite many WP7.5 (IE9 mobile) and WP8 (IE10 mobile) users too (Lumias), where pointer/touch events etc won't work yet.\n\nFor example `Function.prototype.bind` is missing before Safari 5.1.4 (old iPads etc?) and I usually include even json2.js for old mobile browsers.\n",
