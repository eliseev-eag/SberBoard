Or maybe, before the `constructor()` got called?\r\n\r\nSince the `Child` is wrapped in `Parent`, The `Parent` can use `React.cloneElement(props.children, {height})` to merge and render the `Child` with `height` prop merged, so we won't see a lot of unnecessary warnings, and keep `isRequired` as a mark in Child.propTypes. \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 15.5.4\r\n",
