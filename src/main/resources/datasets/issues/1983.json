  "body": "I was running jsx with the following command line:\n\n```\njsx -w -x jsx . .\n```\n\nIn the folder being watched by JSX, I was also generating an unreasonably large JSON file (72MB... don't ask...). Whenever I recreated this JSON file, JSX would register this change and process the JSON file; as shown by the following console output:\n\n```\nData2.json changed; rebuilding...\n```\n\nThis behaviour isn't what I would expect when passing the arguments to only watch *.jsx files.\n\nAs a side note, I think that JSX was trying to process this json file because it was unable to handle such a large file, and crashed - but I think that should be the subject of another bug report.\n\n```\nData2.json changed; rebuilding...\nData2.json changed; rebuilding...\nData2.json changed; rebuilding...\nData2.json changed; rebuilding...\nData2.json changed; rebuilding...\nData2.json changed; rebuilding...\nData2.json changed; rebuilding...\nData2.json changed; rebuilding...\nData2.json changed; rebuilding...\nFATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_2 Allocation failed - process out of memory\n```\n",
