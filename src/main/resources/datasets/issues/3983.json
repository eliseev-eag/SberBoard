  "body": "The standard way to do `if` for something in the middle of a block of jsx is with a ternary or boolean expression. (ie: `{this.props.condition && <span>foo</span>}`)\n\nIf you need to do a conditional for multiple elements the natural method I expect would be:\n\n``` jsx\n{this.props.condition && [\n    <p>Foo</p>,\n    <p>Bar</p>]}\n```\n\nHowever doing so generates warnings like:\n\n>  \"Warning: Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique \"key\" prop. Check the React.render call using `<p>`. See https://fb.me/react-warning-keys for more information.\"\n\nThis array isn't a list of things that'll be reordered or anything, it's just a set of elements that are all conditional together.\n\nNone of the alternatives to avoid the warning are very good.\n\nA) Add key=\"\" to each of the element. For a few elements, which might even be inline elements like a `<b>` next to two strings, being forced to add a key=\"\" is really overboard.\n\nB) Do the condition for each element separately:\n\n``` jsx\n{condition && <p>Foo</p>}\n{condition && <p>Bar</p>}\n```\n\n...I don't think I need to explain why repeating the same code over and over is a bad thing.\n\nC) Wrap the elements in one element:\n\n``` jsx\n{this.props.condition && <div>\n    <p>Foo</p>,\n    <p>Bar</p>\n</div>}\n```\n\nAdding extra elements into code should not be required when those elements only exist to satisfy React quirks and are not actually needed inside the DOM.\n",
