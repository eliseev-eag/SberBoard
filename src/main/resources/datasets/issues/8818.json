The idea is that:\r\n\r\n* We notify DevTools of each commit (otherwise we canâ€™t accurately diff current and WIP fibers).\r\n* We keep track of all mounted roots so that DevTools can attach later. When they attach, we synchronously call their handlers with the current trees of the mounted roots, and subscribe them.\r\n",
