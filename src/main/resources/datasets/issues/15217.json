Click on one of the buttons (1 - 3).\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThe last button text is always alerted. This means that the props during the componentWillUnmount is set to the last child.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe componentWillUnmount props belong to the child that is unmounted\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nv16.4.2. \r\nUsing development in the codepen\r\n",
