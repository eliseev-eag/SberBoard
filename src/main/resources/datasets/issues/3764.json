  "body": "Hey.\n\nIm using React to render a Treeview. Since i haven't found a good replacement for my Native Javascript Drag 'N Drop Sorting Script, i sticked with it.\n\nSo, react renders and everything is fine. The DOM looks like it should be: \ndata-reactid: .0 > .0.1 + .0.2 + .0.3\n\nbut since I am using the reordering these elements, the DOM is manipulated directly. and it looks like:\ndata-reactid: .0 > .0.1 + .0.3 + .0.2   (2 and 3 got mixed up)\n\nI realized really fast, that it is anything but good. For example: when i remove the .0.3 after i reordered my list... the item with ref .0.2 doesn't work as it should be... no onClick Events is working and the render is displaying data from another element!\n\nSo i have to figure out a way to force React to completely re-render the complete Component. I've already tried the forceUpdate() method within the Component, but it doesn't seem to recognize changes to the DOM.\n\nDoes someone know a better on way how to tackle this problem?\n\n**Edit:**\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/utLrm52g/\nAs you can see in this example: I remove a Node from the rendered list and update the item-array. React doesn't recognize that data-reactid: .0.1:$three is removed from the dom...\n",
