  "body": "Hi, we reccently updated our project to  React v15.2.1 and had some issue's with svg's in IE11.\n\nSo we use svg sprites and get icon's like this: \n\n`<svg>\n          <use xlinkHref={svgIconLink(someSvg')}></use>\n        </svg>\n`\nAnd we use svg4evrybody  for cross-browser support.\n\nAfter updaiting React started to throug exception's on IE 11. \n`invariant violation couldnt find element with ID X` \n\nX - being reactid of `<use />`.\n\nAs I  understand exception fires because of svg4evrybody plugin, wich replacing <use /> with inner polyfill after page loads. \n\nAnd react can't find `<use />` because there is no use and through exeption.\n\nSo the only workaround I came up with: \n\n`\nconst use = '<use xlink:href=${svgIconLink('someIcon')}></use>';\n<svg dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: use}}></svg>`\n\nSo React dosen't include `<use />` in our virtual DOM and can't complaint about it.\n\nIs there any better way to do what? Because in my case I have to rewrite a whole lot of svg icons...\n",
