  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nRequest a feature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nDifferently than class states, useState replaces rather than merge the data (I know, I read the documentation too). But even if I break down my states into multiple useStates, sometimes we need to keep an object such as the user (id, name, category, email) and that makes this behaviour really annoying.\r\n\r\n**What I propose**\r\nHaving a second argument when constructing the usestate or updating it's value, a boolean that describes if the argument should replace or merge the actual data. Having it's default value for false (it should replace) or equivalent to what was used in the constructor.\r\n\r\n**Code example**\r\n``` javascript\r\n//Default merge\r\nconst [ user, setuser ] = React.useState(<userobject>, true);\r\n\r\n//This merges with the state because we set it as default\r\nsetUser({name:\"New name\"});\r\n\r\n//This replaces the state because we have to overwrite the default\r\nsetUser({name:\"New name\"}, false);\r\n\r\n\r\n//Default replace\r\nconst [ user, setuser ] = React.useState(<userobject>);\r\n\r\n//This merges with the state because we set it as default\r\nsetUser({name:\"New name\"}, true);\r\n\r\n//This replaces the state because we have to overwrite the default\r\nsetUser({name:\"New name\"});\r\n```",
