  "body": "#### Steps to reproduce:\n\nI created a JS Bin to reproduce the problem.\n\nhttp://jsbin.com/qegiwuzara/edit?html,js,console,output\n1. Type `Perf.start()` into the console (third pane from the left).\n2. Edit the contents of one of the text inputs in the rightmost pane.\n3. Type `Perf.stop()` and `Perf.printDOM()` into the console.\n\nThis should show that the `value` attribute of the edited text input was updated three times in the DOM, and the unedited text input was also updated once.\n\nI tested the same code with 0.13.1. According to React.addons.Perf, only the modified input was updated in the DOM, and it was only updated once.\n",
