  "body": "This one is interesting because we have transaction objects being passed around everywhere in the codebase but there's actually no Transaction class. It's a \"mixin\" that comes to life by being Object.assigned to the prototype of a real \"class\" (before class was cool!). Therefore, we can't just say `var Transaction = require('Transaction'); (transaction: Transaction) => { }` because it would be the object that contains a mixin and not an instance of a transaction.\n\nThe trick I use is to export `TransactionType` and alias it to `Transaction` in the file as it doesn't actually require transaction. In case they do, we'll figure it out, but in the few files I looked at, it doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nFor the perform function, it actually typechecks pretty well!\n\n<img width=\"715\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-08-26 at 3 22 06 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/197597/18022200/c2ab083a-6ba1-11e6-809a-602cdd67736a.png\">\n",
