Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.

Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16.2.0 reproduces this issue, and it appears to date back to 15 and earlier based on prior issues.\r\n\r\nThanks all! Let me know if there's anything else I can clarify!",
