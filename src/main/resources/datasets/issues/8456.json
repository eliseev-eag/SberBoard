  "body": "When a container is moved to a full-screen mode, `onMouseOut` listener isn't triggered for a children components, until you will move a mouse.\r\n\r\nExample/Demo: https://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/63678/\r\n\r\nHow to use an example:\r\n\r\n- Demo is for Chrome\r\n- Open a console\r\n- Click on a `FS` button, try to don't move a cursor\r\n- When in a full-screen, move now a cursor\r\n\r\nAs an expected behavior, I assume, mouse listener should be triggered as mouse leaves a component.\r\n",
