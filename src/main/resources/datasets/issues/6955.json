  "body": "Currently `shouldComponentUpdate` shallow/deep checks the components props/state and returns only a boolean value.\n\nThen, when in `componentDidUpdate` is triggered because of the proposed update hook we again need to check which prop has actually changed. So basically (in case of a deep check) we are performing the same expensive comparison twice.\n\nI know, with `immutable` props this problem would not arise, but not all react apps can commit to use `immutable` props. Also, the `style` object is often not immutable and therefore, despite beeing deep equal, would still trigger a re-render of the component.\n\nSo I propose to introduce (a non-breaking?) change to let `shouldComponentUpdate` return an array of property names that triggered the update. React would have to check\n\n```\nconst shouldUpdate = shouldComponentUpdate(...)\nreturn shouldUpdate === true || shouldUpdate.length > 0\n```\n\nThen in `componentDidUpdate` we could do:\n\n```\ncomponentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, propNames, stateNames)  {\n  if (propNames.contains(\"expensiveProperty\")) {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n",
