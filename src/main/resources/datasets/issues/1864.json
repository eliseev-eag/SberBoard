  "body": "Before this PR: http://dev.cetrez.com/jsx/2/indexie8.html\nAfter this PR: http://dev.cetrez.com/jsx/2/indexie8fix.html\n\nThere's already fix to deal with this, but `\\r\\n` incorrectly become two newlines as you can see above. With this PR, the implementation builds on our \"proven\" consistent behavior of `innerHTML` for IE8, rather than `TextNode`, so it should also be favorable in that regard.\n\nSo if there are any other inconsistencies we are unaware of with `innerHTML`, they should at least be consistent between initial render and update now, which is a preferable behavior IMHO.\n\nPairs well with #1599 and especially #1863 to enjoy less overhead, #1863 could also be transplanted into `setTextContent` if we don't want to take it as-is.\n\nPS. While we should probably follow #2273 and drop `setInnerHTML`, it would be too heavy-handed for setting text content. When that time comes, simply stripping `setInnerHTML` down to the essentials and inlining it into `setTextContent` should be the correct approach.\n",
