  "body": "`ReactCurrentOwner` is [set before the constructor call](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/ee06df1ac589cfccaa8877ea3c34d68cbb8e09d3/src/renderers/shared/reconciler/ReactCompositeComponent.js#L157-L161). If a constructor has side effects like a Flux Store dispatch, then _other_ components may get their `setState()` called. They will log a warning that `setState()` cannot be called from `render()`.\n\nThis warning is misleading because this is not what happened. It protects against `setState()` calls from `render()` but what really happens is one component causing a side effect in its constructor, leading to _other_ component getting its `setState()` called, which shouldn't result in a warning.\n\nI'm not sure it's worth fixing but something #5302 reminded me about.\nOriginal issue: https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/issues/129#issuecomment-148385030.\n\nWarning message:\n\n> Warning: setState(...): Cannot update during an existing state transition (such as within render). Render methods should be a pure function of props and state.\n\nPer https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/issues/129#issue-108755091, the issue is new to 0.14.\n",
