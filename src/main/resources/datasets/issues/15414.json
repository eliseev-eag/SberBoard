It also helps detecting side-effects in `useMemo` by calling it twice if the dependencies change. However, there's no way to simulate a purge of the cache.\r\n\r\nIt might help calling the factory in StrictMode regardless of the dependencies (or only on the second render). Other approaches like `<StrictMode areMemoDependenciesEqual={...} />` would give more control to the user.\r\n\r\nThere's already a working solution by using some feature flag at build time e.g. `React.useMemo(factory, __STRICT__ ? undefined : [dependency])` but the linter can't work with that. Using `React.useMemo(factory, [dependency, PURGE_MEMO_CACHE.current])` would make it more controllable if we write e.g. test instructions but the linter complains about those too. I don't think we have a way to detect if React is between two render calls so that we can purge the cache by flipping `PURGE_MEMO_CACHE.current`\r\n\r\nThis is also somewhat opposite to #15278 because we want an API to opt-in to cache purging.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nFuture versions of React that might forget the dependencies.\r\n",
