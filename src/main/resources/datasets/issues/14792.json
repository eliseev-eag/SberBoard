Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nSee: https://codesandbox.io/s/jl02nrqznw\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nAfter the `RendersAnotherRoot` component is initially rendered, the `useEffect` function is called and then the subsequent `ReactDOM.render` call renders the separate react root.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Uncommenting the setCount update from within the `RendersAnotherRootWithUpdate` component will then render the content from both `useEffect` render calls.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nreact 16.8.1\r\nreact-dom 16.8.1",
