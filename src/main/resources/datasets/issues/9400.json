  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nNormally when an event is dispatched, there's a place where a fakeNode is created, then the event is attached to that node, the event is dispatched then it's removed. Because these all happen synchronously, it goes into the event listener before the eventlistener is removed from fakenode. So when the second event is dispatched within the event listener, you get stuck in an infinite loop, because each time dispatch is called, both event listeners get called, then the first one dispatches the second event, so it goes on and on.... Specifically when bubbles=true. Though wasn't fully able to understand why.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/6n79t4zp/ click on Hello world, look at the console.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nShould not infinite loop. \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nNot sure about previous versions. The version I use is 15.4.1 and it does repro in the JSfiddle so 15.5.3 has the problem as well. \r\n",
