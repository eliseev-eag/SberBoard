Even you can reverse array to achieve this goal, But it's impossible to distinguish what's the end of this array because react doesn't provide an API to let framework knows the rendering is done.\r\n\r\n`componentDidMount` are always called from child instance to ancestor instance, so react is missing an\r\n approach which is doing side affects from top to bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/wk57nm7rm5\r\n`/src/rako-react/prop.js` line: 78\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nIt can work properly in sync rendering if you do side affect in constructor, but it would cause unexpected result(memory leak) in async rendering because a node may be rendered multiple times.\r\n",
