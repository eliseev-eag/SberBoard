I personally fought with such insertions. When there are a lot of them, then the meat comes and the uncontrollability of the project. At you they on the central page React.\r\nInitially, the structure of the project is unknown.\r\nI do not understand at all why React is needed and what exactly it gives, except View.\r\nAll the above described gives Angular. I'm not an employee of Angular and do not want to be.\r\nBut I will show how beautiful and relatively simple you can do on Angular https://github.com/isopen/soc\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nConvince me why I should follow the path of React.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact latest\r\nWindows 10\r\nDebian 9.3\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n",
