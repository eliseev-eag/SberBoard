  "body": "React has made recent developer experience improvements to lifecycle error handling and logging. Errors thrown during render can be recovered from using ~~`unstable_handleError`~~ `componentDidCatch`. Errors thrown during lifecycle methods are also automatically logged to the console with the component stack location to make them easier to identify (see #8785).\r\n\r\nThe team has discussed similar improvements for warnings- such as using a \"yellow box\" approach to make warnings stand out more in developer mode (see PRs #7360 and #8861). There has been some pushback though to the idea of React modifying the DOM for warning purposes (see issue #8784). I'm not sure how that will play out yet- but in the meanwhile, could we improve at least some of these use cases by making better use of the devtools?\r\n\r\nFor example, what if React exposed a new API that allowed associating a warning with one or more components in the devtools panel? (eg a method that- when called- recorded the current component stack and notified devtools if present) React could use this for things like missing or non-unique keys. 3rd party libraries may also benefit from this (eg react-virtualized could use this to warn about missing or incomplete positioning styles for cells).\r\n\r\nHere's a rough outline of some of the features:\r\n* Components with warnings could be highlighted in some emphasized way (eg yellow background) in devtools to make them easier to spot.\r\n* A new toolbar option could be added to \"Show All Warnings\" (eg filter the tree view to show only components with warnings).\r\n* Warning message could be shown inline in the settings panel for the selected component.\r\n\r\nHere's a rough mockup: \r\n![screen shot 2017-03-15 at 3 47 31 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/29597/23974108/bc3dabd6-0996-11e7-8d2a-e058c4cafe41.png)\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n* Not everyone uses devtools so this would not help a lot of people.\r\n* This would not address issues like using the development mode of React for production sites.\r\n\r\nThoughts? Ideas? Suggestions?",
