  "body": "Heya,\n\nIt seems that if I move `this.props.children` from one div to another in `render()`, I get an error if `this.props.children` contains any react components, since they have already been mounted. Intuitively, this feels like something that should work. If you use raw strings as `this.props.children`, this behaves as expected.\n\nHere's a jsfiddle demonstrating it: http://jsfiddle.net/MBNBW/3/\nIf you remove the `<i>` tag from the children ( http://jsfiddle.net/MBNBW/2/ ), it works as expected.\n\nI tried using `cloneWithProps` to get around this, but since `cloneWithProps` doesn't clone children, it just nests this problem one level deeper (`<i>` works, but `<i><b>` doesn't).\n",
