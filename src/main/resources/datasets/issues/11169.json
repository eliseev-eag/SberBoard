  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug?\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nRendering a portal to `document.head` on the server causes React to log a Warning on unexpected markup while hydrating server markup. Currently this happens when using [react-head](https://github.com/tizmagik/react-head)\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template for React 16: https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/, template for React 15: https://jsfiddle.net/hmbg7e9w/).**\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it's possible to simulate this in jsfiddle, since it requires server-rendering and access to `document.head`, but a fairly minimal repro case is in [react-head's example app](https://github.com/tizmagik/react-head/tree/master/example), which you can clone and run via doing the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:tizmagik/react-head.git\r\ncd react-head\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm run dev\r\nopen http://localhost:3000\r\n```\r\nYou'll then see the React warning logged.\r\n\r\nIf you have thoughts on a simpler way to repro this, happy to do that as well!\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIt's entirely possible that this is just a usage of React Portals that wasn't anticipated, but i'm not sure if this is an invalid use case? Would like to get your thoughts and if there's a better approach than what I'm currently doing with react-head?\r\n\r\nBesides the warning, the module/app seems to function exactly as expected.\r\n\r\n_At a high level, this is how react-head works:_\r\n\r\nDuring server-rendering `<head />` tags (e.g. `<meta />` etc) are [collected in an array](https://github.com/tizmagik/react-head/blob/master/src/HeadTag.js#L41), which are [`renderToString()`d and placed in the server template `<head />`](https://github.com/tizmagik/react-head/blob/master/example/src/server.js#L39), then on the client, these server-rendered tags are [querySelected and removed](https://github.com/tizmagik/react-head/blob/master/src/HeadTag.js#L20-L30), to be replaced by [ReactDOM.createPortal()](https://github.com/tizmagik/react-head/blob/master/src/HeadTag.js#L38) in order to support SPA functionality from then on.\r\n\r\nHere's the issue in react-head: https://github.com/tizmagik/react-head/issues/1\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16\r\n",
