This works fine in 16.3.1 so I am not sure if your code got more stringent or if this is a bug detecting things it shouldn't. I have changed my code to work either way, but many third party libraries are breaking with this change.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThis should work identical to 16.3.1 (if this is a new thing they this should be 16.4.x or maybe even larger)\r\nRolling the code back to 16.3.1 works normally.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16.3.2",
