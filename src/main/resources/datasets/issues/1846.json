  "body": "I haven't really thought this through extensively yet, but I figured it could be worth just having a discussion about it.\n\nWe must currently run the entire `render()` function for every change that happens, regardless of how insignificant the change is. When animating we often just want to change the position or color of a single element, but still have to run the entire `render()` every frame.\n\nJust to give you an idea of what I mean, it could look something like the code below. But I imagine that there are also more fancy ways of doing it, where you could instead get an observable for any variable in state/props, avoiding the creation of mutable observables in state and making it more React:y.\n\n**Edit:** To be clear, this shouldn't replace the render()-function, it's meant as a feature for when you really need to squeeze every last bit of performance out of animations and other performance intensive (but individually simple) updates.\n\n```\nvar Comp = React.createClass({\n  getInitialState: function() {\n    return {\n      boundWidth: React.observable(this.props.width)\n    };\n  },\n  componentWillReceiveProps: function(nextProps) {\n    this.state.boundWidth(nextProps.width);\n  },\n  shouldComponentUpdate: function() {\n    return false;\n  }\n  render: function() {\n    return (\n      <div style={{width: this.state.boundWidth}}>\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nJust food for thought.\n",
