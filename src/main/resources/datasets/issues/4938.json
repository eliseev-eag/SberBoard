  "body": "This means that custom React implementations cannot use react-dependent libraries (react-router) without preventing ReactDefaultInjection.inject() from running, and also results in a fair amount of bloat as unnecessary DOM-related files are included in the build.\n\nAs I understand it, the react core and react-dom are now separate so as to prevent this issue. Why would react core transitively require react-dom? Wouldn't this also prevent someone from using react-router in react-native?\n\ncc @mjackson @ryanflorence in case I'm missing an obvious solution. Thanks all.\n",
