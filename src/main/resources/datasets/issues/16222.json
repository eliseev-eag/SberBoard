  "body": "If you try to use a component which does not exist:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<Foo />\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou would get this real nice and clear compilation error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./src/components/pages/ProfilePage.js\r\n  Line 547:  'Foo' is not defined  react/jsx-no-undef\r\n\r\nSearch for the keywords to learn more about each error.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if you try to use a member-component (I'm not sure how they are actually called) which does not exist:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<Button.Foo />\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou get this huge mess:\r\n\r\n```\r\nElement type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.\r\n\r\nCheck the render method of `ProfilePage`.\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though it does hint there might be something wrong in the `ProfilePage` render method, we tend to look at the stack-trace first which is completely useless in this case, starting with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n 4 | import App from \"./App\";\r\n   5 | import registerServiceWorker from \"./registerServiceWorker\";\r\n   6 | \r\n>  7 | ReactDOM.render(\r\n   8 |     <BrowserRouter>\r\n   9 |         <App />\r\n  10 |     </BrowserRouter>,\r\n```\r\n\r\nI ran into this problem, when I tried to use React-Bootstrap's `Alert.Heading` component, but accidentally wrote `Alert.Title`. I went over pretty much all of my changes several times and missed it every time. Took me several hours to find the mistake. Same thing could happen if you simply mistype an element name like `Alert.Headign`.\r\n\r\nI suggest generating an error message with more information in this case. For example you could add the line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nButton.Foo is not defined\r\n```\r\n\r\nsomewhere in the error message.",
