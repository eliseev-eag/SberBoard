  "body": "I know this has been discussed in various places in the past, specifically requesting that @gaearon add it to redux IIRC.  I know the reasoning behind not using something like this is somewhat sound and this is a topic that doesn't really have a perfect solution at this time... but what other \"drawbacks\" can you guys think of to a package to `hoist-non-react-methods` when utilizing HOC?\r\n\r\nThe way I was previously doing it doesn't work with React16 / Fiber so I've recently had to rewrite it a bit and move the logic into `componentDidMount` and use a ref of the child rather than the component prototype... but it appears to do the job well enough.  \r\n\r\nWant to make sure I am not forgetting something significant, especially with how Fiber works.\r\n\r\nObviously using this heavily wouldn't be a good idea, but in this case it is a HOC which largely should be invisible in its implementation (simply injecting a prop).  Changing how passing refs works simply didn't seem to be an appropriate solution. \r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/bradennapier/5a61c77318b075cf0e4bc207c40faba8\r\n\r\nWhere the implementation would look something like this:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/bradennapier/59192f736bf1c4d77a4cda8a7532facf\r\n\r\nObviously it isn't ideal... just trying to consider the best way to implement a more transparent way of handling this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo far the only real problem I can see with the implementation would be methods which are not present on the child at the time of mounting... which I think is acceptable drawback.  I would think it wouldn't be too hard to adjust for that situation as well though?",
