  "body": "Dan Abramov mentioned that Devtools v4 will be making `react-hot-loader` obsolete: https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1144715740983046144?s=20\r\n\r\n> **Me:**\r\n> I have this hook:\r\n> ```require(\"react-reconciler\")(hostConfig).injectIntoDevTools(opts);```\r\n> But HMR has always worked completely without it. Is this now a new requirement?\r\n\r\n> **Dan:**\r\n> Yes, that's what the new mechanism uses. The new mechanism doesn't need \"react-hot-loader\" so by the time you update, you'd want to remove that package. (It's pretty invasive)\r\n\r\nI can't see any mention of HMR in the Devtools documentation, however; now that `react-hot-loader` has become obsolete (and with it, the `require(\"react-hot-loader/root\").hot` method), how should we set up apps for HMR in:\r\n\r\n* React DOM apps\r\n* React Native apps\r\n* React custom renderer apps\r\n\r\nI'd be particularly interested in a migration guide specifically for anyone who's already set up HMR via `react-hot-loader`.\r\n\r\nAlso, for HMR, does it matter whether we're using the standalone Devtools or the browser-extension Devtools?",
