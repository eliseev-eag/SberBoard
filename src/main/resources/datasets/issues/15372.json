  "body": "Note: the experimental event API is for internal purposes only right now\r\n\r\nThis PR adds two new event targets that recently came up in discussion. They're not used or have any specific code paths yet, but they will do in the future. They are `FocusTarget` and `PressTarget`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a new helper method on the event responder context has been added: `getEventTargetsFromTarget`. This method can query the internal fiber tree to find event targets and their associated host components and props â€“ given the optional `type` and `key` query arguments.\r\n\r\nRef #15257",
