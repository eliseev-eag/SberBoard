  "body": "Our current benchmark script runs all trials in a specific order.\r\nYou can try it by running:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd scripts/bench\r\nyarn\r\nyarn start\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Note: it takes a looong time to finish.)\r\n\r\nI think running all trials in a deterministic order like we do now may actually introduce issues. Such as if some other process starts grabbing CPU in the middle of the trials, a specific set of trials (e.g. \"HN\" benchmark on \"base\" repo)  will be affected, and the results skewed.\r\n\r\nBut if we ran all trials in a random order, I would expect any temporary changes to be evenly distributed between random runs, and thus not favor any particular version or benchmark. Wouldn't that be better?\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense? Tagging as a good issue to look into, but I don't promise this would be easy.",
