  "body": "During tests (with react-testing-library) a random test randomly fails\r\nwith \"TypeError: Cannot read property 'body' of null\" in the getActiveElement.\r\nIt appears that sometimes the `doc` is null but the check in the file only\r\nchecks for undefined. This proposed change checks for both `null` or `undefined`\r\nwhich should prevent the failures.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/15691\r\n\r\n**Before submitting a pull request,** please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.\r\n2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n5. Run `yarn test-prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) typechecks (`yarn flow`).\r\n10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n**Learn more about contributing:** https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n",
