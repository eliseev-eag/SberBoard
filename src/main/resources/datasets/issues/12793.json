  "body": "This complements https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12791 although doesn't depend on it.\r\n\r\nWhile working on https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12792 I realized that we call `ReactFiberReconciler()` twice in the same file (`ReactNoop`), once with a mutating and once with a persistent mode.\r\n\r\nIf we make the host config resolved through imports, we can't change what one copy \"sees\" without changing what another copy \"sees\" unless we reset modules in the middle. That's what I do with ReactDOM and ReactART in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12792, but I can't `resetModules` between two `ReactFiberReconciler()` calls in `ReactNoop` because they don't happen inside the testâ€”they happen in `ReactNoop` itself.\r\n\r\nWith this change, we clearly separate `react-noop` and `react-noop/persistent`, can remove the awkward `renderToPersistentRootWithID` method in favor of normal render, and avoid the problem.\r\n\r\nNote: this change isn't necessary because we want to inline ReactNoop host config itself (actually I want the opposite: to keep using it for testing the custom renderer infra). But it is necessary because `ReactPersistent-test` won't work in a world where the reconciler modules import host config from a file because we don't get a chance to change what this file points to midway while executing `ReactNoop`. In practice we don't even use mutating and persistent versions of `ReactNoop` in the same test file even once.",
