  "body": "Hi React Team !\r\n\r\nHere in Clovis.pro (React 15.4) we want to enhance React performances on quite old phones and tablets. Sometimes multi-component updates could slow down the phone and make the UX uncomfy (that's normal, basic javascript uses the CPU and old hardware have low CPU).\r\n\r\nTo enhance React performances did you made and update in React Fiber to directly allow the javascript to be run by the GPU ? Or do you know libraries to make that global hack ? Thanks ! :wink: \r\n\r\nps : GPU is already used in CSS with Translate3D to make animations smoother.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
