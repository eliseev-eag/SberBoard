  "body": "Preemptively update tests wrt 'parser' requiring an absolute path rather than a package name, even though the project is still using ESLint 4.\r\n\r\nTested locally by upgrading eslint (and all `eslint-*` dependencies) to their latest versions (using `yarn upgrade-interactive --latest`) and then running `yarn test`. Without the change to the tests, they expectedly failed due to the `parser` option not being an absolute path; with the change to the tests, they all pass.\r\n\r\nFixes #15971",
