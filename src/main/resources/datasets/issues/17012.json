  "body": "Following up on #15778, this is needed before being able to upgrade to Jest 25, which will have some significant performance improvements. Some tests for `style` properties are failing though, and I have no idea if it's due to jsdom or the tests themselves. I have some hope you'll know what's up yourselves ðŸ¤ž  \r\n\r\nI tried upgrading to the Jest 25 alpha btw, and it fails in the same way, so if it's an issue with jsdom itself, it has not been fixed for jsdom@15 and it'd be great to report it to them.\r\n\r\n/cc @threepointone ",
