It means that we sometimes inherit\r\ndidReceiveUpdate from a previous component's begin.\r\n\r\nEffectively this only means that we're overrendering in some cases.\r\n\r\nWe should refactor to get rid of this as a global flag.\r\n\r\nI donâ€™t have a test case because it only showed up as an intermediate state in another test. Maybe we can come up with something simplified.",
