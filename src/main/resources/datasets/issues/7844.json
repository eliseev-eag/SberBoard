  "body": "**What is the current behavior?**\nAfter rendering a React view on the server, React appears to mount without errors on the client but does not remove the `data-reactid` and `data-react-checksum` attributes from the DOM. So far I've only observed the issue when using React Router v4 (also reported as ReactTraining/react-router#3984), but the RR folks have characterized it as a React issue.\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.**\nRepro repo at https://github.com/phyllisstein/react-router-v4-isomorphic-glitch.\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nWhen mounting, React should remove the extra attributes from the DOM.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\nReact v15.3.2, in all browsers tested so far (Chrome, Safari, IE). Does not appear to get better after rolling back to earlier React versions, but could not be reproduced with React Router < 4.\n\n---\n\nHappy to provide as much debugging information as I can, but honestly not sure where to start troubleshooting on my own. Thanks in advance for any guidance or illumination you can provide!\n",
