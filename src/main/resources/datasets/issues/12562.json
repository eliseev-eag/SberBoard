  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nDepends on how you look at it. Sure looks like a bug to me.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen `getDerivedStateFromProps()` doesn't explicitly return anything a warning is being output to the console:\r\n\r\n> Warning: getDerivedStateFromProps(): A valid state object (or null) must be returned. You have returned undefined.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nTreat `undefined` as `null`.\r\n\r\nIt's really inconvenient to add an extra unneeded `return null` statement in the end of `getDerivedStateFromProps()`.\r\nIt is an unnecessary complication of code, adding a no-op line, making everybody's code less clean.\r\nThere's no reason not to treat `undefined` same as `null`.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.3.1",
