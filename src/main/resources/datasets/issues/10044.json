  "body": "In #10024, I added `node-stream.js` to `react-dom`'s distribution, but I didn't realize that `react-dom`'s package.json specifies which files are to be uploaded to the npm registry. As a result, if we tried to publish `react-dom` right now out of master, `node-stream.js` would not be a part of the package.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that. Sorry!",
