  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen subscribing to DOM events it's possible to use capturing. However it seems that capturing takes place after the vanilla JavaScript bubbling phase. This results in an incorrect order of events unless all events are subscribed to via React which isn't always possible.\r\n\r\nHere's an example that mimicks one of our use cases: https://jsbin.com/zuleceg/1/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nA capturing event subscribed to within React, should take place before bubbling events subscribed to via vanilla JavaScript.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?**\r\nDevelopment edition, Chrome v64 x64\r\n",
