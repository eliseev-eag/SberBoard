  "body": "This strategy keeps track of any available DOM nodes (\"host instances\") that we can reuse. They're stored in `ReactFiberHydrationContext` as we're reconciling and then picked off if they match. Any remaining non-matching nodes are deleted, others are inserted.\r\n\r\nThis is using the normal reconciliation model so it should be possible to run in async mode so that reviving doesn't block the main thread. Currently, there are some properties that are set eagerly and events gets wired up early so that will break in async mode. I'll leave that as a todo.\r\n\r\nThis detects whether to revive or clear the container based on whether the child has a `data-reactid` attribute. We might want to change this API to be explicit.",
