  "body": "Fixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9589 (again).\r\nWe started with https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10446, then reverted it in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10673 over concerns in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10640.\r\n\r\nThis time we don’t rely on `toString` inside ReactDOM itself. Instead we report to React DevTools if they exist, passing the function itself as an argument.\r\n\r\nReact DevTools can check for `^_^` there and both produce the “red React” and potentially even do the `setTimeout` trick to report the error to analytics.\r\n\r\nThis doesn’t have the same concerns as explained in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10640 because we’re not doing it for *every* user but only for React developers who visit React-powered websites which are also built with CommonJS. So it’s a smaller slice. If we suddenly can’t rely on `toString` anymore we can always cut that code from DevTools.",
