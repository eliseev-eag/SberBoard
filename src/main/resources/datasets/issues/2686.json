  "body": "We've been using [Sentry](https://getsentry.com) to log errors [in our server-side rendering](https://github.com/getsentry/raven-node) and [client-side](https://github.com/getsentry/raven-js). Unfortunately, the [error message](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/5d3b12bb3bd6a092cf00ede07b8255a8399c2e58/src/vendor/core/invariant.js#L34-L38) that React throws in production mode is pretty useless, so we wind up with a lot of unactionable reporting.\n\nReact has two levels of errors—warnings (those logged to the console) and errors (the ones that are thrown)—but both are enabled/disabled using the same env var/compile option. It would be really great if there were two different options so that I could reap the benefits of disabling warnings (e.g. from runtime type checking) without losing meaningful error messages (for example, from checksum violations).\n\nThanks!\n",
