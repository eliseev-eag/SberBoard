  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nThis is a code snippet to make one input \"follow\" a React expression until the user changes the field manually. This is accomplished by wrapping `input` with a Reach component, `Input`. Ideally, any property for `input` will work for `Input` - including `onChange` handlers.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, it's intended to let an `Input` follow the value of a regular `input` element.\r\n\r\nWhen the `input` element wrapped by the `Input` component is changed, a React synthetic event is (as expected and desired) created and sent to the handlers.\r\n\r\nHowever! When the \"followed\" `input` element is changed, the `Input` component `onChange` is triggered, with (AFAIK) a regular, non-synthetic `event` object.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/4o6ypzg4/\r\n(events are written to the console; open it up and take a look)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe `Input` component's `onChange` handler receives a React synthetic event.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 15.3.0, 15.4.2; Chrome 55.0.2883.95 (64-bit) on MacOS\r\n",
