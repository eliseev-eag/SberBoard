  "body": "We're having trouble with one of our animations. It's a simple fade in and fade out animation. While stepping through in Chrome dev tools, our element is being rendered on the page but the `.transition-enter` class is never being applied. However, the `.transition-enter-active` class gets applied by itself.\n\nThe `.transition-leave` and `.transition-leave-active` seem to be getting added correctly.\n\nOur example code is almost identical to the [Getting Started code in the docs](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html#getting-started).\n\nWe're running React 0.12.2.\n\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks!\n",
