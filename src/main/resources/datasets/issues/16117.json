Sorry if it's already reported/discussed.\r\n\r\nI spent quite a while trying to understand why [this](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-context-api-c81jb) doesn't work, as it's a VERY simple user case and I was following the new context api instruction verbatim when doing it \r\n\r\nI know how to make it work, but it's more like a walkaround. I really want to know why my example doesn't work and if it's a bug, we should fix it.\r\n\r\nthanks",
