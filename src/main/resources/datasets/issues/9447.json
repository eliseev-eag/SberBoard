I think it's more of a browser problem than a React problem as it updates the DOM fine but I thought there should be a discussion on solutions/next steps.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nSource `src` example: https://jsfiddle.net/danbovey/km5c3zmq/\r\nAudio `src` example: https://jsfiddle.net/danbovey/v40cbwpx/\r\n\r\nThe browser is not recognising any changes React makes to the `src` prop of `<source>`, if you change the `src` prop directly on the `<audio>` tag the browser re-renders/resets the audio tag as expected.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe source example should match the behaviour of the audio example. Happens in all browsers.",
