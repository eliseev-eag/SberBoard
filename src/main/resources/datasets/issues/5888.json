  "body": "First I know this is an anti-pattern so please forgive me. I was doing something like this recently but noticed that on the first render the `this.state.origValue` was `undefined`:\n\n```\ngetInitialState: function() {\n    return {\n        origValue: this.props.mydata.some_data\n    };\n},\n```\n\nThe `props` did eventually get populated and was available on the next render. However as `getInitialState` is only ever called once `this.state.origValue` is always going to be `undefined`.\n\nI fixed the issue by setting `this.state.origValue` in `componentDidMount`. However I wonder if its a bug that `this.props` isn't always available in `getInitialState`?\n",
