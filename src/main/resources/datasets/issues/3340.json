  "body": "This is tough for me to explain so I created a fiddle to demonstrate it. I have a layer/portal/whatever we are calling this pattern, that renders the children of a component to a new tree off of body via `React.render()`. I would expect context to also be passed, and I've taken special care to make sure the child to be passed to `.render()` is created with the correct owner. It all works fine context is passed, but it is never updated at that point. If I inspect the child element to be passed `._context` is correct but `.context` is never updated on the instance. Not sure if perhaps I just have the wrong expectation here?\n\nHere is an illustration: **(updated with simpler example)**\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/3772/\n",
