  "body": "The `valueAsDate` property on the ES6 definition of `HTMLInputElement` is not yet recognized by React. It should be, though.\r\n\r\nThe `valueAsDate` property relieves the pain of having to deal with both browsers that support HTML5 date inputs and those who don't; the former require the `value` property to be of the form `\"YYYY-MM-DD\"` and the latter require a nicely formatted date (e.g. `\"MM/DD/YYYY\"`) since the user will see exactly that. (React won't even allow that in conjunction with `type=\"date\"`, though, and proclaim that the machine readable format should be used.) \r\nThe browsers that do support HTML5 date input (should) alternatively support the date being passed in through the `valueAsDate` property. If we use that, we can always put a nicely formatted date in the `value` property. Pain relieved! (And also React should allow any format in the `value` property in that case.)\r\n\r\nAs indicated above, browser support is still lacky at best, even with the most avant garde browsers. Hence this is not an urgent issue for React. It will get relevant, though, and is herein duly noted.",
