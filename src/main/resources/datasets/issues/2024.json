  "body": "Sorry if this is a dupe (couldn't really tell from other animation bugs), but I noticed with the CSSTransitionGroup class that it doesn't seem to handle multiple transition properties on enter very well. Take this example:\n\n```\n  .action-tray-enter {\n    transform: translateY(100px);\n    opacity: 0.01;\n    transition: all .25s ease-in 0.3s;\n  }\n\n  .action-tray-enter.action-tray-enter-active {\n    transform: translateY(0);\n    opacity: 1;\n  }\n\n  .action-tray-leave {\n    transform: translateY(0);\n    opacity: 1;\n    transition: all .25s ease-in 0.1s;\n  }\n\n  .action-tray-leave.action-tray-leave-active {\n    transform: translateY(100px);\n    opacity: 0;\n  }\n```\n\nIf you try to remove the node while the enter animation is still occurring, it looked like it was abruptly removing the node without triggering the leave animation. If you switch from `all` to just one property for the enter animation, it works as expected: wait for the enter animation to finish, then trigger the leave animation.\n\nI can provide a fiddle later.\n",
