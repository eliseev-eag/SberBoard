So I added `shouldComponentUpdate` hook to detect if child re-render is necessary or not.\r\n\r\nWhile doing that, I noticed a behavior where nextState received in shouldComponentUpdate and `this.state` are equal. I am assuming this is not correct behavior considering the goal of `shouldComponentUpdate`.  Please check the example in  [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/3rxlyyv1w6)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nAssuming the `nextState` should not be equal to `this.state` when `shouldComponentUpdate` is called. \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI am not sure about previous versions of React. But the current React version I checked is `16.8.0`",
