While navigating and scrolling down the component tree, when a components scrolls into frame whose name cannot fit horizontally, the entire tree flattens. This makes it difficult to discern between parent, sibling, and child components.\r\n\r\n![devtools](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1900645/64652970-2606bc00-d3f3-11e9-8bcd-45ad2c43dd19.PNG)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI would expect the component tree to either scroll horizontally or truncate component names that are excessively long, while still including indentation for child components.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact v16.3.0\r\nChrome v77\r\nDevTools v4.0.6\r\n",
