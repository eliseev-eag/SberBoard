  "body": "The `componentWillReceiveProps()` method only triggers if props change. However, there are situations where the context changes, but the props do not, but this method does not trigger. It makes it really difficult to alter the state before an update, as we can't do this in `componentWillUpdate()`.\n\nPerhaps a new method, like `componentWillReceiveContext()` can be added, or the previous `componentWillReceiveProps()` can simply be renamed to something like `componentWillReceive()`, which is always called if any prop/state/context has changed.\n",
