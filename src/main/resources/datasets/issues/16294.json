  "body": "*useReducer* can be used for local state management. And *dispatch* produced by *useReducer* can be used locally or inside underlying components.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes it would be nice to \"connect\" arbitrary components in tree.\r\nSome kind of global event/action bus but without global state.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I propose the *useDispatcher* hook in addition to *useReducer*:\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/embed/react-hooks-usedispatcher-gw6u9\r\n\r\nIt something like pattern-based discovery in microservices. Upsream and downstream remain loosely coupled.\r\n",
