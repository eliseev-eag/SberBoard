  "body": "as [hook API](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext) states, The current context value is determined by the value prop of the nearest <MyContext.Provider> ***above the calling component in the tree.*** \r\n\r\nbut before react new Hooks feature, we could use provider and consumer in the same component and the consumer always points to the nearest component, not nearest above the calling component.\r\n\r\nthis [sandbox ](https://codesandbox.io/s/gallant-elgamal-23r81) shows that only the useContext has unexpected behavior based on other methods of accessing context value.\r\n\r\nI think this is by hook's limit, or isn't it?\r\nso based on what premise useContext doesn't provide the value form the nearest provider? isn't it unexpected?\r\n",
