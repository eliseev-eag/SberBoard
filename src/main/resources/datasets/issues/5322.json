  "body": "As the docs state:\n\n> You must provide the key attribute for all children of ReactCSSTransitionGroup, even when only rendering a single item. This is how React will determine which children have entered, left, or stayed.\n\nAs the key-attribute is mandatory for the animations to function, it would make sense to warn if the key props are missing for the direct children, similarly how dynamic children warn about missing keys.\n\nSomething like: \n\n>  Each child in ReactCSSTransitionGroup should have a unique \"key\" prop. Check the render method of foo\n",
