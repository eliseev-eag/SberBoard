  "body": "Currently, you get an error when react tries to update the DOM, and things aren't as expected.  Early errors are much better, so in development React should give clear errors based on valid HTML structures. \n\nFor example, the select element has 1 valid child: option.  The option element has 1 valid child: text node.  Forms have one invalid deep child: form; and tables have a quite a few rules.\n\nThe suggested error format:\n\n```\nInvariantViolation: at FooComponent <select> may only have <option> children, but \nencountered: option, option, select, option, option\n```\n\nForms.  The element:N means displayName:childIndexIfNotZero.\n\n```\nInvariantViolation at FooComponent: <form> may not have any deep <form> children.\nCulprit is form > div > form\n\nInvariantViolation at FooComponent: <form> may not have any deep <form> children.  \nCulprit is form -> div > div:3 > section:2 > BarComponent > div > form:1\n```\n\nTables\n\n```\nInvariantViolation at FooComponent: <table> may only have <caption>, <thead>, <tfoot>, \nand <tbody> children, but encountered thead, tr*100\n\nInvariantViolation at FooComponent: <table> may only have one <thead> child, but \nencountered thead, thead, tr*100\n\nInvariantViolation at FooComponent: <table> may only have one <thead> child, but \nencountered thead, thead, tr*100\n```\n\nThe less frequently encountered situations can be pushed to a different release, but I think it's important to have.  These are bad habits that people are used to, because they're allowed in most other situations.\n\nThese are examples of people who have run into this problem.  \n\nselect/option\n- https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/2620 \n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27776780/react-js-invariant-violation-findcomponentroot\n\nnested forms:\n- https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/1987\n\ntables\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21594009/removing-row-from-table-results-in-typeerror\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26689900/react-js-invariant-violation-processupdates-when-rendering-a-table-with-a-di\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26809950/reactjs-dynamically-hiding-and-showing-table-column-causes-invariant-violation\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25026399/uncaught-error-invariant-violation-findcomponentroot-110-unable-to\n",
