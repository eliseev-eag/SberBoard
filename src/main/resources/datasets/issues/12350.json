  "body": "In issue #11079, @nhunzaker mentions that it would be nice to have an automatic deployment of [the DOM Fixtures folder](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/fixtures/dom) for manual and automated testing purposes.\r\n\r\nSince [Netlify offers their services for free to open source projects](https://www.netlify.com/open-source/) (an account for this will need to be set up), I thought it would be a great fit. \r\n\r\nThis commit adds a `netlify.toml` file to the repo, allowing easier deployment out to the service.\r\n\r\nThis file will do two things:\r\n1. On master branch update, it deploys the latest code to the main linked netlify site. For example: https://musing-lewin-a6efa4.netlify.com/\r\n2. For every PR opened, creates a 'Deploy Preview' site for validating that PR's changes. For example: https://deploy-preview-1--musing-lewin-a6efa4.netlify.com/\r\nThe preview site is linked via GitHub in the PR. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/706039/37229973-7bf92c78-23ab-11e8-8ca1-aa1c63ccd2b1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Test Plan:**\r\nCreate a Netlify account and [connect the github repo you're testing to it](https://app.netlify.com/start).\r\nAfter connection, Netlify should deploy the DOM fixtures build folder to a live site for you to use.",
