  "body": "This is closer to the original implementation. We're already storing the current values on the context object itself, so we shouldn't be storing them on a stack, too. The only reason I added a stack of provider fibers was so we could reset all the in-progress contexts during an interruption (`resetProviderStack`). I think the presence of a stack was misleading, including to me, because it's easy to confuse it with how the legacy context API works.\r\n\r\nThe linked list version is more straightforward and hopefully harder to screw up. For `resetProviderStack`, I'm using a Set to avoid duplicate entries.\r\n\r\nNo additional tests because the behavior should be the same.",
