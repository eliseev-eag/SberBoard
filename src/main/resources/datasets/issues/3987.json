  "body": "I was writing some tests for my components and was trying out the new feature of the Shallow Renderer.\n\nFor example, I wanted to assert that some anchor tags were rendered with certain inner text. However, the rendering is so shallow that it doesn't even give me access to the text, they just show up as \"spanContents.\"\n\nAm I missing something? If you can only assert things at the very top level, then I guess I'd be better off just rendering to string and feeding it into an HTML parser.\n",
