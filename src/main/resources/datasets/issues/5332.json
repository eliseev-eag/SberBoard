  "body": "IFrame onLoad event handler  is called in Firefox but not in Chrome. I am using Firefox v41 and Chrome v46 and react v0.14.0. The 'load' event is fired in both Chrome and Firefox but the onLoad event handler is only called in Firefox. Here is a jsfiddle demonstrating the issue.\n\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/varungupta85/xa1m0aLk/\n\nIf you open it in Firefox, you will observe that a dialog box appears to save/open the file and the iframe disappears. But in Chrome, the iframe doesn't disappear. When I tried to run the code in debugger, the control never goes to the onLoad event handler in Chrome.\n",
