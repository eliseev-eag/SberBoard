  "body": "`receiveComponent => receiveElement` actually takes an element.\n\nThe following are also named as if they mount _another_ component, but perhaps it's \"necessary\" as they are inherited and exposed by user classes (to go with `componentWillMount` etc)? ... or is it just for clarity at call-sites perhaps. If that's true I guess the justification loops back to `receiveComponent` actually intended as being just `receive`.\n\n`mountComponent => mount`\n`mountComponentIntoNode => mountIntoNode`\n`updateComponent => update`\n`unmountComponent => unmount`\n\ncc @sebmarkbage @zpao \n",
