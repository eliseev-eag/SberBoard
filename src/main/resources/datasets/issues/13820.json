The app just crashes.\r\nIf it contains just text, the same error (\"...is a void element tag and must neither have children nor use dangerouslySetInnerHTML\") appears, but this time with componentDidCatch properly called.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/0042z5wrlp\r\nThe behavior is different when you change Comp1 with Comp2.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\ncomponentDidCatch should be called in both cases.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.5.2. \r\nIn 16.4.2 it worked correctly.",
