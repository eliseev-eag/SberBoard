  "body": "**What is the current behavior?**\r\nFrom react16 `unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer` execution order has been changed.\r\n\r\nI know it's an old API and `createPortal` has replaced it and I'm starting to switch to it in my codebase. But I'm still depends on some libraries that use the old API.\r\n\r\nSo, just for the matter of knowing what has change:\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/6yx2p61nzz\r\n\r\nI wrote in the link the order of which the functions has been executed in react15 and 16.\r\nAs you can see in react16 the `componentDidMount` of the `<App />` is calling before his children gets mounted and in react15 it's called only after.\r\n\r\nIs this behavior change intentional?\r\n",
