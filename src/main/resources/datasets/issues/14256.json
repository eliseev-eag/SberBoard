Get the Display Locking implementation into a state that can be used in a demo (@vmpstr)\r\n2. Add code to React to support Display Locking\r\n3. Build a demo that demonstrates the integration\r\n\r\nWe can use these to validate the design, debug it, and measure performance on a common example.\r\n",
