  "body": "Error boundries might help, if someone is using them, but if you're not using error boundaries we shouldn't ever attempt to unmount a single component instance more than once.\n\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/fxq44m0t/\n\nThe only reason it's not an infinite loop is that we eventually run out of stack space :P.  With good tail recursion in the JSVM, this could become an infinite loop.\n\nAnyway, this is more than a contrived example, because the ReactRouter+redux combination creates situations where this type of thing happens.\n",
