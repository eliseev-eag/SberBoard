  "body": "This is a documentation improvement request. \r\n\r\nCurrently https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html#tip-optimizing-performance-by-skipping-effects explains skipping a useEffect based on a state variable by showing the following code:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;\r\n}, [count]); // Only re-run the effect if count changes\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the following explanation:\r\n\r\n> In the example above, we pass [count] as the second argument. What does this mean? If the count is 5, and then our component re-renders with count still equal to 5, React will compare [5] from the previous render and [5] from the next render. Because all items in the array are the same (5 === 5), React would skip the effect. Thatâ€™s our optimization.\r\n\r\nHowever, this does not explain why an array is needed: it still needs to explain what happens when an array with more than one value is passed. Is `useEffect` bypassed when _all_ values are the same, or when _some_ values are the same?\r\n\r\n(and of course the answer to that question should be the PR that updates the documentation, not an issue comment =)",
