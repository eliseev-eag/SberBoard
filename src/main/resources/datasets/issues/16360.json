Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nAdd multiple versions of react-dom as deps from multiple referenced npm packages; not easily reproduceable w/fiddle\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nError on import, not on render, ideally including version numbers\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nreact-dom 16.9.0+16.8.4 in this case; all browsers",
