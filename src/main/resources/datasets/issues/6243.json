  "body": "Based on some discussions, this reverts a few commits that changed our SVG behavior to pass through all attributes to the node directly. After a lot of discussion that came in after the RC (see #6211), we mostly agree that while the move to pass through was a great effort and ultimately might be where we should go with attributes, it left us in an inconsistent state for our HTML and SVG behaviors. That's not awesome as there are already a number of things that must be learned for React and throwing in another inconsitency doesn't help. So we'll backpedal for now but still continue to provide full SVG support by going back to our previous whitelist and expanding it.\n\nThe list here was compiled with (a version of) https://gist.github.com/zpao/4f5ce1d96b11b8a70e07 which scrapes MDN for all of its SVG attributes.\n\nSome additional changes in here as an effort to reduce bytesize. Specifically, since there are a lot of things in SVG that need to be mapped, we're duplicating the keys a lot. We can take some shortcuts to build the config with code so I did that. I also replaced all the `null`s in our config with a zero. `null` was a placeholder value that we weren't using (only using it to check masks and it's 0 anyway for that).\n",
