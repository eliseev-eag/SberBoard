Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nAdd `create-react-class` to `package.json` and then run `yarn install` and the following warning is output:\r\n`create-react-class > fbjs > core-js@1.2.7: core-js@<2.6.8 is no longer maintained. Please, upgrade to core-js@3 or at least to actual version of core-js@2`\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nMaintained version of `core-js` is used\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n`create-react-class: 15.6.3` (current version available in npm)",
