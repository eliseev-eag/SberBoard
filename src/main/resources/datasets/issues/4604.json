  "body": "It seems that files with the extension .js can be required, but .jsx files cannot.\n\nThe following works fine:\n\n```\nvar HelloPage = require(\"./src/views/screens/hello.js\")\n```\n\nBut when I rename the file and the code to .jsx, it gives the exception \"Requiring unknown module \"./src/views/screens/hello.jsx\". If you are sure the module is there, try restarting the packager.\"\n\nRestarting didn't seem to help. Is this a problem with something in React Native?\n",
