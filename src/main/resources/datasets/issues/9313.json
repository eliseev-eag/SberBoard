  "body": "The [custom element spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#custom-elements), combined with the [document.createElement](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-document-createelement) spec explain that in order to create a DOM element as a [customized built-in element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#customized-built-in-element), you should call document.createElement with an object as the second parameter. Customized builtin elements are a type of custom element that allow you to extend native DOM elements. However, React currently provides the second parameter to `document.createElement` as a string instead of an object. As far as I can tell, that is just a bug.\r\n\r\nI am not sure of the full history of the custom elements spec, and so it might be possible that the spec used to say the second argument to createElement should be a string. I'm also not sure if anybody is depending on the behavior being like it is right now, or if this change would be considered a breaking change or not for React. My thoughts are that it is a bug fix, but I may be lacking some context here.",
