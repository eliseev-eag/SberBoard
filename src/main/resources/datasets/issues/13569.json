But in a [follow up PR](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11264/files#diff-24152ba0b2ac251decb6a12f41bdf116L211) we just delete the comment but don't remove the `isUnbatchingUpdates`. I don't know why we remove the comment, seems the weird case which the before comment said doesn't be solved in this PR.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI try to remove `isUnbatchingUpdates` and use `!isUnbatchingUpdates` instead just like before we did. But encounter many tests fails(I thought just few tests would fails before try).\r\n\r\nSo, could you give some clarifications about this? Do we still need this now? Thanks!\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nmaster branch\r\n",
