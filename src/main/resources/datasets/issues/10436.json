  "body": "This PR consolidates the two SSR reference pages into one page. Since the streaming render methods were recently moved from `react-dom/node-stream` to `react-dom/server`, it makes sense to document them in the same place as the other methods on `react-dom/server`.\r\n\r\nI also corrected a factual error in the doc about `data-reactid`, which is no longer added in React 16.\r\n\r\nThis is a documentation-only change. Thanks!",
