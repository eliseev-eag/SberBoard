Using it as a codename now can make it more difficult to use later \"for real\". As we know, codenames leak and get a life of their own.\r\n\r\nIs `react-interactions` the perfect name? No. But that's the point. If we started using it as a codename, let's keep it that way. And I guess it's OK to put windowing stuff there too until we figure out another place for it.",
