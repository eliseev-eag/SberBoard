  "body": "In order to solve [this issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3131), which ended up raising [this bug](https://github.com/WebReflection/ie8/issues/29), and since [the future version of React won't support IE8](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/01/12/discontinuing-ie8-support.html) but developers stuck in 0.14 would like to keep using it and also move on with the browser, this push aim is to resolve conflicts with patched IE8 environments, either via my [ie8.js](https://github.com/WebReflection/ie8) library or others, so that React 0.14 won't wrongly assume that if there is an `addEventListener`, that's what should be used as if it's native.\n\nThis PR has been pushed together with [the following fbjs one](https://github.com/facebook/fbjs/pull/126).\n\nI hope this change will be considered small enough to land separately in these two repositories.\n",
