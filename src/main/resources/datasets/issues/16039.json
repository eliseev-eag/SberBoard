  "body": "(an alternative to https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15816/)\r\n\r\nThere are usecases where multiple renderers need to operate inside a single `act()` scope.\r\n- `ReactDOM.render` being used inside another component tree. The parent component will be rendered using `ReactTestRenderer.create` for a snapshot test or something.\r\n- a ReactDOM instance interacting with a ReactTestRenderer instance (like for the new devtools)\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the way the acting sigils operate to allow for this. It keeps 2 booleans, one attached to React, one attached to the renderer. `act()` changes these values, and the workloop reads them to decide which warning to trigger.\r\n\r\n(I also renamed `shouldWarnUnactedUpdates` to `warnsIfNotActing`)\r\n\r\n",
