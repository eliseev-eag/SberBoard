  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nA bug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen a `ReactDOM.createPortal` is used in conjunction with a container in another window, the components do not respond to user input until after `setState` or `forceUpdate` are called on the _parent_ component of the portal.\r\n\r\nI've produced a [CodePen demonstrating the issue](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/yKYYzB).\r\n\r\n1. Click \"Open a Portal\" – a new window appears with a pair of buttons.\r\n2. Click either button in the new window – nothing happens.\r\n3. Click the \"Hack\" button in the parent window (which simply calls `setState({})` on the parent).\r\n4. Note that the buttons in the new window now work as expected.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI expect the components in the new window to be interactive.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.2.0\r\nReactDOM 16.2.0\r\n\r\nI've tested this in Safari and Chrome on Mac.",
