  "body": "I ran into an issue where I had an event handler that called `setState` by passing in a function and accessing `e.target.value` inside that function. It seems that Reacts synthetic events are \"garbage collected\" after the event handler has finished executing, which gave me an error when I tried to access `value` of `undefined` (since all properties were removed from the event object).\n\nThis is fine, and easy to fix by destructuring the event as in the argument (`({target: {value}}) => this.setState(...)` instead of `e => this.setState(...)`), but it should probably be documented.\n",
