  "body": "We explicitly don't want to shim this, since things can go wrong (such as memory leaks) and we don't use the return value.\r\n\r\nWe can probably even drop the IE path now since we don't support it. Not sure if that'll be a true breaking change though.\r\n\r\nWe still need to integrate with the TimeSlice mechanism internally. I think we can do that at the error guard boundary instead since we invoke all our event handlers through that guard.\r\n\r\nHowever, since that is also used for error boundaries, it might also cause those to play into the TimeSlicer. Is that what we want anyway?",
