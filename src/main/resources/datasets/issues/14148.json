  "body": "`yarn build core,dom` -> `yarn build react/index react-dom`\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n`yarn build core,dom-client` -> `yarn build react/,dom/index`\r\n\r\nI've been frustrated that I can never guess what arguments `yarn build` expects so always end up building everything.\r\n\r\nFirst, I improved the argument parsing a bit so that you don't have to separate the bundle names by commas. But commas still work. This ensures that `yarn build core dom` includes DOM.\r\n\r\nIt also ensures that spaces like `yarn build core, dom` doesn't build EVERYTHING by becoming an empty entry which matches everything.\r\n\r\nI also got rid of label in bundles config. These follow a fairly arbitrary naming convention so I can never guess.\r\n\r\nInstead I just use the name from npm entry name using fuzzy search.\r\n\r\nThere are some cases where this is weird. E.g. `yarn build react` builds everything since everything is called something with `react` in it.\r\n\r\nThere is one special case. The entry gets appended with `/index.js` at the end.\r\n\r\nThat allows to build things like `yarn build react/` to only build isomorphic. Or `yarn build react-dom/index` to exclude the server renderers where as `yarn build react-dom` includes server renderers.\r\n",
