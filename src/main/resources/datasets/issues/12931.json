  "body": "**what is the change?:**\r\nIn a recent PR we were referencing some global variables and storing\r\nlocal references to them.\r\n\r\nTo make things more natural, we co-opted the original name of the global\r\nfor our local reference. To make this work with Flow, we get the\r\noriginal reference from 'window.requestAnimationFrame' and assign it to\r\n'const requestAnimationFrame'.\r\n\r\nSometimes React is used in an environment where 'window' is not defined\r\n- in that case we need to use something else, or hide the 'window'\r\nreference somewhere.\r\n\r\nWe opted to use 'global' thinking that Babel transforms would fill that\r\nin with the proper thing.\r\n\r\nBut for some of our fixtures we are not doing that transform on the\r\nbundle.\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nI want to unbreak this on master and then investigate more about what we\r\nshould do to fix this.\r\n\r\nWould like to land this quick fix but ultimately would like to avoid using the confusing 'localRequestAnimationFrame' naming.\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nrun `yarn build` and open the fixtures.\r\n\r\n**issue:**\r\n\r\nfixes #12930 \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12930",
