  "body": "I have a suggestion where I am not really sure whether this functionality already exists but I think it does not yet. Also I am not really sure whether the proposed mechanism would indeed improve the performance of react.\n\nAccording to my understanding the virtual-dom is created by reactjs on application load. If applications are large the virtual dom creating can consume some time. If the virtual dom could be provided by the server already similar to init ram images used in linux the init performance could possibly be increased. In some cases the init dom 'image' (probably provided as json) would be static but there might be cases where this does not work. There would be plenty of options of how to prepare this on server side.\n\nBut if indeed the transmission of a virtual dom image would be slower than creating it from scratch on client side it does not make sense. In case it depends on network speed it could also be an option that the client starts to build the dom and abandons the virtual dom creation process when the image is received from the server. In the other case the request would be canceled.\n\nI hope this makes sense. I am not a user of react but in a conference discussion with developers that use react the idea was accepted that is why I now propose it here.\n",
