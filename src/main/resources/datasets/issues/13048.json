Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe possibility of creating portals for custom renderers should be exposed to renderer developers by making it available in `react-reconciler`.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n- `react` 16.4.0\r\n- `react-reconciler` 0.11.0\r\n- Chrome on Windows\r\n- Non-public Reconciler\r\n- Never worked in any React version\r\n\r\nI can write the corresponding patch if the maintainers are ok with the change.",
