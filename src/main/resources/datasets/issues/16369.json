  "body": "__Builds on top of #16352 and #16359__\r\n\r\nIf we get an insertion after a boundary, that has not yet been hydrated, we take our best guess at which state the HTML is showing.\r\n\r\nisSuspenseInstancePending means that we're still waiting for more server HTML before we can hydrate. This should mean that we're showing the fallback state.\r\n\r\nisSuspenseInstanceFallback means that we want to client render something. That most likely means that the server was unable to render and is displaying a fallback state in this slot.\r\n\r\nAdds tests to ensure that dehydrated components don't consider the force flag set by suspense list. I.e. we should be able to hydrate something that is already showing content even though insertions are forced into fallback state.",
