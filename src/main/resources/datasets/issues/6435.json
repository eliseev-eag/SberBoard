  "body": "We are implementing unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer to use custom components. So Some things discussed during the initial PR would be pretty fantastic. Specifically these things.\n\n1) Debugging structure. E.g. tooltips shouldn't show up in the top level of React DevTools but rather in their respective subtrees.\n2) Automatic clean up if the parent tree is unmounted.\n3) Event bubbling.\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/pull/3640#issuecomment-92533429\n\nAre these on the back log? I didn't see any issues about them. And it looks like all unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer is doing at the moment is passing in the proper context.\n",
