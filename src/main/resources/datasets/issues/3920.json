  "body": "Internally, there has been serious discussion about exposing an API that allows data reads and writes to be tracked, as an alternative to the Observe API proposed a couple months back.  This new API allows React to automatically track a component's dependencies, thereby allowing React to efficiently re-render a component when one of the dependencies changes.  Usage is a little more intuitive (and a little more flexible) than the Observable API (also more intuitive if you are using Observables, see https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3858, so it's a win-win), but since the data bindings are tracked automatically, it's a little less explicit.  For anyone following along at home, take a look at the unit test in this commit for example usage.\n\nPosting this commit/PR mostly to continue/inform the discussion.  We aren't ready to merge this quite yet, as the final disposition of this API proposal is still undecided.\n\nFixes: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3858\n",
