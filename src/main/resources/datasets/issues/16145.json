  "body": "Adds two new profiling features to Scheduler.\r\n\r\n## Sample-based approach\r\n\r\nThe main feature is a way to read the current state of the Scheduler from a worker, using a shared array buffer. The shared array buffer contains (only in the profiling and development builds)\r\n\r\n- the priority at which Scheduler is currently running (or 0 if it's not)\r\n- the size of the queue\r\n- the id of the currently running task (if applicable)\r\n- a unique \"run id\" per block (if applicable)\r\n\r\nRegarding the last point each synchronous block of Scheduler work is given a unique run ID. This is different than a task ID because a single task will have more than one run if it yields with a continuation.\r\n\r\nThe worker thread can use this information to construct a flamegraph. The advantage of the sample-based approach is that it scales in proportion to the available resources — if the CPU slows down, the sample rate slows down accordingly.\r\n\r\n## Event-based approach\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage of the sample-based approach is that it doesn't during the very first part of page initialization, before the worker has initialized.\r\n\r\nTo address this problem, there's a separate feature to write to a log of events: `startLoggingProfilerEvents` and `stopLoggingProfilerEvents`.\r\n\r\n`stopLoggingProfilerEvents` returns a typed, 32-bit integer array buffer (though not a shared array buffer). The log conforms to a custom event format. A profiler can then convert this log into a flamegraph.\r\n\r\nAn array buffer is used so that the log can be sent to a worker thread via `postMessage` and the structured clone algorithm.\r\n\r\nThe test suite works by printing a text representation of a Scheduler flamegraph. Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n!!! Main thread              │          ██\r\nTask 2 [User-blocking]       │        ░░░░██████\r\nTask 1 [Normal]              │  ████████░░░░░░░░██████\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Both approaches combined\r\n\r\nThe suggested approach is to use the event log during page start up, then switch to the sample-based approach once the profiler worker is ready.",
