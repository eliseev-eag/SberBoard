  "body": "I think that the [React tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) has some significant problems and my question to maintainers is whether there is an appetite to overhaul it. If there is, I will take the effort to do so.\r\n\r\nI think that one big problem is that it does not separate the tic-tac-toe example from overall conceptual discussion. Adding disparate non-runnable examples muddles the focus of the tutorial. It should be split up, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nAs for tic-tac-toe example itself, there are many structural design issues. Probably the most glaring of these is the repetition in the render function of the Board class: `{this.renderSquare(0)}`, `{this.renderSquare(1)}`, etc. There is no hint of how one could use a more programmatic approach. Another issue is the use of `this` everywhere, which very often makes things harder to interpret and introduces bugs -- `this` is not always the same, etc..\r\n\r\nI think there should be both an ES5 and an ES6 version (with fewer arrow functions), (and/or something in between?), as this is meant to be a React tutorial example, not an ES6 tutorial. Many people are not familiar with a lot of ES6 syntax, but for those who are, there is also a bit of a tendency to, er, \"overuse\" arrow functions in the tic-tac-toe example. While ES6 is useful to know, one cannot teach by flooding the student with too many concepts at once.\r\n\r\nHere is the current example on the site:\r\nhttps://codepen.io/ericnakagawa/pen/ALxakj\r\n\r\nHere are my current versions: (with a Connect 4 option...):\r\nhttps://codepen.io/Agamemnus/pen/MppMby -- ES6 (plus JSX).\r\nhttps://codepen.io/Agamemnus/pen/LWyaLz -- ES5, I think (plus JSX).",
