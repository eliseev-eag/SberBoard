But since #14111 landed, it also determines if the dispatcher and implementation are included in the bundle.\r\n\r\nWe're using hooks in www, so I've switched the feature flag to `true` in the www build.\r\n\r\n(Alternatively, we could have two feature flags: one for the implementation and dispatcher, and one for exposing the API on the React package.)",
