  "body": "I want to learn more about performance in React, so I'm trying to get a sense of exactly how and when React manipulates the DOM.\r\n\r\nStepping through the source (or inspecting in the devtools profiler), I can see that `scheduleFlush` is finally called when React triggers an update to the DOM. I understand how reconciliation works, but I'm looking for the actual mechanics (read: specific line of code) where React appends new elements to the DOM (e.g. `rootElement.appendChild(newElement)`). Can someone point me in the right direction?\r\n\r\nI asked this on the #reactjs freenode, but didn't get the response I was looking for. Thanks in advance!",
