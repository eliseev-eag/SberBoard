  "body": "Hello there,\n\nI am playing with React transition\n\nI noticed that the **-enter** classe is added only after the element has been inserted into the dom.\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/addons/transitions/ReactTransitionableChild.js#L147-L150\n\nI thought the active class was applied when the component was mounted into the dom.\n\nHere is a small demo:  http://jsfiddle.net/437Us/1/\nI am using componentWillUpdate to make sure the class is applied directly. If you remove it, and use the same \ntransition mechanism on a more complex layout  sometime you will see the page flashing into the screen before the transition starts\n",
