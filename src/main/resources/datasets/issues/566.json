  "body": "We've hit a couple bugs in prod now where keys are supposed to be distinct but aren't, which causes React to throw errors and render nothing.\n\nIt would be nice if React could instead warn and render all the components anyway (perhaps adding some suffix to make the keys unique) or render only one of the components with the same ID. Both of these seem preferable to completely dying (though maybe this is just our fault for not properly having our JS error reporting figured outâ€¦).\n",
