  "body": "This adds a reconciliation bailout condition asserting that context has not changed, which fixes the other half of @ryanflorence's discovery in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4218.\n\nFor those following along, the first half of this bug was fixed in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/4221.  The assertion that there may be a bug in the reconciler turned out to be due to a bug in jest: https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/429 (if you're bored and want to have fun, see if you can identify the 'fix' in this diff that avoids that bug).  But I digress...\n\nThis diff results in a divergence between dev and prod behavior (specifically, more components will rerender more often in dev) because we no longer bail out of reconciliation in dev mode due to https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/3516/files causing there to always be a context variable change.  This means not only that we should start running React unit tests in both dev and prod mode, but also has ramifications for developers who only test in dev before shipping their components to prod.\n\n@sebmarkbage @spicyj \n",
