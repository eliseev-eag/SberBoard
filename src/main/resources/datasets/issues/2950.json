  "body": "We use quite a bit of inline transforms in our components, and I've recently encountered that these transforms are not updated in IE after the component is mounted. So on mounting, the component receive the correct transform styling; but it remains unchanged through subsequent update cycles.\n\nThey only update if the component has a unique key for each update cycle. They do not update for no-key components or components with static keys.\n\nI've verified that other styling properties seem to update fine (i.e. opacity).\n",
