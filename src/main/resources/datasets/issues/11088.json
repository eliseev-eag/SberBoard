  "body": "Just dumping these items here since I want to close the 16 umbrella.\r\n\r\n- [x] Convert OSS repo to ES6 modules (does not block release; nice-to-have follow up)\r\n- [x] Move https://gist.github.com/gaearon/9a4d54653ae9c50af6c54b4e0e56b583 to docs and update fb.me/react-polyfills to point there\r\n- [x] Fix RN crash in DEV https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10518\r\n- [x] It's worth looking into existing `ssr error` entries in the attribute table. They might mean bugs.\r\n- [x] Decide: after flat bundles, how does one create a custom Fiber renderer? (doesn't block final, but ideally do for final. internal PR WIP at FB, @gaearon or @bvaughn has context)\r\n- [ ] Update \"unknown property\" warning documentation for new behavior in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10399 (currently the warning points to the blog post https://fb.me/react-attribute-behavior)\r\n- [ ] Update crossorigin doc and warning to clarify thrower/catcher semantics (@gaearon @bvaughn @sebmarkbage)\r\n- [ ] Add Closure Compiler with ADVANCED and deal with mangling properly (does not block release; nice-to-have follow up)\r\n- [ ] Whitelist/blacklist warnings\r\n- [ ] Add yellow box for warnings https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7360 (could make opt-in in minor release) (@bvaughn ) [let's make this opt-in in 16.x, on by default in 17]\r\n- [ ] RN: [what is this?] Make sure instanceProps in ReactNativeComponentTree doesn't leak. (@sebmarkbage, @bvaughn)\r\n- [ ] RN: ensure we keep all important invariants (such as that text must be wrapped in `<Text>`) (Dan: I moved this back to blockers because shipping without invariants and adding them later will be painful)\r\n- [ ] Decide how to handle the situation where a container has its content changed outside of React. Right now we warn for this, and it also either silently fails or throws a cryptic error. Should we also throw an error? Or can/should we fix this behavior to match previous React? See comments on https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10294 (@flarnie)\r\n- [ ] Consider logging caught errors immediately rather than during commit (@gaearon @bvaughn)\r\n- [ ] Improve component stack usability (issue #10461 / PR #10484)\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10863 SSR should probably lowercase attributes in HTML namespace. PR: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11110.\r\n",
