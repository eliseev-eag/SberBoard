  "body": "Follow up of #9640\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the injection of `ReactDOMEventListener` from `ReactBrowserEventEmitter`. Instead, the required initialization will happen directly in `ReactDOMInjection`.\r\n\r\nThis injection was (probably) originally implemented for React Native but never used, so we can clean it up.\r\n\r\n@spicyj I played around with the test cases in the `dom` fixtures. Seems to work fine! I only had to move the \"initialization\" to `ReactDOMEventListener.setHandleTopLevel()` to `ReactDOMInjection`. Finding out that I had to update the exports in `ReactDOMFiber.js` as well took me a little longer - I ran the `record-tests` script, saw it was all red and could not find a way to see the error output (hence the second commit) üôà.    \r\n\r\nRunning the build job did (very minimally) update `scripts/rollup/results.json`. I've attached the file to the PR but feel free to remove it/tell me to remove it.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me if there's anything else I can do üëç ",
