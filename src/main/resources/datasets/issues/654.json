  "body": "`&lt;script>` is a bit hard to use right now.\n- If you have a `{...}` then it's going to start interpolating. And you are bound to have whenever you use `if`, `function` ... Workaround: you can wrap it inside of an interpolated string `{'if (true) { ... }'}`\n- If you have any `'` or `\"` it's going to output the html encoded version and Javascript is going to throw a parsing exception.\n\nIn order to workaround those two issues the best way I found is to use dangerouslySetInnerHTML and use ES6 backtick in order to have multi-line strings.\n\n``` javascript\n<script dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: `\n  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n  })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n  ga('send', 'pageview');\n`}} />\n```\n\nWe should probably make it easier, it's quite a pain to use right now.\n",
