  "body": "Hi,\n\nWe'd like to separate the builds of https://github.com/stevoland/react-bootstrap from the source and at the same time move to an org and https://github.com/reactjs looks like a good place.\n\nI'd like repos for `react-bootstrap-bower`, `react-bootstrap-npm`. I'd like to move the source over at a later date but I'm too sad about losing my stars :)\n\nThanks!\n",
