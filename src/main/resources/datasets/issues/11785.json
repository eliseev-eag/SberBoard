  "body": "I just came across a warning while attempting to pass the attribute `readonly` to an input (which is rendered within a 3rd party component, https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/).\r\n\r\n> Warning: Unknown DOM property readonly. Did you mean readOnly?\r\n\r\n`readonly` is a [valid input attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure where this error is coming from, but I'm assuming it's in **React** as the error seems pretty generic.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to get past this error, as my component won't get the attribute I'm trying to pass to it. ðŸ˜¢ ",
