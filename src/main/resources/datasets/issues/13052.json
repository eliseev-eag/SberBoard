  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nI'm not really sure whether this is a really a bug - maybe the React team could examine whether the following demo behaves as intended or not.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nPlease check the following demo:\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/1wvqbkp3/\r\n\r\nIt outputs the current time two times.\r\nThe first time output is updated each second.\r\nBut the second isn't.\r\n\r\nNote: Please be aware this is just a short abstract demo to show the issue in as few line of code as possible. It's not about implementing clocks or proper state handling or proper side effect handling or setState vs. forceUpdate or React design patterns in general, etc.\r\nNobody wants to implement  components in this extremely ugly way - the demo is just there to show the issue without any other stuff.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would expect the second time output to be also updated each second.\r\nIn the second line of that JS-Fiddle demo you can easily switch the UI library from 'react' to 'preact', 'inferno', 'dio' or 'nerv' to see that they behave the way I would have been expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact v16.4.1 / Windows 10  - React 15.x behaves like the current React version\r\n",
