  "body": "The way it's currently set up is incorrect.\r\nIt's not downright broken but can blow up in our faces later.\r\n\r\nSpecifically it currently uses `ReactFiberTreeReflection` which brings in a copy of some parts of the reconciler. Such as `ReactInstanceMap`.\r\n\r\nHowever it also depends on `ReactDOM` which has its own `ReactInstanceMap`. So, for example, `ReactFiberTreeReflection.isMounted()` would not give accurate results. We didn't bump into this just because we only use `ReactFiberTreeReflection.findCurrentFiberUsingSlowPath()` which is stateless.\r\n\r\nWe can fix this by forbidding `TestUtils` to bundle its own reconciler. If there's more secret stuff that should be exposed from `ReactDOM` for that to work, so be it.\r\n\r\nOr we could separate `ReactFiberTreeReflection.findCurrentFiberUsingSlowPath()` into a stateless helper that's safe to share. That seems easier.",
