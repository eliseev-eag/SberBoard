Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n1. Go to https://codepen.io/anon/pen/byqZKd\r\n2. Click on one of the input fields in one of the sections.\r\n3. Click \"next\" couple of times.\r\n4. Go to dev tools, make a memory snapshot and search for \"MyHeader\" - there will be way too many of them.\r\n\r\nIf you don't click on any input fields, in any of the sections, then there will be no leak.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact >=16.6.1",
