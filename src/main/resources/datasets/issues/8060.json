Check http://redux.js.org/docs/Glossary.html for inspiration.)\r\n- [ ] Troubleshooting (there are ~5 common issues we should explain right away, like wrong element casing, not loaded DOM container, missing React in scope, etc. See http://redux.js.org/docs/Troubleshooting.html for inspiration)\r\n- [ ] Accessibility \r\n- [ ] @madhug Manipulating Children (Using `cloneElement` and `Children` https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6942)\r\n- [ ] \"Portals\" (useful for modals)\r\n- [ ] Animation with React Motion\r\n- [ ] @jamesknelson Routing (no need to use React Router here, just show how to use `setState` with HTML5 history API and point to RR as a component-based API for it once v4 is out)\r\n- [ ] AJAX (just show how to use `fetch()` in lifecycles, mention cancellation issues)\r\n- [x] Integrating with non-React code (show how to wrap jQuery plugin in React, how to expose React component as a Backbone view, and how to consume Backbone models) https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9316#pullrequestreview-30403084\r\n- [ ] ReactPerf should include a basic usage example, not just reference (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6174)\r\n- [ ] Snapshot testing (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7431)\r\n- [ ] Publishing a Component (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7882)\r\n\r\nIf somebody wants to work on this please comment here and let's figure out a plan.\r\nHelp wanted!\r\n",
