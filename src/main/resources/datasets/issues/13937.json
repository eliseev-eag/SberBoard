I discovered this while looking into the code for writing the types in https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/29990.\r\n\r\nThe following code demonstrates that it works (both the rendering and the `console.log(ref)`):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Test = React.memo(class extends React.Component {\r\n  render () {\r\n    return <h1>TEST</h1>\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(\r\n  <Test ref={ref => { console.log(ref) }}/>,\r\n  document.appendChild(document.createElement('div'))\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nOnly functional components are documented as valid arguments, so either class components should also be documented as supported, or React.memo should reject the argument.",
