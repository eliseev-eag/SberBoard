  "body": "Switches Scheduler's priority queue implementation (for both tasks and timers) to an array-based min binary heap.\r\n\r\nThis replaces the naive linked-list implementation that was left over from the queue we once used to schedule React roots. A list was arguably fine when it was only used for roots, since the total number of roots is usually small, and is only 1 in the common case of a single-page app.\r\n\r\nSince Scheduler is now used for many types of JavaScript tasks (e.g. including timers), the total number of tasks can be much larger.\r\n\r\nHeaps are the standard way to implement priority queues. Insertion is O(1) in the average case (append to the end) and O(log n) in the worst. Deletion is O(log n). Peek is O(1).",
