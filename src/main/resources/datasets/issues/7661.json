  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\r\n\r\nreporting a bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI'm working on a project which employs React as the view layer. I have a rather large tree of components. I ran into a bug the other day where the event which triggers click handler which ultimately unmounts the tree continues running rogue in React's DOM after the thing is unmounted and triggers other handlers. There's a simple workaround. I used `event.preventDefault` to avert any future crises.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\r\n\r\nI'm sure you can repro this with a little luck, enough components and no event management in your event handlers.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nNo event handlers should be triggerable after unmounting.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nbrowser: Chrome Version 52.0.2743.116 (64-bit)\r\nos: Mac OS X 10.11.3\r\nReact version: 0.14.8\r\n\r\nfiddle with (failed) repro:\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/68075/\r\n",
