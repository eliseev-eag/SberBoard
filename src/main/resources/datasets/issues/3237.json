  "body": "This may have been filed already, but I did a quick search and couldn't find it. Please close if that's the the case.\n\nA React component's reusability as a view is highly limited without strong ties in with CSS. Currently, passing className to a component  eg `<Component className='css-class' />` does nothing unless explicitly consumed by the the implementation of `Component`. This requires that each implementation to read the immutable prop (possibly use the React css addon) to append the class to the top level DOM or to explicitly set the `style`. As a result, this creates a lot of code duplication for components that need the flexibility to be used in multiple contexts.\n\nWhile, my understanding of the internals may be a bit lacking, I believe that this feature would mesh well with JSX since `className` and `style` are already protected keywords. Certainly let me know if I am missing something obvious as to why this would be a bad feature.\n",
