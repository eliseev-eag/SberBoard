  "body": "It would be awesome if JSX parser errors wouldn't just end up in the terminal, but if it would actually output (valid) code that would throw the error on load on the client instead, it would make it virtually transparent that JSX is being used.\n\nA simple solution would be to simply (only) output the error message as-is with file+line baked in. I imagine that with some source map trickery we could even make it look as if the browser threw the error, with correct source and location.\n",
