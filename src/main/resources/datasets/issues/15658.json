  "body": "This PR introduces the concept of tracking which Fiber(s) schedule work with React. Tracked Fibers are called \"updaters\" and are exposed to DevTools via a `memoizedUpdaters` property on the `ReactFiberRoot`. The implementation of this feature follows a vaguely similar approach as interaction tracing, but does not require reference counting since there is no subscriptions API.\r\n\r\nThis change is in support of a new DevTools Profiler feature (https://github.com/bvaughn/react-devtools-experimental/pull/269) that shows which Fiber(s) scheduled the selected commit.\r\n\r\nAll changes have been gated behind a new feature flag, `enableUpdaterTracking`, which is enabled for Profiling builds by default. We also only track updaters when DevTools has been detected, to avoid doing unnecessary work.",
