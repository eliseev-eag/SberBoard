  "body": "Thanks to the renaming in #13165, I noticed a bunch of cases where we could accidentally concatenate `null` to a warning message if the stack was missing.\r\n\r\nI changed `getCurrentFiberStackInDevOrNull` to always return a string, and renamed it to `getCurrentFiberStackInDev`. This fixed existing callsites that *already relied* on it being a string (which wasn't always the case). Then I removed a few `|| ''` that now became unnecessary.\r\n\r\nI also changed the \"isomorphic\" type of `ReactDebugCurrentFrame.getStackAddendum()` to be tighter since we know both SSR and Fiber implementation return a string now. This is a bit optimistic because in practice `ReactDebugCurrentFrame` could be from an old React version that didn't have the `|| ''` isomorphic fallback, and its `getStackAddendum` could be pointing to another renderer that has a version before this change (e.g. maybe something like React 16.4 + React DOM 16.5 + ReactDOMServer 16.4). In that case you could potentially see the `null` bug in the warning message. I don't think this matters because (a) we recommend to keep versions in sync, (b) we *already have* this bug in a bunch of places, and I'd prefer tightening it up now than worrying about what happens in an edge case where you mix past and present versions.",
