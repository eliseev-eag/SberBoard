  "body": "As discussed in #6015, we plan to add a new build configuration that does _not_ have the `__DEV__` overhead but that comes with the new `ReactPerf` enabled.\n\nThis means that developer warnings, etc, will need to be gated by `__DEV__`, but the component tree (#6549) and some other events (e.g. #6612) will need to be gated by `__PROFILE__`.\n\nI’m curious how this could be implemented. Right now our system is simple:\n### Current System\n#### Variables\n- `__DEV__ = (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production')`\n#### Development Build (any `NODE_ENV` except `'production'`)\n- `__DEV__` is `true`\n#### Production Build (`NODE_ENV` is `'production'`)\n- `__DEV__` is `false`\n\nAs you can see, if `process.env.NODE_ENV` is omitted, we assume `__DEV__` mode. This is a sensible assumption, and not the one we want to change, as most projects today don’t specify anything as `NODE_ENV` in development, and we don’t want them to suddenly lose all developer warnings.\n\nTherefore, I propose the following new system:\n### Proposed System\n#### Variables\n- `__DEV__ = (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'profile' && process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production')`\n- `__PROFILE__ = (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'profile'`)\n#### Development Build (any `NODE_ENV` except `'profile'` or `'production'`)\n- `__DEV__` is `true`\n- `__PROFILE__` is `true`\n#### Profile Build (`NODE_ENV` is `'profile'`)\n- `__DEV__` is `false`\n- `__PROFILE__` is `true`\n#### Production Build (`NODE_ENV` is `'production'`)\n- `__DEV__` is `false`\n- `__PROFILE__` is `false`\n\nThis would let us have three separate build configurations. We can use the same pattern in other `fbjs` projects as well, if desired. I would say it’s unlikely we’d ever want to add a separate fourth configuration so this should cover all our needs.\n\nAny thoughts why this would be a bad idea? Should I implement this in `fbjs`?\n\ncc @facebook/react-core \n",
