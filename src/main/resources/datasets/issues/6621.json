  "body": "The React DevTools are great, but get convoluted when using community libraries at times (e.g., react-router, redux, coflux). Could there be a blessed API that allows components to not show in the Dev Tools? Something simple like:\n\n``` js\nconst Component = () => { ... };\nComponent.devTools = false;\n```\n\nWhen using the React DevTools, I generally just want to see my components and their business logic. Not things like `<RouterContext />` or `<Provider />`.\n\nIt is helpful to see those things at times though, so I don't imagine these components become completely opaque. But probably have a checkbox in DevTools (that defaults off), to show all components.\n\nAssuming this is something you guys are too busy to do, if you like the concept, I can work on implementation.\n",
