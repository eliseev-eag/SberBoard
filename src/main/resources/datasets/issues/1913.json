  "body": "As first discussed in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/1558#issuecomment-48955852 .\n\nUse case: Application code is in `app.js`; react code is in file `ui.jsx`. In development, both are included along with `JSXTransformer`. There's no way for `app.js` to reliably reference components defined in `ui.jsx`. (In production, JSX is first translated, then all JS files are combined/compiled together, so this is not an issue.)\n\nAs noted in the above comment, there are workarounds.\n",
