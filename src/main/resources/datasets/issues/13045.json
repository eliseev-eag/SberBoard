  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nFeature request\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhole app unmounts on uncaught errors.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt'd be good to just unmount the affected tree.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact@16\r\n\r\n\r\nHi guys, I feel like the \"new\" error handling approach on React 16 is too harsh for our App. We have plenty of plugin \"entrypoints\" for external React components that we consider error prone. While having an ErrorBoundary for each is a solution, I'd prefer that only the affected component tree to be  unmounted in case some of these components, or even internal components spits an error.\r\n\r\nA way to achieve this with the new error handling system would be to:\r\n\r\n0. This behavior could be a opt-in or out defined on a component up in the tree, something like a class variable  `supressErrors = true`.\r\n1. Flag the component that threw the error.\r\n2. Re-render the whole tree.\r\n3. Do not render flagged components.\r\n\r\nThe effect would be like a default `ErrorBoundary` wrapping every component down the tree where the boundary just spits `null` instead of crashing the whole app.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",
