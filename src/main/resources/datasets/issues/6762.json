  "body": "I've tested the new Perf tools on one of the screens in one app I'm working on and it works great :)\n\nOne thing I wanted also on the old one Perf tools was to be able to check whether the Perf tools are started or stopped, so basically exposing `ReactDebugTool`'s `isProfiling` variable. My use for that is that I have a keyboard shortcut (in development) bound to start/stop the Perf tools and currently I'm forced to maintain such a variable myself to know whether to start or stop (which gets out of sync if I start/stop the perf tools without the keyboard shortcut).\n\nIf you don't think it's worthwhile to expose `isProfiling` feel free to close this issue.\n",
