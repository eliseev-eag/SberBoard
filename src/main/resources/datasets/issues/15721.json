There is a feature called \"Minimal Download Strategy\" (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/general-development/minimal-download-strategy-overview). This feature overrides the document.addEventListener method and remembers all listeners. When the user navigates to another site, alle listeners will be removed. React don't know about the missing events, so all user inputs don't work anymore.\r\nWith the new method React should add all event listeners again.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nVersion: 16.8.6\r\nBrowsers: all\r\nOS: all\r\n",
