  "body": "I am trying to test my script by programatically triggering onChange on my class. But it doesnt seem to work on IE8. Kindly advice how to proceed.\r\n\r\nI created this jsfiddle to show that : https://jsfiddle.net/9gzej3u5/4/\r\n\r\nThe top part shows a typical reactjs code wherein values typed in an input field automatically appears in a separate DOM element.\r\n\r\nThe bottom part is the code wherein I try to programatically set the value on the reactjs's input field and trigger a change event. \r\n\r\nIf the jsfiddle above is execute in a Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, the code works. If it is executed on an IE8 (for example), it fails.\r\n\r\nKindly advice how to programmatically an onChange event.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nFranz",
