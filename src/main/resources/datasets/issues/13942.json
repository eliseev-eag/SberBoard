  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nCurrently, if I want a component to be a [fully uncontrolled component](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html#recommendation-fully-uncontrolled-component-with-a-key), a `key` attribute is assigned from the outer/parent component in JSX. Then, `Inner` will be recreated every time, the key changes.\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Outer extends Component {\r\n  ...\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return <Inner key={this.props.user.id} />\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nWhy should `Outer` have to know, that the inner comp (here `Emailnput`) is a fully controlled component and what is designated as the `key` attribute?\r\nIMO it would make sense, if `Inner` could decide that itself to have better encapsulation.\r\n\r\nIs it possible, that `Inner` could programmatically set its key attribute itself? Maybe as a static property similar to the way implemented with `defaultProps`?\r\n```\r\nexport interface Props<Props> {\r\n    user: User;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Inner extends Component {\r\n  ...\r\n  static key = user.id;\r\n\r\n  render() { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n",
