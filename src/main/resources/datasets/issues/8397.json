  "body": "We considered doing it earlier but settled on shipping just Object.assign, Promise and fetch polyfills by default.\r\n\r\nI'd like to reconsider adding a polyfill.io scripts to HTML as too many people rely on ES6 features without realizing they need polyfills. And using polyfill.io means it's easy to opt out too if you know what you're doing.\r\n\r\nWe should only include ES6 polyfills, and specifically exclude Object.assign, Promise, and fetch because we already have them.
