  "body": "I haven't _really_ tested this, but in theory, it prompts you for a 2FA code prior to publishing. If you provide a code, it passes it via the `--opt` flag to `npm publish` which is how the docs specify you should pass it.\r\n\r\nPublishing is quick, and hopefully all of the packages can be published with the same token. But it's possible that it will expire in the middle, which would not be ideal. In that case, you would need to re-run the publish command with modifications to skip the already published packages.\r\n\r\nI'm opening this PR for discussion purposes. I'll give it a little more thought before marking it ready for review.",
