  "body": "This isn't necessarily a bug or a feature, more so asking for why it is implemented as it currently is.\r\nWhen inside of a component, `this.key` is undefined, however `child.key` is defined and has a value within `React.Children.map`. I realize these point to different instances, just demonstrating the difference.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```Javascript\r\n\r\nclass Example extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    console.log(this.key); // undefined\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n       {React.Children.map(this.props.children, child => {\r\n          console.log(child.key); // defined\r\n          return child;\r\n       })}\r\n      </div>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expect `child.key` to not be readable/writeable within `React.Children.map`, however it is both which seems counterintuitive to the idea that `this.key` is undefined within the component.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
