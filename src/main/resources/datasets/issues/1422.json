  "body": "When a rerender requires the last child to be moved to first place, the update to the DOM is not minimal. Instead of removing the child in question and re-inserting it, all the other children are removed and re-added instead.\n\nThis is bad for two reasons:\n1. It is unnecessary churn on the DOM, slowing things down. If any of the children is or contains a video element, the video will reset.\n2. Using keys to shuffle children around is pretty common when implementing an infinite scroll in React with DOM element reuse. This should work.\n\nHere's a screencast showing how the DOM is changed while I scroll. Notice how when I scroll down the first element is correctly removed from the top and inserted at the bottom. When I scroll back up, instead of moving the last element, React moves the other four.\n\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/140702/ReactDomOperations.mov\n\nI'm using React 0.9.0.\n",
