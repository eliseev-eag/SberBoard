  "body": "This fork was already being ignored on master because Scheduler is now a dependency of ReactDOM, and thus isn't being bundled with it. And in those cases our forking mechanism doesn't kick in.\r\n\r\nIt was also wrong because the exports in it don't match how those functions are named in www.\r\n\r\nI'm deleting it. During the sync we'll need to rename our internal `customSchedule` to just `schedule` fork in our www `node_modules` shims, and then tweak it to match the `unstable_` API names. We'll also need to tweak existing `customSchedule` callsites.",
