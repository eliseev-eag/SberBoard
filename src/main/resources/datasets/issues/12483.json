  "body": "Per the conversation on #12453, there are a number of third-party libraries (particularly those that generate higher-order components) that are performing suboptimal validation of element types.\r\n\r\nThis commit exposes a function that can perform the desired check without depending upon React internals.\r\n\r\nIn #12453, we discussed exposing this check within the new `react-is` package, but as I dug in, I lost confidence that that was indeed the right course of action.\r\n\r\nToday, element type validation occurs within `ReactElementValidator`. `ReactElementValidator` has a dependency upon `ReactElement`, but lacks a dependency upon `react-is`. (In fact, the nothing within the core `react` package takes a dependency upon `react-is`.)\r\n\r\nIt felt wrong to duplicate the [existing type validation code](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12483/files#diff-e1ed11a9f728e656700a09c5e5b8421aL291) in a separate package, and it also felt wrong to factor it into `react-is` and introduce a new dependency from `react` to `react-is`. As such, I placed the type validation logic alongside `React.isValidElement` within `ReactElement`.\r\n\r\nI realize that expanding the surface area of React's top-level API is a dicey prospect, but I wanted to explain my reasoning and propose it in code. If you think an alternative implementation would be more ideal, please just let me know and I'll revise.",
