  "body": "So I was trying to implement a simple login page using React and Google's Material design Lite (MDL) framework. I have come across a very strange thing: The MDL's input with floating label doesn't work when rendered using React.\n\nMy code is: \n\n```\nvar Login = React.createClass({\n\n    render: function(){\n\n        return(\n\n            <div className=\"mdl-grid\">\n\n            <div className=\"mdl-cell mdl-cell--2-col\"></div>\n\n            <div className=\"mdl-cell mdl-cell--8-col\">\n\n                <form>\n\n                    <div className=\"mdl-textfield mdl-js-textfield mdl-textfield--floating-label\">\n\n                        <input className=\"mdl-textfield__input\" type=\"text\" id=\"sample3\" />\n\n                        <label className=\"mdl-textfield__label\" htmlFor=\"sample3\">Text...</label>\n\n                    </div>\n\n                </form>\n\n            </div>\n\n            </div>\n\n        );\n    }\n\n});\n```\n\nBut when I try to use the same thing directly in the HTML, it works fine.\nP.S: By \"works fine\", I mean the animation and colored line that appears below the text box onfocus. \nI think this has something to do with the Synthetic event system implemented by React. I fiddled around with their javascript and found they are doing a bit of stuff with the native \"keydown\", \"onfocus\" events, among others.\n\nSimilar thing is happening for other elements like an expanding text field. I haven't checked, but I'm sure React + MDL will break at many components of MDL framework. Is this because of the Synthetic event system?\n\nAny way to work around this to get these both working? Or is it safe to assume that React and MDL are incompatible?\n",
