  "body": "This PR addresses issue #1700 \r\n\r\nCurrently it only re-adds the original note.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'd like to discuss adding a new section, maybe called \"Selecting Multiple Values\", with a full example similar to the current `<select>` flavor example. This example would instead involve selecting multiple values by appending or removing values from the array in the `value` property of the `<select>` tag when the user clicks an `<option>` tag. Would this be preferable to the single block-quote style note from the old docs?",
