  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\n`useEffect` results in the following exception in the console:\r\n```\r\nUncaught TypeError: callback is not a function\r\n    at flushFirstCallback (scheduler.development.js:348)\r\n    at flushWork (scheduler.development.js:441)\r\n    at MessagePort.channel.port1.onmessage (scheduler.development.js:188)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am unable to isolate the problem enough to create a sandbox that reproduces it. I am posting it here in case there is still some value in it (it seems slightly related to https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/5851, https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io/issues/460 and even https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/15194).\r\nThis is my component:\r\n```js\r\nconst RemoteControlledSliderRaw = ({ activeIndex, currentlyDragging, className, children }) => {\r\n\tconst [forcedX, setForcedX] = React.useState(null);\r\n\r\n\tReact.useEffect(() => {\r\n\t\tif (currentlyDragging) {\r\n\t\t\twindow._animateItem.update = setForcedX;\r\n\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\tif (window._animateItem.update) {\r\n\t\t\t\tsetForcedX(null);\r\n\t\t\t\twindow._animateItem.update = null;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}, [currentlyDragging]);\r\n\r\n\treturn (\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<SliderCore activeIndex={activeIndex} forcedX={forcedX} className={className}>\r\n\t\t\t\t{children}\r\n\t\t\t</SliderCore>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat *might* be interesting is that I set a global object to point to a `setState` setter. That can be called from the outside. I am not sure exactly how the exception occurs, but if I comment out the entire `useEffect` bit, it goes away.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nNo exception. Or at least one that provides some explanation as to what is wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.8.6. I don't know if this worked with earlier versions.\r\n",
