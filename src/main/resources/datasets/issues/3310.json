  "body": "`console` is `undefined` in earlier versions of IE when it is not open. This causes an uncaught exception, and breaks applications in these versions of IE when attempting to `warn` while the  console is closed.\nAdmittedly, `console` will usually be open when testing in development, but still, React should not break the application when it is not. I often fire up IE 9 to do quick smoke tests in development and don't bother to open the `console`.\nThis just adds a check in `warning.js` that `console` exists before calling `warn` on it.\n",
