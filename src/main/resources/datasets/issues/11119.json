  "body": "Fixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11103.\r\n\r\nAccording to [the spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/single-page.html#preprocessing-the-input-stream), HTML parser turns `\\r\\n` or lone `\\r` into `\\n`.\r\n\r\nSince we compare JS app string (which might have `\\r`) with the representation parsed from HTML (which can't), we have a false positive text mismatch warning.\r\n\r\nI am solving this by adding a second check. It's only activated when we have a mismatch, so it only penalizes users with mismatching markup, or users with `\\r` in content.\r\n\r\n<s>I opted **not** to patch up the markup when the only difference is `\\r` normalization. This is because we never did that before, and nobody complained. So it's probably unobservable to the user anyway (even though it's observable from the DOMâ€”you can't have `\\r` by setting `innerHTML` or parsing, but you can if you `createTextNode`s with it directly).</s>\r\n\r\n<s>An alternative could be to always normalize `\\r` when creating text nodes (and patch up markup if we encounter it). This would also make the behavior consistent between `innerHTML` and `createTextNode` path on the client side.</s>\r\n\r\n<s>It seems like we can always do the latter if we want to, but the former is an unobtrusive fix that can be applied now.</s>\r\n\r\nUpdated it to just ignore the warning, but still patch up. Production logic doesn't change now.\r\n\r\nLater updated to normalize both server and client values before emitting the warning. I started stripping both null and \"replacement\" character (browser sometimes turns null into it) since that's the only other corner case I know.",
