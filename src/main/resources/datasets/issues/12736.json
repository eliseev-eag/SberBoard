It caused a few headscratchers for me while refactoring old code, so I'm reporting it just in case.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThis appears in 16.3.2. Given that it is specific to forwardRef, it shouldn't apply to older versions.",
