  "body": "Hey guys, I want to bring out some issue in docs, Install section. https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html. This happened to me and one of my colleagues and I guess others may get confused too.\r\n\r\nFor example I want to use create-react-app approach for installing react.\r\nThis means I need to follow ONLY this section right: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html#creating-a-single-page-application\r\n\r\nBut after my colleague followed that, he then thought had do follow things like this too:\r\nhttps://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html#enabling-es6-and-jsx\r\n\r\nIn other words the installation docs, doesn't say that if you follow the first link I gave for example above, following second link is not necessary as create-react-app includes Babel for example.\r\nIsn't it?\r\n\r\nI think the doc has to mention that it is an OR approach, either use this section, or this, etc.",
