  "body": "I've been playing lately with getting React to work for building client/server apps for the new Apple TV so I'm opening this thread just to start the conversation around the issue in case other people are also looking into it.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the subject the SDK for the new Apple TV lets you build JavaScript applications that get loaded from your server and evaluated in a JS context on the device. Now for building interfaces they came up with a [DOM implementation](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/tvos/documentation/TVMLJS/Reference/TVJSFrameworkReference/) and some flavour of XML called [TVML](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/tvos/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/ATV_Template_Guide/) that just bridges to native UI components and APIs (much like React Native in a way). They also have a small JavaScript API called [TVJS](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/tvos/documentation/TVMLJS/Reference/TVJSFrameworkReference/) for creating documents, making HTTP calls, etc.\n\nThis way of building apps is an alternative to the traditional iOS development that you can also do on the Apple TV with Swift/Obj-C, UIKit and the other frameworks. The interesting thing is that the default Apple TV apps like Music, TV Shows, etc. are built as JS client/server apps with Browserify and Handlebars templates.\n\nSo at a first try React kind of works on the platform (you might need to shim `window` and `document` as they are not available) but as you start getting into the details you realise there are some limitations to ATV's DOM model. For example I just noticed that [IDL attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes#Content_versus_IDL_attributes) are not working so that might be a problem. Then some elements are conflicting with HTML elements that have the same name, same issue for property names, and so on.\n\nIn conclusion I think a custom React renderer for the Apple TV would be the solution but the strange thing is that it would still be a DOM renderer like `react-dom` only configured for ATV's elements and attributes and patched for its DOM implementation's quirks. Do you guys think this is feasible?\n",
