In fact, any attribute will be same performance.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n[https://jsfiddle.net/un3v8oh6/67/](https://jsfiddle.net/un3v8oh6/67/)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI know that ReactDOM.hydrate do not patch attribute differences. But when I want to setState in componentDidMount, the real DOM still do not rerender. I guess that ReactDOM.hydrate may update new state in virtual DOM so it thinks the DOM not change when I do setState. I think this is a bug.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nChrome 72\r\nReact 16.8.4\r\n",
