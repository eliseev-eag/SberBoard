  "body": "In most examples and user source I've read it's commonly seen to import the package name as such we commonly see `import React from 'react';` or 'require('react')`. However, because of this minor detail bundling tools like Browserify may interpret`React`differently from`react`and thus options to exclude`react` from builds fail and the source gets bundled anyway which causes the following error: \n\n```\nInvariant Violation: addComponentAsRefTo(...): Only a ReactOwner can have refs. You might be adding a ref to a component that was not created inside a component's `render` method, or you have multiple copies of React loaded.\n```\n\nSo this minor change will fix that issue.\n",
