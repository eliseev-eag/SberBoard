  "body": "Introduces a new priority level, **Task**. (The name is provisional. We'll come up with something better later.)\r\n\r\nTask priority is similar to Synchronous priority. Both are flushed in the current tick. The difference is\r\n\r\n- work with the **Task** priority is performed within the current tick, but at the end of the batch of work (after all work has been committed).\r\n- work with the **Synchronous** priority is performed immediately. E.g. a synchronous `setState` will perform all its work before the `setState` call exits.\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8127, these two types of work priority were both considered \"synchronous.\" Splitting them into separate concepts will make it easier to schedule and batch things correctly.\r\n\r\nCurrently used for `batchedUpdates` and nested sync updates. Task should also be used for updates inside `componentDidUpdate/Mount`, error boundary work, and events. I'll leave these for a future PR.\r\n\r\nThere's an error boundary regression that I haven't looked at yet. I'll investigate it in the morning. Pushing this now because I'm about to go to bed and I don't want to block @gaearon.",
