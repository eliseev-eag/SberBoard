  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nAn error is thrown in IE 11. The error message states \"Cannot create property for a non-extensible object\". It originates from the following location:\r\n\r\nFile \"webpack:///./node_modules/react-dom/lib/PooledClass.js\" line 98\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nNo errors.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThe version number is react-dom@15.6.1. This used to work, and the error messages started when I implemented DLLPlugin on Webpack, which involved outputting all dependencies in a single file. I'm not sure why that would be a problem, though.\r\n",
