  "body": "Seems to be a busy day, but I'd like to drop some notes on what I've seen from the next documentation:\n- Like I said, would be nice to have a mention of css-ing with `style` key, and some integration within existing/new examples.\n- DOM differences should include CSS camelCasing and a link toward the form section (with the new `defaultValue` and all).\n- The part on DOM differences is currently in the reference section and is not obvious enough imo.\n- Self-closing tags are always ok in React (?), even on elements you wouldn't normally self-close: `<span />`, `<div />`. Although this might be in DOM differences, since it applies to every React component, it should probably be mentioned elsewhere. E.g. it's obvious now that `<Hello />` is possible, but it's actually not mentioned (unless I missed it) that `<Hello>hi</Hello>` is also valid, and that what's inside goes into `props.children`.\n",
