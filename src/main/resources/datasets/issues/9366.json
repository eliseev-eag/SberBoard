  "body": "### Remove non-existent /lib/ from souce files\r\n\r\nThese files donâ€™t really exist anymore. We are already using Rollup shims to alias them, and the inconsistent usage of `/lib/` is more confusing than helping there. Additionally this prevents us from syncing React Native to the flat React version. Also removes a bunch of hacks from Rollup config.\r\n\r\n### Replace all shims with explicit access \r\n\r\nThis deletes shims and changes to access `require('react').__DO_NOT_USE__` from renderers for global shared state.\r\n\r\nI cloned `flattenChildren()` and `traverseAllChildren()` because they relied on `CurrentOwner` but were used both from Stack and Isomorphic. The stack implementations will die, and the isomorphic ones can be changed to be optimized for Children specifically in the future.\r\n\r\nI also deleted UMD shims because they are now unnecessary. I moved the internals assignment to main modules since they're now used in tests, and made them direct UMD entry points.\r\n",
