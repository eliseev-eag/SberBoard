  "body": "**what is the change?:**\r\nFor now...\r\nWe need to grab a slightly different implementation of rAF internally at\r\nFB than in Open Source. Making rAF a dependency of the ReactScheduler\r\nmodule allows us to fork the dependency at FB.\r\n\r\nNOTE: After this lands we have an alternative plan to make this module\r\nseparate from React and require it before our Facebook timer polyfills\r\nare applied. But want to land this now to keep master in a working state\r\nand fix bugs folks are seeing at Facebook. This is basically the same as previously closed PR https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12831\r\n\r\nThanks @sebmarkbage @acdlite and @sophiebits for discussing the options\r\nand trade-offs for solving this issue.\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nThis fixes a problem we're running into when experimenting with\r\nReactScheduler internally at Facebook, **and* it's part of our long term\r\nplan to use dependency injection with the scheduler to make it easier to\r\ntest and adjust.\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nRan tests, lint, flow, and will manually test when syncing into\r\nFacebook's codebase.\r\n\r\n**issue:**\r\nSee internal task T29442940",
