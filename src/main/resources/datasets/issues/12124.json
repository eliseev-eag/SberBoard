Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.

Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\ntested with React >= 16\r\nno extra elements with React 15\r\n\r\n\r\nDuplicate keys are mistakes, but these DOM elements should not be there anyway.",
