Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/muddy-https-r6w7p\r\nIt behaves alright when the default input(file selector) is clicked. But when the div that refers to the input(with `htmlFor`) is clicked, it seems like triggering the old props.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact v16.8.6\r\n",
