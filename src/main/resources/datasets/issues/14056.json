(or maybe I'm doing something wrong)\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nComponent with resource.read() wrapped on `\r\n<Suspense />` is causing the whole application to delay initial render (until `maxDuration` exceeds)\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kevinwolfcr/exchange-rate-cr/blob/master/src/app.js\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhat I expect is to delay the render of only the code within the `<Content />` component, not the whole `<App />` component.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nreact: `^16.7.0-alpha.0`\r\nreact-cache: `2.0.0-alpha.0`\r\nreact-dom: `^16.7.0-alpha.0`",
