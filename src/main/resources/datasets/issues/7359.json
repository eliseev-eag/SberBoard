  "body": "In Google Chrome, backspacing an controlled and uncontrolled number inputs causes an unexpected behavior:\n\n![backspace](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/590904/17160637/6dfbca3a-5374-11e6-9a0d-0a2c52813eea.gif)\n\nMore cases (and what fixes look like) here: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7253#issuecomment-236074326\n## Issues with uncontrolled inputs\n\nThis is because assigning `defaultValue` causes side-effects on `value`. It seems to trigger validation on `value` as if it were directly assigned itself. \n\nThis Codepen provides a step by step reproduction case:\n\nhttp://codepen.io/nhunzaker/pen/zBaokp\n\n![wat](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/590904/17160341/4d3acf64-5372-11e6-9871-64c6063b23b0.gif)\n\nThis PR wraps the `defaultValue` assignment in a conditional so that it will only ever be assigned if the defaultValue has changed.\n## Issues with controlled inputs\n\nIt looks like the issue here is that value is being assigned using the standard React method of updating attributes when the props get passed in here:\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/shared/ReactDOMComponent.js#L926\n\nThere is some logic in ReactDOMInput to prevent duplicate values from being assigned here:\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/client/wrappers/ReactDOMInput.js#L201-L210\n\nUnfortunately the new value has already been assigned.\n\nThis PR adds a check for the `value` prop, and only assigns it if is different. It never assigns the value attribute if it hasn't changed:\n\nI don't really know why this works. I didn't think node.setAttribute('value', value) was meaningful. What do you think?\n\n---\n\nRelated to https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7253\n",
