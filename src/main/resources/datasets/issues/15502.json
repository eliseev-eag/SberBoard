  "body": "React has an unfortunate quirk where updates are sometimes synchronous — where React starts rendering immediately within the call stack of `setState` — and sometimes batched, where updates are flushed at the end of the current event. Any update that originates within the call stack of the React event system is batched. This encompasses most updates, since most updates originate from an event handler like `onClick` or `onChange`. It also includes updates triggered by lifecycle methods or effects. But there are also updates that originate outside React's event system, like timer events, network events, and microtasks (promise resolution handlers). These are not batched, which results in both worse performance (multiple render passes instead of single one) and confusing semantics.\r\n\r\nIdeally all updates would be batched by default. Unfortunately, it's easy for components to accidentally rely on this behavior, so changing it could break existing apps in subtle ways.\r\n\r\nOne way to move to a batched-by-default model is to opt into Concurrent Mode (still experimental). But Concurrent Mode introduces additional semantic changes that apps may not be ready to adopt.\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces an additional mode called Batched Mode. Batched Mode enables a batched-by-default model that defers all updates to the next React event. Once it begins rendering, React will not yield to the browser until the entire render is finished.\r\n\r\nBatched Mode is superset of Strict Mode. It fires all the same warnings. It also drops the forked Suspense behavior used by Legacy Mode, in favor of the proper semantics used by Concurrent Mode.\r\n\r\nI have not added any public APIs that expose the new mode yet. I'll do that in subsequent commits.",
