  "body": "Added an automated test that would have caught the regression introduced with #11291 and fixed by #11350.\r\n\r\nThe new test verifies that this:\r\n```js\r\ninvariant(condition, 'This is not a real error message.');\r\n```\r\n\r\nGets transformed to this:\r\n```js\r\n!condition ? invariant(false, 'This is not a real error message.') : void 0;\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrior to #11291 it would not have been transformed (and so would have been slightly less efficient). After #11291 (with the regression) it would have failed with:\r\n```js\r\n+ !condition ? __DEV__ ? invariant(false, 'This is not a real error message.') : 'This is not a real error message.' : void 0;\r\n```",
