  "body": "For finding those issues I've used `eslint-plugin-jsdoc` as it allows more granular enabling of checks (compared with `valid-jsdoc` rule in the eslint itself).\n\nI've not yet added those checks into `.eslintrc`, because there are more JSDocs issues which need to be fixed first. You can see the eslint changes in my other [branch](https://github.com/mhujer/react/commits/eslint).\n\nNote: I understand that this is a massive change that can cause conflicts with other PRs, but I think it is worth it.\n",
