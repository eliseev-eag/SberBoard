  "body": "This may be a question moreso than a feature request, but I can't seem to find the answer around the web. It seems most people are working on small apps or just ignoring this as an issue.\r\n\r\nI am working on a large react application, and seeing some issues with end-to-end testing. We have a webdriverio/selenium setup which seems to be rather common from what I understand. We use these tools to click some buttons, type some text, etc., and then find the affected DOM elements and do some assertions.\r\n\r\nHowever, and here is where the problem is, React does not synchronously perform all operations on the read DOM. It will use various methods to schedule work, which will be done asynchronously at some later time. I have found that in our tests, a few assertions at random will see that the real DOM is still in the previous state (rather than the new state that results from having clicked the button and whatnot) in every large test run.\r\n\r\nI have not seen many posts on the internet even acknowledge this as an issue. The one that I found that does only suggests adding timeouts throughout the tests. However, for obvious reasons, this is slow and non-deterministic.\r\n\r\nIs there a suggested way to know that a React application has finished performing all scheduled work? And if not, is there a discussion about this happening somewhere?\r\n",
