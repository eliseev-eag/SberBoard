  "body": "Prompted by https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6925#issuecomment-275452387. Our examples are really not great examples of how to use React. They are not maintained at all and add little value.\r\n\r\nWe should consider either:\r\n\r\n1. Rewriting all the examples so they are easier to use and represent good practices.\r\n2. Rewrite only a couple and remove all the rest\r\n3. Remove all examples\r\n\r\nI'm partial to just removing all of them, or if anything providing a single example that is well built.\r\n\r\ncc @gaearon @spicyj @bvaughn ",
