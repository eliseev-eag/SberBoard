  "body": "Prior to this, React was using a nextDebugID variable that was locally\nscoped to both `instantiateReactComponent` and `ReactShallowRenderer`.\nThis caused problems when the debugIDs would collide, the `itemMap` in\n`ReactComponentTreeHook` would be overwritten and tests would fail\nwith the message \"Expected onBeforeMountComponent() parent and\nonSetChildren() to be consistent\".\n\nThis change shares the debugID with both modules thus preventing any\ncollisions in the future.\n\nFixes #7927\n\nIdeally this would be in the next (hotfix?) release of React 15.x as this is preventing us (Airbnb) from upgrading at the moment.\n",
