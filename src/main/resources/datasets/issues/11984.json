  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nReport a bug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIn Google Chrome, an element with the onMouseMove and onMouseEnter listeners will not fire the events unless clicked. Likewise, onMouseLeave will not fire unless the mouse is clicked on an area not occupied by the listening element.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.**\r\n\r\nThe following JSFiddle reproduces the bug: https://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/97542/.\r\nTo reproduce, simply create an element with the above listeners and test their behavior in Chrome.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe onMouseEnter, onMouseMove, and onMouseLeave listeners should fire in Chrome without the mouse needing to be clicked.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI tested this with React 16.2 on my own development server, and also React 0.14.3 in the above JSFiddle. In both cases, the problem occurs. I am using Debian 9, kernel version 4.9.0-5-amd64, and Chrome Version 63.0.3239.132 64-bit to reproduce the error. I tried to reproduce this issue on Windows with the same major version of Chrome, but it seems to work properly.\r\n  \r\n  ",
