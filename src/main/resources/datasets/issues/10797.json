  "body": "Removes now-dead `ReactComponentTreeHook` and `ReactHostOperationHook`, `ReactDebugTool`, `ReactInstrumentation`, `ReactPerf`, and the calls to host operation hook in DOM utilities.\r\n\r\nIn Fiber, we never have a `debugID`, so removes the associated codepaths. Also removes `on*` methods on hooks since in Fiber we call `validateProperties()` directly.\r\n\r\nAdds empty shims for methods RN still depends on. They are already no-ops, so now we just make this explicit (and add a TODO to remove the dependency). Isnâ€™t it nice to learn this before sync? Yay flat bundles.\r\n\r\nThe next (and last) step is in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10798.",
