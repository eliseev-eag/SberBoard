  "body": "A design question raised in another bug: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5313#issuecomment-152668532\n\nWhat is the ideal behavior?  Why don't we support `setState()` in the constructor?  It seems better than having people manually add `this.state = {...}` in the constructor, since the current method encourages the imperative pattern that can't be used elsewhere in the component.  cc @sebmarkbage for an answer.\n",
