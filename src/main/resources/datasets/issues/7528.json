  "body": "I have to display a large amount of markup generated on the server inside a Component. \n\nIt's A LOT of markup (around 10.000 `<li><a></a></li>`), and dangerouslySetInnerHTML takes a long time. It stalls the page for several seconds, and sometimes crashes Chrome.\n\nI assume that this happens because react parses the HTML and creates elements for everything.\n\nIs there a way around this behaviour?\n(ps: I also tried creating the `<li>` s as you normally would. that takes way to long as well)\n",
