  "body": "This changes how `eslint-plugin-react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` works.\r\n\r\nTake this component as an example:\r\n```js\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  const myContext = useMyContext();\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    myContext.setValue(e => e + 1);\r\n  }, [myContext.setValue]);\r\n  return null;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe exhaustive deps rule compains with the warning that `myContext` is missing from the deps array. However, because calling the function changes stuff in `myContext` adding it to the deps array would result in an endless re-render loop.\r\n\r\nPlease see #15924 for more information. For an interactive version, please see this CodeSandbox:\r\n[![Edit react-issue-15924](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-issue-15924-yz8uq?fontsize=14)\r\n\r\nAs long as we don't use the result of a function, it's fine to include the function itself to the deps array instead of including the object it comes from.\r\n\r\nIf anything should work differently as how I implemented it, please let me know and I'll try to adjust my code.\r\n\r\nThis solves issues #15924 and #15448.",
