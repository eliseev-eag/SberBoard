  "body": "See this jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/tvxderw3/\n\nIn Chrome, as you quickly move your mouse up and down the list, you'll notice that some get stuck in the hover state. This works fine in Safari, and works in Chrome if you use a stable key between the hover states. I think `mouseout` somehow isn't firing if the underlying DOM node is replaced by a new one in the same tick, but it's odd that this is a Chrome-only bug.\n",
