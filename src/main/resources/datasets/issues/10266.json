  "body": "I don't see the way to obtain the top level element with the new async `ReactDOM.render`\r\n\r\nPreviously `ReactDOM.render` would return the top level component:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst component = ReactDOM.render(<Foo />, container);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow there is the third argument with callback which does not pass the rendered component into callback.\r\n\r\n```\r\nReactDOM.render(<Foo />, container, (component) => {\r\n   assert(component, \"boo!\"); // ALWAYS boo!\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it is a bug that top level component is not returned in callback.",
