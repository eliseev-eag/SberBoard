  "body": "\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nbug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI'm using TSX and Electron and using the <webview> element. \r\n\r\nI'm using <webview disablewebsecurity> and it's complaining that this isn't accepted.\r\n\r\nThis is a supported property.  It's also represented properly in the typescript types for this element.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    interface WebViewHTMLAttributes<T> extends HTMLAttributes<T> {\r\n        allowFullScreen?: boolean;\r\n        allowpopups?: boolean;\r\n        autoFocus?: boolean;\r\n        autosize?: boolean;\r\n        blinkfeatures?: string;\r\n        disableblinkfeatures?: string;\r\n        disableguestresize?: boolean;\r\n        disablewebsecurity?: boolean;\r\n        guestinstance?: string;\r\n        httpreferrer?: string;\r\n        nodeintegration?: boolean;\r\n        partition?: string;\r\n        plugins?: boolean;\r\n        preload?: string;\r\n        src?: string;\r\n        useragent?: string;\r\n        webpreferences?: string;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n/home/burton/projects/polar-bookshelf/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:506 Warning: Received `true` for a non-boolean attribute `disablewebsecurity`.\r\n\r\nIf you want to write it to the DOM, pass a string instead: disablewebsecurity=\"true\" or disablewebsecurity={value.toString()}.\r\n    in webview (created by TabBody)\r\n    in TabBody (created by TabPanes)\r\n    in div (created by TabPane)\r\n    in TabPane (created by TabPanes)\r\n    in div (created by TabContent)\r\n    in TabContent (created by TabPanes)\r\n    in TabPanes (created by TabNav)\r\n    in div (created by TabNav)\r\n    in TabNav (created by FakeTabbedBrowser)\r\n    in div (created by FakeTabbedBrowser)\r\n    in FakeTabbedBrowser (created by App)\r\n    in div (created by App)\r\n    in App\r\n```\r\nI just upgraded all my libs to:\r\n\r\n @types/react@16.8.18 @types/react-dom@16.8.4 react@16.8.6 react-dom@16.8.6 \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe <webview> should get the attributes I specify.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n@types/react@16.8.18 @types/react-dom@16.8.4 react@16.8.6 react-dom@16.8.6 \r\n\r\n\r\n... I'm dead in the water on this one so even a workaround would really be appreciated!\r\n\r\nI think this is a React issue since its happening at runtime.  The compiler handles it just fine.",
