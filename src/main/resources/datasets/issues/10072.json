  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nI want to request a *feature*.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n- Warning code is hardcoded to call `fbjs/lib/warning`. This makes it hard to integrate warnings with tools.\r\n\r\n- As a workaround we could use webpackâ€™s `resolve.alias` to alias `fbjs/lib/warning` into our fork which displays it on-screen.\r\n\r\n   - This use case is similar to https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7360.\r\n\r\n- Another use case is to integrate React warnings with our testing infrastructure. This helps us to better see which warning belongs to which test.\r\n\r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/193136/27680560-587f934a-5ce6-11e7-985b-a1a2042d831a.png)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n- React allows library user to override the default warnings behavior.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n- The workaround works in React 15 and should still work in React 16, as the flat bundles does `var warning = require('fbjs/lib/warning')` which means we can still hook into it for now.\r\n\r\n- This probably breaks when the flat bundles stopped doing `var warning = require('fbjs/lib/warning')`.",
