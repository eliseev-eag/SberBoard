In this demo, I have 3 references of custom hook [useFriendStatus], but the state is not identical unless I  add [] as 2nd params of useEffect(as line 70). wait for 10 seconds, the label(online/offline) was not matched the followed green indicator and picker 's green indicator.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nuse or not use [] as 2nd params will not impact the rendering behavior, but only the performance.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n",
