  "body": "I tried resolving host configs statically but it's hard right now because the host config is all over the place in the renderer code.\r\n\r\nIf we want to resolve the host configs statically, we're going to need to put them into separate modules (so that we can use ES imports for better mangling, and to override resolving on the file level).\r\n\r\nI'm working just on that step here. It doesn't change anything from the reconciler's point of view. In some cases (such as with test renderer) I'll have to create a third file that keeps mutable private state that's accessible both by the renderer public API and the host config.\r\n\r\nI did this for all host configs except `react-noop-renderer`. This is because we use `react-noop-renderer`, among other things, for testing the npm `react-reconciler` package, and the way it's written now with inline reconciler calls reflects how external renderers will continue consuming it. When we add inlining, we'll want to keep that system working.\r\n\r\nThe diff appears as if there were a lot of changes, but really it's just moving things around and tweaking what imports what. I didn't change the logic.",
