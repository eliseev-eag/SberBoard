  "body": "I am currently on React Native **0.42.3**. Since then 0.43, 0.44, 0.45 have been released as stable and 0.46 is around the corner. RN 0.42.3 uses React **15.4.2**. March saw the release of RN 0.43 which started using the React 16.0.0-alpha series and completely skipped version 15.5. This has prevented me from updating React Native as I've been waiting for a official \"stable\" release of React 16.\r\n\r\nWe're now in mid June and the official stable Release of React is **15.5.4**. It appears that version 15.6.0 is now entering RC1 and version 16.0.0 is still in alpha.\r\n\r\nSo, the React world in using React 15.5.4 and the React-Native world is using React 16.0.0-alpha.\r\n\r\n1. Does anyone know why React 15.5 was skipped?\r\n2. Is it safe to use a version of React Native 0.43 and up in production?\r\n3. What's the deal with React 16 anyway? It's not even mentioned in the list of [React releases](https://github.com/facebook/react/releases).",
