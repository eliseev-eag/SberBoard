  "body": "The idea was originally that each fiber has a return value. In practice most of what we're modeling here are void functions and we track side effects instead of return values.\r\n\r\nWe do use this for coroutines to short cut access to terminal yields. However, since this can be nested fragments we end up searching the tree anyway. We also have to manage this in transferOutput so it ends up being as expensive. Maybe we can save some traversal for updates when coroutine branches bail out but meh.\r\n\r\nSwapped the `.child` and `.stateNode` on coroutines so that `.stateNode` is the first phase and `.child` is the completed phase. This is a bit more useful.\r\n\r\nUnmount nodes from the first phase when the parent is unmounted.",
