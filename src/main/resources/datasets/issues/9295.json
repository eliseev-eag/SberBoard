  "body": "**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI have a React Component rendering a `<div>` with `background` and `backgroundSize` styles. When the user (via the interface) changes the background URL, the background size style is no longer applied.\r\n\r\nHere's a fiddle that demonstrates the issue:\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/75118/\r\n\r\nNote how clicking the image container causes the grid to become twice as large (`40px` size being ignored) and also causes the large background to start tiling. (`cover` ignored). If you look at the generated DOM, you can see that the `background` value is no longer a composite of the background+background-size declarations as it is in the first render, but just reflects the background value.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would expect React / ReactDOM to combine these two style rules in a consistent way following the two render calls.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nUnknownâ€”currently happening in React 15.4.1 and in the fiddle. I've tested in both Safari and Chrome, and have verified this isn't a browser issue.",
