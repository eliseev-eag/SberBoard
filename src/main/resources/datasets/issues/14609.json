  "body": "I found it rather annoying to iterate on our lint rules. Www/Nuclide has been too slow, and tests, while nice, make it too cumbersome to experiment with one particular use case, or just explore how the rule \"feels\" in practice.\r\n\r\nThis adds a \"playground\" fixture that lets you edit a file in an editor like VSCode and have any changes to rule source be reflected immediately on recheck. I had to make a hacky \"proxy\" rule for that to work because Node would cache the actual rule normally. The resulting workflow is pretty nice and I want to check this in â€” it'll definitely be useful to me but maybe to someone else too.\r\n\r\nObligatory gif:\r\n\r\n![Demo](https://duaw26jehqd4r.cloudfront.net/items/2Z390a31003O0l0o0e3O/Screen%20Recording%202019-01-16%20at%2010.29%20PM.gif?v=d6856125)",
