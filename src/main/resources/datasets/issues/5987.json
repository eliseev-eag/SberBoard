  "body": "Updated the ReactTransitionGroup to accommodate interruptions. Pulling a component out of a transition group will immediately trigger componentWillLeave even if the enter transition hasn't completed (componentDidEnter not fired). This allows for cancelable animations.\n\nThis update does not change the behavior of CSSTransitionGroup since it uses timeouts to control the adding and removing of elements.\n\nNote: This is my first pull request with FB. I completed the CLA just prior to this pull request.\n",
