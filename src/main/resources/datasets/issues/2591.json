  "body": "Quite often, our apps need to render a list of entities.\nEntities usually contain some data and an identifier property like `id` or `key`.\nSometimes we may have some logic inside a component which uses that identifier, e.g. uses it inside some `click` handler to fire an event with `id` of the clicked entity.\n\nHere is a simplified example:\n\n```\nvar Entity = React.createClass({\n    notifyItem: function() {\n        fire('someEvent', { id: this.props.key });\n    },\n\n    render: function() {\n        return <div onClick={this.notifyItem} />;\n    }\n});\n```\n\nWe also find it natural to use these properties as a `key` prop when rendering a list for a proper component recycling.\n\nHowever, with 0.12 `key` was moved out of `props`, and it doesn't seem to be available inside a component at all, so now we have to specify two different props-like values, which looks redundant:\n\n```\n<Entity\n    key={...}\n    entityId={...} />\n```\n\nWould be great to make `key` available inside a component once again in the future versions.\n",
