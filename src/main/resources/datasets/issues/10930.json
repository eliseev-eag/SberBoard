On the saucelabs recording video, we can see the input has value be presented.\r\n\r\nWe used webdriver sendkeys function to insert value to the input box element. Then click the submit button. We check our backend log, the input box value is empty.\r\n\r\nI try to manual the simulator on saucelabs, use the soft keyboard to type the value and click submit. it works.\r\n\r\nI also try use the Android emulator to run the same test, it works too. It seems the sendkeys function didn't trigger the React properly event. so the React component think the input value didn't be changed.\r\n\r\nI saw the React changelog and noticed the upgrade include some input improvment.\r\n\r\nhttps://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2017/06/13/react-v15.6.0.html\r\n\r\nDoes anyone face the same issue and know hope to fix or some workaround.\r\n\r\nThanks, Charles",
