  "body": "So I think this section could use some fleshing out. I think this was the hardest section to follow. There simply isn't enough instruction for beginners to follow along and even worse, the removal of status logic from `Board` was never completed, resulting in duplicate statuses in the final code. This clarifies some of the major talking points in this section and it fixes the duplicate logic problem in the `Board` class.\r\n\r\nLastly, it adds a state of code snapshot at the end of this refactor section to help students who may have broken their code along the way.\r\n\r\n*Before* submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done...\r\n\r\n1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.\r\n2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.\r\n4. Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test`).\r\n5. Make sure your code lints (`npm run lint`) - we've done our best to make sure these rules match our internal linting guidelines.\r\n6. If you haven't already, complete the [CLA](https://code.facebook.com/cla).\r\n",
