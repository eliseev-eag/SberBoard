  "body": "Fixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10328\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, calls to `require()` in scripts context get cached into some kind of module map, similarly like in `jest-haste-map` (or maybe are hoisted to the top of module behind the scenes?). At least that's what I observe.\r\n \r\nBecause the cache isn't invalidated after performing `fs.writeFileSync`, `existingErrorMap` was always the same (despite inline `require`), resulting in `codes.json` file not being updated properly.\r\n\r\nOne way to fix this is through replacing `require` with `fs.readFileSync` and that's what this PR is about.",
