There is a natural place for a `new Error()` stack frame to be stored there.\n\nWe could use this information to work our way back from errors to show information about which `setState` call was the source of the error.\n\nBecause of batching, it is not always possible to make the correct attribution. It could be one of several possible sources.\n\n(Specifically I'd like to use this in Fiber when the starvation protection kicks in. We can show which state transition was kept getting deferred due to higher priority work.)\n",
