  "body": "I have an callback for onBlur that will call setState, and based on the state, some buttons may be removed from the screen.\n\nThe problem is that one of these buttons has a callback that needs to run, as the onBlur was caused by clicking on that button. If setState is called from the onBlur callback, then the callback for the button (onClick) does not run, maybe because it's not technically visible?. I verified that the button callback works fine if the onBlur callback does not call setState.\n\nI worked around the issue by using a window.setTimout that calls setState after 250ms.\n\n``` javascript\n      window.setTimeout( () => {\n        this.setState({\n          editing: false,\n          editValue: this._displayValue(this.props.item[this.valueField])\n        });\n      }, 400);\n```\n\nIs this the right approach?\nOr is this a bug in flux that all callbacks don't run?\nMy expectation is that the all callbacks would run and the setState calls would be cummulative.\n\nThanks for any advice.\n",
