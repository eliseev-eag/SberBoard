We had all these warnings ignored and figured we'd migrate to the new API as part of Fabric.\r\n\r\nThis actually makes little sense. Importing setNativeProps from 'react-native' won't give us the Fabric version of `setNativeProps`. The only way to do that is by calling it on a `ref`. Even with that, we don't know if setNativeProps will exist in fabric, so migrating to a new API just to stop supporting it doesn't make sense. We added a warning and made the implementation in Fabric a no-op here: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15094\r\n\r\nAll things considered, this change isn't necessary today, adds some bloat, is not used anywhere (it's not even exported by React Native's public API in the current release) and just triggers a ton of warnings for us at Facebook. \r\n\r\nAlso, none of our other APIs that we are migrating from for Fabric currently show warnings. It doesn't make much sense to have this one warn but none of the others.\r\n\r\nLet's remove and revisit if we want some form of this in the future.",
