  "body": "This lets you ignore the warning on a single element and its direct child content. This is useful for simple fields that you're expecting to fail such as time stamps.\r\n\r\nNote that this still won't patch up such content so it'll remain inconsistent until an update is flushed. It's also not suitable for nested complex content that may change. That's why it's only shallow.\r\n\r\nThe feature is nice but the architectural mess that is the hydration warning makes this harder than it should be. See individual commits for details.\r\n\r\nThere's also a lot of logic in the renderer code as opposed to just being built-in in the Fiber code. I can imagine us doing a follow up where we move more of the hydration warning logic into shared code. We could feed \"reads\" from the renderer code that provides canonicalized values that then can be used for comparisons inside the shared code which is then used to build up a nice isomorphic error message that can be used across renderers. That part is related to #10085",
