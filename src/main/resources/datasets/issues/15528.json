  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nbug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nThis seems very similar to https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14002\r\n\r\nPut the following code in a react component:\r\n\r\n    <label>Email</label>\r\n    <input type=\"text\" />\r\n\r\nPut the whole app in a cross-origin iframe (as is already the case in CodePen).\r\n\r\nSafari emits the following error in the dev console on render, and every time when you focus the text field:\r\n\r\n> Blocked a frame with origin \"https://s.codepen.io\" from accessing a frame with origin \"https://codepen.io\". Protocols, domains, and ports must match.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, another label text works fine. Only `<label>Email</label>` triggers the error.\r\n\r\n**Demo:** https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MRRbLz\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nNo error is logged in the console.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n- Safari Version 12.1 (14607.1.40.1.4) on macOS 10.14.4\r\n- react and react-dom 16.8.6\r\n\r\n",
