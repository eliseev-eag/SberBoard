  "body": "The bug fixed by this commit prevented the correct parsing of `var` statements with multiple variables being declared. Instead of trying to parse a whole 'variable declarations' (a `var` statement with all its declarations), this visitor now only parses single 'variable declarators'.\n\nAn example (from the tutorial) that did not work before this patch:\n\n``` javascript\n    var CommentBox = React.createClass({\n      ...\n    }),\n\n    CommentList = React.createClass({\n      ...\n    });\n```\n\nWhat did  work is the following:\n\n``` javascript\n    var CommentBox = React.createClass({\n      ...\n    });\n\n    var CommentList = React.createClass({\n      ...\n    });\n```\n\nOf course, there are different coding styles and guidelines. Most developers probably don't like multiple variables being declared with one `var` statement, but nevertheless, it should be possible. \n",
