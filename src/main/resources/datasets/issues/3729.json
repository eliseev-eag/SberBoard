  "body": "I'm using react with a map library, I use react to render elements in a container which provided by the map library.\n\nThe problem is that the container prevent event bubbling, I checkout reactjs source code found the event emitter listen on html document and depend on event bubbling to dispatch event.\n\nHow can I make the onClick handler to work? I currently addEventListener manually but don't think it an elegant way.\n\n```\n<body>\n  <container preventBubbling>\n    <ReactElement onClick={this.handleClick}/>\n  </container>\n</body>\n```\n\nI'm wondering could react provide an option to bind event listener on html elements instead of entire document.\n",
