  "body": "In looking through the TODO's, I found this one concerning inlining trapping bubbled events, since the function is being called in an equivalent case statement\r\n\r\nThe function was a no-op for input and select so those changes are just removals. I wasn't exactly sure what to do with the comments. For the `isMounted` one, I duplicated it where the function was being called and for the one about null nodes I dropped it since it seemed specific to bubbling events\r\n",
