  "body": "I made tests a bit too verbose in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11616.\r\nMight be a good time to revisit how we write them now.\r\n\r\nThere's a few separate issues:\r\n\r\n* Asserting on warning messages is too verbose. Need a DEV block, call `spyOnDev`, normalize stack, etc. Ideally I wish there was a higher level helper that lets us \"push\" expected warning assertions and validate them as they happen. It should handle component stacks automatically without having to copy-paste the normalization helper everywhere.\r\n\r\n* In some cases I added actual duplication in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11616, in particular for cases that throw in development but don't throw in production. Maybe need a `toThrowInDev()`? Although on the other hand this pattern needs to be highly visible so maybe extracting common code in a closure is good enough.",
