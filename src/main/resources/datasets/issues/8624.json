I've tried logging the next and previous state inside `shouldComponentUpdate` and they show up as identical even though they shouldn't be.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nComponent should update\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nLatest version\r\n",
