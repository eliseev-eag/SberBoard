It cannot be overridden with custom `defaultValue` prop.\r\n\r\n![react-bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15055317/43267391-d6400bb6-90bb-11e8-964e-35510949cbf1.gif)\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem as though changing `defaultValue` affect it at all. Nothing seems to change this behavior besides wrapping the secondarily rendered input in an aditional div tag.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem:**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/j2oyow6jky\r\n\r\nSee fix here: https://codesandbox.io/s/l2rxp94n17\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThat the newly rendered input in completely independent and is not rendered with the value of the first input.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact version: 16.3.2\r\nHave not tested in previous versions.",
