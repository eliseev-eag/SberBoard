Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nI am unsure how I could adequately reproduce this environment in a sandbox. \r\n\r\nThe code is being transpiled with webpack/babel, but is exactly as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\r\n\r\nconsole.log(\"webpacked script is working!\");\r\n\r\nconst Hello = () => <div>hello</div>\r\n\r\nconst graph = document.querySelector('a[href*=\"url_here\"]');\r\n\r\nconsole.log(graph);\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(<Hello />, graph);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error message screenshot: \r\n\r\n![screen shot 2019-01-07 at 3 01 21 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22137047/50793151-4b0bc380-1295-11e9-9a3d-d100496562e9.png)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe `<Hello />` component should render into the DOM.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThis is React 16.6.3. Have not attempted in previous versions.\r\n",
