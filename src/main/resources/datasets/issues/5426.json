Unfortunately, from the legal standpoint, simply specifying the name of the license is not enough, because it's unclear where to get the EXACT (legally binding) text of that license. This is a major roadblock on our way to using the module, seriously.\n\nThanks a lot for the great code, and thanks in advance for fixing this blocker.\n",
