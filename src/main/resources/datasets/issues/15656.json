  "body": "I have a react component which is basically a form that submits a company's data. Everything is okay till I fill the form but when I submit the form and it goes to the next page it shows the following error:\r\n\r\n````\r\nWarning: setState(...): Cannot update during an existing state transition (such as within `render` or another component's constructor). Render methods should be a pure function of props and state; constructor side-effects are an anti-pattern but can be moved to `componentWillMount`.\r\n````\r\nI tried looking for answers in other questions and GitHub but to no avail. My entire code for that component is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/BikalNepal/b0185dee1528e396ff3a91a4f0caf9bd\r\n\r\nI'm aware that this can happen because of setState being an async function so I tried putting await in front of setStates but that doesn't work either, instead throws some other errors. Any help would be appreciated. Thank You!\r\n\r\nI'm using React 15.6.1\r\nOS: Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS\r\nand Chrome v. 70\r\n",
