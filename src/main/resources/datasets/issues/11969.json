  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nA feature\r\n\r\nI imagine this might've been brought up before, but I couldn't find any discussions on this after extensive searching...\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWorking with certain (non-react) 3rd party libraries sometimes require you to remount a dom-node, i.e dumping it and creating it from scratch. Currently, the only way seems to be to change its `key` prop, either by incrementing it or by generating some random uid. However, that feels like a \"hacky\" way of implementing that behavior.\r\n\r\nI've had this issue before when working with the YouTube Player API and now with an SVG-drawer library. I wish there was a cleaner \"react-way\" of doing this.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if we could do something like:\r\n\r\n    this.forceRemount();\r\n\r\nor perhaps better from the parent via refs?\r\n\r\n    this.someRef.forceRemount();\r\n\r\nwhich would have the same effect as changing said components `key` prop.\r\n  ",
