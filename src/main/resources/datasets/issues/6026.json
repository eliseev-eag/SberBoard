  "body": "While `href` is optional for all `<a>`s, it has very specific meaning when it's set but without a value (ie `<a href>`), vs `<a>`, where the former is a link back to the current uri, and the latter is a placeholder link. This can be especially irksome in a React app, because an unexpectedly set `href` can easily change what was meant to be an `onClick` into a full page reload.\n\nHere's a fiddle demoing the bug here: https://jsfiddle.net/jkoudys/hpceoL01/\nYou can see what should be `<a>Bar</a>` rendered as `<a href>Bar</a>` instead.\n\n```\nclass ATest extends React.Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    this.state = {changed: false};\n  }\n  componentDidMount() {\n    setTimeout(this.setState({changed: true}), 400);\n  }\n  render() {\n    let options;\n    if (this.state.changed) {\n      options = [<a key=\"opt1\">Bar</a>];\n    } else {\n      options = [<a key=\"opt1\" href=\"/foo\">Foo</a>];\n    }\n    return <div>{options}</div>;\n  }\n}\n```\n",
