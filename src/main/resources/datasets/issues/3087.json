  "body": "I have an Audio element and I want to know when it's finished playing. the event is `ended`,\nand this event works natively. React doesn't appear to be mapping the ended event.\n\n``` jsx\n<audio onEnded={ this.unsetPlayingItem } src={ url } autoPlay=\"true\" controls />\n```\n\nI'm very new to React so maybe there's something I'm missing, but it seems like this is a bug.\nIf React doesn't wrap all native DOM events then is there a way to easily bind the listener another way?\n",
