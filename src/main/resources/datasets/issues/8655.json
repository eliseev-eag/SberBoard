  "body": "Because `memoizedProps` and `memoizedState` are read from the instance, the\r\ninstance's input pointers (`props`, `state`, `context`) should be updated even\r\nwhen `shouldComponentUpdate` causes a bail-out.\r\n\r\n## Update\r\n\r\nThe scope of this PR changed a bit. The main change is to move memoization to the begin phase, right after reconciliation.\r\n\r\nCurrently we update the memoized inputs (props, state) during the complete phase, as we go back up the tree. That means we can't reuse work until of its children have completed.\r\n\r\nBy moving memoization to the begin phase, we can do a shallow bailout, reusing a unit of work even if there's still work to do in its children.\r\n\r\nMemoization now happens whenever a fiber's `child` property is updated; typically, right after reconciling. It's also updated when `shouldComponentUpdate` returns false, because that indicates that the given state and props are equal to the memoized state and props.",
