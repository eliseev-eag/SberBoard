  "body": "This pull request adds prevProps, prevState and prevContext to the render method.  Here's an example:\n\n``` js\nReact.createClass({\n  render: function(prevProps, prevState, prevContext) {\n    return ...\n  }\n});\n```\n\nI think this will reduce the need to use either componentWillReceiveProps or componentDidUpdate in many cases and result in less code.  Here's an example I pulled partly from the docs for componentWillReceiveProps:\n\n``` js\n// CURRENT APPROACH\nReact.createClass({\n  componentWillReceiveProps: function(nextProps) {  \n    this.setState({\n      likesIncreasing: nextProps.likeCount > this.props.likeCount\n    });\n  },\n  render: function() {\n    return <div>{this.props.likesIncreasing ? 'Cool!' : 'Meh'}</div>\n  }\n});\n```\n\nHere's what the change looks like:\n\n``` js\n// REVISED APPROACH\nReact.createClass({\n  render: function(prevProps) {\n    return <div>{this.props.likeCount > prevProps.likeCount ? 'Cool!' : 'Meh'}</div>\n  }\n});\n```\n\nNot in this pull request but a rad continuation of this idea would be stateless components getting previous props.  I wasn't able to easily identify where stateless components are created so any help pointing me to the right place would be cool.  Something like:\n\n``` js\nmodule.exports = function(props, prevProps) {\n  return <div>{props.likeCount > prevProps.likeCount ? 'Cool!' : 'Meh'}</div>\n};\n```\n\nPrevious state and context has also been added to render in order to match componentDidUpdate's signature but I think prevProps should be there at minimum.\n\nAny feedback/thoughts would be appreciated!\n",
