  "body": "Currently, We use `===` to check if a context is changed [before bailing out](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/shared/stack/reconciler/ReactReconciler.js#L130), but we [create a new context](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/shared/stack/reconciler/ReactCompositeComponent.js#L673) everytime a compnent is updated, regardless the origin context provided by the consumer is unchanged. \n\nAs a result, `===` would always return `false` unless the context is `undefined`. That is, when there is a context, a component would never be bailed out. Specifically, If we use `react-redux`, `react-router`, `react-intl` or any other lib which provides a context, we would get no bailout optimization.\n\nTo fix this, I suggest we use `shallowEqual` instead of `===`. But I am not sure it would introduce a breaking change or not. I have made this change in this PR along with a test.\n",
