  "body": "I have a component with the following proptypes:\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\nComponent.propTypes = {\r\n    media: PropTypes.shape(PropTypes.any),\r\n};\r\n\r\nComponent.defaultProps = {\r\n    media: {},\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nInitially, i set `media` prop as required, but then changed to non-required. Still, the console show a warning:\r\n\r\n`Warning: Failed prop type: The prop \"media.isRequired\" is marked as required in \"Component\", but its value is \"undefined\".`\r\n\r\nWhat I see, is in the prop name that is identifying the \"required\" option, is adding *.isRequired*. Do you think this is a bug? I have faced this several times in my app, but I never got it working properly. The work arround was to change those propTypes to `PropType.any`.\r\n\r\nAny help or idea will be great.",
