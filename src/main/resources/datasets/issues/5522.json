  "body": "I don't like the fact React doesn't allow to use `class` and `style`-as-inline-string attributes. Is there a fork or how hard is to modify React to support it?\nThe reason is that I don't like to manually rename `class` to `className` and without inline styles as string I can't use WebStorm's `extract to class` feature that is really nice while developing new styles.\n",
