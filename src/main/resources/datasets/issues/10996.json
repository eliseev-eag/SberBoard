The environment is like a local code editor, which means that the user already gets familiar with the feel of a code editor. The user doesn't have to install any tooling, so you can start immediately. Also, whenever they want to continue offline they can easily click on 'Download'/'Export' to get a CRA version of the same application so they can work further on it.\r\n\r\nI think we all agree that this would be beneficial, the question is how to approach this without confusing the user. Would be great to have a discussion on this here.",
