  "body": "Hey All,\n\nI'll try my best to explain the scenario, as making a fiddle of the smallest possible case might be hard. Essentially, I have a SPA using React-Router. I'm currently getting a strange behavior in specifically one version of Firefox (31.4esr). \n\nI have two sidebar icons which trigger a change in routes, navigating to a new page. On occasion when I switch quickly between them, I'm getting an error that this.state.list is undefined(this is a list that I populate a dropdown with).\n\nThe issue is, upon debugging, console.log(this.state) is returning an empty object just before the call (that errors) to this.state.list happens in my render method. However, I have list defined in getInitialState (along with a bunch of other state variables) and so this.state definitely shouldn't be empty.\n\nThe only thing I could think of that would be causing this is if due to the quick switching there is some confusion with mounting/unmounting of components and my component still thinks it is mounted, so skips the getInitialState and goes ahead and tries to render. Either that or some bug in React-Router.\n\nAny thoughts? Thanks in advance for the help!\n\nNick\n\nP.S I should reiterate this also only occurs very rarely during quick switching, and normally the componentDidMount -> getInitialState -> render occurs as expected, so it is not simply an error in how my getInitialState is written etc.\n\nEdit: Using React 0.13.3 and React router 0.13.3\n",
