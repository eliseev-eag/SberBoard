  "body": "Callback refs seemed like a strategy to migrate from string refs in React 15 to 16.2. However, I don't see benefits over ref objects except that `current` property can be omitted in rare cases when it's worth it.\r\n\r\nWhat is current status of callback refs? Are they expected to be deprecated in React 17? \r\n\r\nThe documentation tends to recommend ref objects in general but is vague about the future of callback refs. Can we update it with a clarification?",
