  "body": "`unbatchedUpdates` reverses the effect of `batchedUpdates` by resetting the batching context.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect nested updates, which are always deferred regardless of whether they are inside a batch.\r\n\r\nThis change is a partial reversion of https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8634, which added the ability to trigger nested updates using `syncUpdates`. I had thought that was the behavior we wanted for top-level mount and unmount, but it turns out all we really need is the ability to opt-out of `batchedUpdates`. So even though it's a deviation from how Stack works, Fiber does not allow nested updates at all. We may later decide to provide this as an escape hatch, if it helps people migrate to Fiber.",
