That would take two arguments, the first one being the children (array, object, function, etc) and the second one being a component or the component's name. And would return an array of the components that match that. It also could have the second parameter optional, making it organize the return by an object that would return all children separated by type.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\nThis example is not complete and should not be compared to the final proposal function\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\nfunction byType (children, type : string) {\r\n    return React.Children.map(children, child => type == child.type.name? child:null);\r\n}\r\n```",
