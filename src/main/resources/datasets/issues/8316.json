  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nI don't know if it's technically a bug, but to me it's certainly a regression because it inflates the size of the react-dom-server package when used on the client.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nMight be best to just quote the release announcement for React 15.4:\r\n\r\n> Another thing to watch out for is that React DOM Server is now about the same size as React DOM since it contains its own copy of the React reconciler. We don't recommend using React DOM Server on the client in most cases.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nJust like React 15.3 and below, only one copy of the reconciler should be needed when using both React DOM and React DOM Server.\r\n\r\n**What use case do you have for using React DOM Server on the client?**\r\n\r\nFor example, [Selectivity.js](https://arendjr.github.io/selectivity/) allows developers to specify custom templates to customize the rendering of the UI component. But because Selectivity is at its core a non-React library it accepts templates as either strings or functions returning strings that are manually inserted into the DOM. Now, Selectivity does have a React API which also includes a plugin that wraps the templates so they can be specified as functions returning React elements (see the source code for details: https://github.com/arendjr/selectivity/blob/master/src/plugins/react/templates.js). This plugin relies on react-dom-server to transform the React elements to a string understood by Selectivity core.\r\n\r\nWhile the above example is rather specific to a single library, I do think the use case of specifying templates in non-React libraries through JSX might be more widely applicable.",
