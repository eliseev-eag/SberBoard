  "body": "In Web Components `<content>` is used as an intertion point.\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-components-intro-20130606/#insertion-points\nIf there's something in React does the work, it could be like this:\n\n``` coffee\nA = React.createClass\n  render: -> $.div {}, 'A'\n\nB = React.createClass\n  render: -> $.div {}, 'B'\n\nA({}, B({})) # not supposed to work\n```\n\nor even:\n\n``` html\n<A>\n  <div>whatever</div>\n</A>\n```\n\nI only find https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/848 about inserting components by sending them as props. That looks quite ugly when I have several nodes to insert:\n\n``` html\n<A>\n  <div>whatever</div>\n  <div>whatever 2</div>\n  <div>whatever 3</div>\n</A>\n```\n\nAre there any better solutions?\n",
