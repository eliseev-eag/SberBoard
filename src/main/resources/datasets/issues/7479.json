  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nA feature, more specifically, an improvement in the docs.\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\nI have read trough all of React documentation in the last days and was confused by [this](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#no-autobinding) section:\n\n``` js\nconstructor(props) {\n  super(props);\n  this.state = {count: props.initialCount};\n  this.tick = this.tick.bind(this);\n}\n```\n\nThe docs say it is _better performant_ and I couldn't find a place in the docs where it shows the arrow function alternative. I just accidentally learn it from some open source GitHub projects and from a [react-codemod](https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod/blob/master/transforms/manual-bind-to-arrow.js):\n\n``` js\nconstructor(props) {\n  super(props);\n  this.state = {count: props.initialCount};\n}\ntick = () => { /* tick implementation */ }\n```\n\nDoes this approach have the _same_ performance? Shouldn't it be somewhere in the docs?\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\nIt is not a bug.\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nThere should be any kind of mention to **the arrow function approach** to bind methods to the component or preferably, should be well documented.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\nI am sure it is due to an update on React itself, but I am not sure in what version.\n\n---\n\nPD: BTW, if this issue is accepted and planned, I would be happy to make a PR to fix it, with some guidance from the community about what else to include in the docs. :wink:\n",
