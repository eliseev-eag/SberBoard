  "body": "This measurement is already broken (mark/measure calls for it mismatch in Concurrent Mode). This makes debugging very annoying because \"break on caught exceptions\" stops there all the time.\r\n\r\nIt's difficult to keep it up to date because it models a pause rather than an actual work slice. This is why we keep breaking it. I propose that we just remove this timing, and fix it forward with Root Events.",
