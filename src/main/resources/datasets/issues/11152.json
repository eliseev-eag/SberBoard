  "body": "Hi, I'm having an issue with `onMouseEnter` being triggered on children of a component. *It only occurs with React 16*.\r\n\r\nI've created a [CodePen that shows the issue](https://codepen.io/testprofile75/pen/VMXXdb).\r\n\r\nSimplified structure is as below:\r\n```\r\n           <Card/> :\r\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\r\n|                            |\r\n|          <Cover/>          |\r\n|                            |\r\n------------------------------\r\n|                            |\r\n|    <div class=\"text\" />    |\r\n|                            |\r\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\r\n```\r\n\r\n`<Card />` is a component that needs to capture `onMouseMove` events (and trigger a `render`) and `<Cover/>` is a simple component that waits for an image (passed as a `prop`) to be loaded before displaying it (using `onload` on an `Image` created in the `constructor`).\r\n\r\nIf you open the console, you'll see that `onMouseEnter` is triggered when hovering `<Card />` (normal behavior), but also when hovering the `.text` div (which is not supposed to happen).\r\n\r\nIf you remove the whole `onload` logic from the `<Cover/>` element, then `onMouseEnter` works as intended.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that I'm coding this in a way that isn't appropriate, but it does look like a bug anyway :)\r\n\r\n",
