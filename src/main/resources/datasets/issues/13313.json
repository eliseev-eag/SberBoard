  "body": "While testing the new DevTools profiler, I noticed that sometimes– in larger, more complicated applications– an incorrect value was being reported for `actualDuration` (often too large, occasionally negative).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I was unable to capture the problem in a test, but I believe it has something to do with the way I was tracking render times across different priorities and roots. So this PR replaces the old approach with a simpler one that I believe is more robust.\r\n\r\nAnecdotally, the timing problems I was able to reproduce before in my test app(s) are no longer happening after this change. I think the code is also easier to read and reason about now.\r\n\r\nResolves #13309",
