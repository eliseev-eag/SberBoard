  "body": "This PR combines the information from the \"downloads\" tab and the \"getting started\" page into one document.\n\nThe home page used to have two calls to action - \"downloads\" and \"getting started\". I don't think we need both of those, because they are kinda similar; I think we should make one of them \"take the tutorial\" instead. For now that points to the old tutorial but we can update it once the new one is in.\n\nThere are probably useful details I'm still missing here, so I'd appreciate feedback. I wish there was better advice for people who don't want a single-page app, but also don't already have a build pipeline set up.\n\nAlso I updated the fiddle to use ES6 classes so feel free to look at that too\n",
