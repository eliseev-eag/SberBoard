  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug? -ish\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIf you add a deps list state variable but don't use it directly, you get a warning.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\ndeps list allows you to provide sensitivity to a change, it should not be required to use the value that changed.\r\nPossibly this warning should have the message changed to a \"if you know what you're doing\" type message, such as \"you may have left this in by mistake\"\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n^16.8.6\r\n\r\n**example scenario, **\r\nmeasuring the overflow of an element on window resize, `useCallback` used to get the reference to the element to get it's `overflow/inner/scroll` sizes, but this should only be done when the window resize event happens. This can be done using a `customHook` that calls `setWindowSize` when the window is resized, our original `useCallback` can be sensitive to this `windowSize` even though it doesn't need the value directly, it needs to know when that value changed.\r\n\r\nI can add some arbitrary use of that dep to get the warning to go away, but that feels wrong. \r\n\r\nI realize in this example, the `useWindowSize` hook could live inside the `useCallback` hook but that would mean it's value couldn't be used by other hooks/components.\r\n\r\nIt works fine if the warning is ignored, But I have people on my team that see warnings as rules and since react hooks are new, it's hard to argue that it's okay in this case.\r\nmaybe this whole issue is due to some underlying misunderstanding on my part, but think I'm using them correctly.",
