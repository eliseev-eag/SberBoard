  "body": "After upgrading from 15.3.2 to React/ReactDOM 15.4.0 , I noticed that the `onClick` synthetic event (and possibly others) is receiving arguments differently.\r\n\r\nIn 15.3.2, the `onClick` event (without any custom arguments being passed) receives 3 arguments\r\n\r\n0 - `Proxy`\r\n1 - `undefined`\r\n2 - `Event`\r\n(observed in the console of this jsfiddle:  https://jsfiddle.net/u7b6zhfm/1/)\r\n\r\nIn 15.4.0, the `onClick` arguments look like:\r\n0 - `Proxy`\r\n1 - `Event`\r\n(Again viewable in the console here: https://jsfiddle.net/ujuzLhse/)\r\n\r\nThis ended up causing problems in my application because in 15.3.2, I was passing an additional argument to a click handler, and expecting it to be received as the second argument.  Once I upgraded to 15.4.0, the argument was being received as the third (after `Proxy` and `Event`).\r\n\r\nI'm not so sure this is to be considered an \"issue\" with React, but I didn't see anything in the release notes in the way of event handling, so thought I would raise it just in case.\r\n\r\nThe way I ended up adjusting for this is by using the spread/rest operator when passing/receiving arguments in the event handler function, which may be the approach I should have taken to begin with\r\n\r\nPS:  Thank you for all the hard work you guys put into this, super excited for fiber!
