  "body": "Following up on the changes I made in #13367, @gaearon suggest that \"safe\" could be read as necessary for security. To avoid misleading future readers, I'm changing the name.\r\n\r\nA few names where discussed in the previous PR. I think `ToStringValue` makes sense since the value itself is not a string yet but an opaque type that can be cast to a string. For the actual string concatenation, I've used `toString` now to avoid confusion. `toStringValueToString` is super weird and the function is namespaced anyway.\r\n\r\nDefinitely open for other suggestions here as well. My plan is to wait until we wrap up #13362 and then rebase afterwards.",
