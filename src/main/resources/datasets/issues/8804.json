  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen doubleclicking a component, if the initial click create a new component in overlay of the first one,\r\nthen a double click event is emitted on the new component.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/67536/ .\r\n\r\nWhen double clicking on the button, an alert box is created. this should not happen, as the doubleClick handler is on the new component.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe doubleclick event should proably be emitted on the button, not on the new layer.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nTested on Chromium 53/Firefox 50.1 on linux, Chrome 51/Edge/IE11 on Window 10\r\nThis is with 15.4.2. I haven't test it on another version.\r\n",
