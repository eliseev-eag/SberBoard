Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n1. Have a parent component that passes a prop to a child\r\n2. Have a child assign the prop to the state default\r\n3. Unpack the state value and use a`.push` to alter it\r\n4. Watch in horror as both the prop and the state changes.\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/61x9k76v8w\r\nCheck child.js\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nProps should not be reassignable within mounted components\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nAll browsers all OS's React: 16.7.0\r\n",
