  "body": "The `legacy` option was added to the Rollup build system (for www builds) in #11469 because the internal transforms break on getters. As of version 0.60.0 of Rollup, `legacy` support is removed ([source](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/2141), [changelog](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0600)). This PR adds a custom Rollup plugin to replicate the `legacy` behaviour.\r\n\r\nNote that the `legacy` option performed several transformations to support IE8. The custom Rollup plugin only replicates the replacement of getters ([original code here](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/349677ceee9d4bbccb5b2f72e653270cb2b0ce51/src/ast/variables/NamespaceVariable.ts#L63)).\r\n\r\nAlso note that getters are only generated in a very specific case by Rollup. That is, when doing namespace imports (`import * as name from 'origin'`) and one of the imported variables is reassigned at some point (an example of this can be found in the [old Rollup tests](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/tree/349677ceee9d4bbccb5b2f72e653270cb2b0ce51/test/form/samples/legacy-getter)). At this time, the only getter generated by React code is `ReactDOMEventListener._enabled`.",
