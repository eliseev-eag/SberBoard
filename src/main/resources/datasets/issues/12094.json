  "body": "Resolves #12089\r\n\r\nA new feature flag has been added, `debugRenderPhaseSideEffectsForStrictMode`. When enabled, `StrictMode` subtrees will also double-invoke lifecycles in the same way as `debugRenderPhaseSideEffects`.\r\n\r\nBy default, this flag is enabled for `__DEV__` only. Internally we can toggle it with a GK.\r\n\r\nThis breaks several of our incremental tests which make use of the noop-renderer. Updating the tests to account for the double-rendering in development mode makes them significantly more complicated. The most straight forward fix for this will be to convert them to be run as internal tests only. I believe this is reasonable since we are the only people making use of the noop renderer.",
