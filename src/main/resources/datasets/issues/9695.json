  "body": "As the title suggests, this isn't ready for review yet, but I think the big pieces are in place.\r\n\r\nThis refactors the whole begin phase, particularly our model for progressed work. I tried to avoid doing a big refactor like this in the first pass, but eventually gave up â€” there are just too many inter-related things that had to change.\r\n\r\nThis also incorporates a change to make pendingWorkPriority exclude the priority of the fiber it belongs to, as in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8716. Again, I tried to keep this separate but it was too tied to everything else.\r\n\r\nI wrote detailed comments inline as I refactored. I'll do an additional pass once it's closer to review.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in taking a look, read through ReactFiberBeginWork.js. I think it's easier to follow conceptually. The basic algorithm is now:\r\n\r\n- Do we have progressed work since the last commit?\r\n  - If not, reset to current.\r\n  - If we do, did it render at the current priority?\r\n    - If not, stash the progressed work and reset to current. This \"forks\" the child set.\r\n    - If it did, reuse the progressed work.\r\n- Do we have pending props, state, or context?\r\n  - If so, reconcile. This will update the progressed work.\r\n  - If not, bailout. This will leave the progressed work alone.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] `pendingWorkPriority` should represent subtree, excluding fiber it belongs to\r\n- [x] Rebase on top of https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9580 once that lands.\r\n- [x] Finish implementing types of work\r\n  - [x] HostRoot\r\n  - [x] HostComponent\r\n    - [x] `hidden`\r\n  - [x] HostText\r\n  - [x] IndeterminateComponent\r\n  - [x] FunctionalComponent\r\n  - [x] Fragments\r\n  - [x] Classes\r\n  - [x] Portals\r\n  - [x] Coroutines\r\n- [x] Decide on heuristic for determining whether a work-in-progress fiber has been worked on since the previous commit, or if it's actually the \"previous current.\" This can be tricky after a bailout because fibers that bail out aren't marked as progressed work.\r\n- [x] Hydration\r\n- [ ] Bikeshed on naming before landing:\r\n  - [ ] Distinguish between the last work that was reconciled (currently called \"progressed\" work) and the most recent fiber that was worked on, including bailouts (currently called \"newest\" work).\r\n  - [ ] \"Resume\" a work-in-progress versus \"resetting\" by cloning from current.\r\n  - [ ] We use \"bailout\" to mean \"don't reconcile,\" but can we be more specific? Sometimes you bailout and continue working on the child, and other times we do a \"full\" bailout, reuse the current child, and return null.\r\n- [ ] Write additional unit tests (or possible rewrite some existing ones) using an explicit `yield` API to avoid brittleness. (Will probably do this in a later PR; tests aren't changing significantly and I don't think it's blocking.)\r\n- [ ] Follow up with DevTools after this is merged https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/pull/755",
