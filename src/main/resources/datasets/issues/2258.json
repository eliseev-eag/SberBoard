  "body": "`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is a poor fit when trying to provide initial children for other libraries to consume, while safe as long as you don't update the value, it's not very sanitary and in some ways relies implementation details. `dangerouslySetDefaultInnerHTML` works just like `value` vs `defaultValue`, as you would expect.\n\nShould probably be named `dangerousDefaultInnerHTML`, but I kept the current naming convention until #2257 is resolved.\n",
