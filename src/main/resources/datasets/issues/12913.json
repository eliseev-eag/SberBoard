  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nJust questions\r\n\r\n### Some questions regarding props.children\r\n\r\nIn the official React documentation of [React.Children](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactchildren) you can read that ```this.props.children``` is an \"opaque data structure\".\r\nWhat does that mean EXACTLY?\r\n\r\nI think there are in general three possibilities for the transparency of the data structure of ```props.children```:\r\n\r\n#### Case 1: EVERY aspect of the ```props.children```data structure is open and well defined.\r\n\r\n  If this was right then the term \"opaque data structure\" would be completely wrong.\r\n  Therefore \"Case 1\" obviously is not the case.\r\n  \r\n#### Case 2: NO aspect of the ```props.children``` data structure is open or clear.\r\n\r\n   That would mean that whenever you use ```props.children``` you ALWAYS HAVE to use it in combination with ```React.Children``` as ```React.Children``` is the only one (mmmh, is it really the only one?) who knows about the actual data structure of ```props.children```.\r\n   \r\nBut that would imply that it should neither be allowed to use\r\n   \r\n ```javascript\r\n // This is used almost everywhere (even in the official React documentation)\r\n <div>{this.props.children}</div>\r\n ```\r\n\r\n nor\r\n\r\n ```javascript\r\n  // This is often seen with the \"Function as child\" pattern\r\n  MyComponent.propTypes = {\r\n    children: PropTypes.func.isRequired,\r\n  };\r\n  ```\r\n   \r\n As both examples are very common, it seems that \"Case 2\" is obviously also not the case.\r\n\t\r\n#### Case 3: SOME aspects of the ```props.children``` data structure are open and well defined.\r\n\r\nThat would open the possibility that one or even both of the examples in \"Case 2\" are valid.\r\nBut then it would mean that there should be an exact specification what aspects of ```props.children``` is well and openly defined and which aspects are really opaque.\r\nMaybe I've missed something in the React documentation, but I think it's not really exactly specified there, is it?\r\n\r\n#### And last but not least a further question:\r\n\r\nWhy exactly isn't ```props.children``` in case there are some children (one ore more) just always an array (as it is done in \"Preact\" for example)? That would make things so much easier, wouldn't it?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance for the clarifications.\r\n",
