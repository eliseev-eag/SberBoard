  "body": "I am trying to upgrade from `0.14.8` to `15.0.1` in a Universal JS application, without any warnings on `0.14.8`.  I'm getting a few warnings, however I think this might be an issue with ReactDOM?\n### Reuse markup warning\n\n```\nWarning: React attempted to reuse markup in a container but the checksum was invalid. This generally means that you are using server rendering and the markup generated on the server was not what the client was expecting. React injected new markup to compensate which works but you have lost many of the benefits of server rendering. Instead, figure out why the markup being generated is different on the client or server:\n```\n\nWhen I looked into this specific issue it was because on the server an input field with a `required` attribute rendered as `required=\"\"` whereas on the client it's just `required`.\n\nFor a quick example of this issue:\n\n```\n// in node command line\n> ReactDOM.renderToString(React.createElement('input', { required: true }));\n'<input required=\"\" data-reactroot=\"\" data-reactid=\"1\" data-react-checksum=\"573510284\"/>'\n\n// same simple input field rendered in the client via ReactDOM.render\nvar el = React.createElement('input', { required: true });\nReactDOM.render(el, document.getElementById('app'));\n<input data-reactroot required>\n```\n",
