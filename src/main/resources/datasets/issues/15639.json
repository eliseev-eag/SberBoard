  "body": "\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nI think its a bug not sure\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nI am using a function which creates a component which lazy loads the underlying component using React.lazy. My idea for creating this method was to prevent code duplication.  I have a child component which has some text, and its wrapped by a layout. I am trying to dynamically load the child component using suspense and react lazy\r\n```javascript\r\nimport React, { lazy, Suspense } from \"react\";\r\nimport Layout from \"./components/layout\";\r\n\r\nfunction generateLazy(importCompnent) {\r\n  const Content = lazy(importCompnent());\r\n  return props => (\r\n    <Layout>\r\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\r\n        <Content {...props} />\r\n      </Suspense>\r\n    </Layout>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n// Usage in App.js\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\r\nimport createLazy from \"./createLazy\";\r\nimport \"./styles.css\";\r\nconst LazyComponent = createLazy(() => import(\"./components/text\"));\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"App\">\r\n      <LazyComponent />\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhen i do the above i get an error saying  **ctor is not a function**\r\n### Stack trace\r\n```\r\nreact-dom.development.js:11455 Uncaught TypeError: ctor is not a function\r\n    at readLazyComponentType (react-dom.development.js:11455)\r\n    at mountLazyComponent (react-dom.development.js:15476)\r\n    at beginWork (react-dom.development.js:16247)\r\n    at performUnitOfWork (react-dom.development.js:20285)\r\n    at workLoop (react-dom.development.js:20326)\r\n    at renderRoot (react-dom.development.js:20406)\r\n    at performWorkOnRoot (react-dom.development.js:21363)\r\n    at performWork (react-dom.development.js:21273)\r\n    at performSyncWork (react-dom.development.js:21247)\r\n    at requestWork (react-dom.development.js:21102)\r\n    at scheduleWork (react-dom.development.js:20915)\r\n    at scheduleRootUpdate (react-dom.development.js:21610)\r\n    at updateContainerAtExpirationTime (react-dom.development.js:21636)\r\n    at updateContainer (react-dom.development.js:21704)\r\n    at ReactRoot.push../node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js.ReactRoot.render (react-dom.development.js:22017)\r\n    at react-dom.development.js:22169\r\n    at unbatchedUpdates (react-dom.development.js:21492)\r\n    at legacyRenderSubtreeIntoContainer (react-dom.development.js:22165)\r\n    at Object.render (react-dom.development.js:22240)\r\n    at Module../src/index.js (index.js:8)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:781)\r\n    at fn (bootstrap:149)\r\n    at Object.0 (serviceWorker.js:135)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:781)\r\n    at checkDeferredModules (bootstrap:45)\r\n    at Array.webpackJsonpCallback [as push] (bootstrap:32)\r\n    at main.chunk.js:1\r\n```\r\nIt's likely i'm doing something wrong. I've also attached a working demo below\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce \r\nWorking demo https://codesandbox.io/s/nn5ozqpz5j\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIdeally this should lazy load the component, i.e the suspense fallback prop, should say loading first and then the text should be loaded in the parent\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nOS: OSX El capitan 10.11.16\r\nReact Version: 16.8.6\r\n",
