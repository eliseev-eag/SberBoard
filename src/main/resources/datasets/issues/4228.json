  "body": "Though this change may not exactly create a “mirror,” I wanted to at least start a discussion around a problem that we have begun to run into when modules from separate domains listen for the same action and experience value collisions. For example:\n\n``` js\n// modules/audio/constants/ActionTypes.js\nvar AudioPlayerActionTypes = keyMirror({\n  PLAY: null,\n  PAUSE: null\n});\n\n// modules/video/constants/ActionTypes.js\nvar VideoPlayerActionTypes = keyMirror({\n  PLAY: null,\n  PAUSE: null\n});\n```\n\nBoth an audio player and a video player would implement some type of play button within a UI layer that, when clicked, runs through an action creator that eventually reaches the Dispatcher and ultimately sends a `'PLAY'` action out into the parent application. If the media components are only listening for a `'PLAY'` action to be dispatched, _both_ will unintentionally begin playback.\n\nOne solution would be to namespace keys in each constants file:\n\n``` js\n// modules/audio/constants/ActionTypes.js\nvar AudioPlayerActionTypes = keyMirror({\n  AUDIO_PLAYER_PLAY: null,\n  AUDIO_PLAYER_PAUSE: null\n});\n\n// modules/video/constants/ActionTypes.js\nvar VideoPlayerActionTypes = keyMirror({\n  VIDEO_PLAYER_PLAY: null,\n  VIDEO_PLAYER_PAUSE: null\n});\n```\n\nThis works, but is overly verbose and repetitive in my opinion (`VideoPlayerActionTypes.VIDEO_PLAYER_PLAY`.) By adding a prefix option, the keys remain slim, with their namespace still denoted by the object they are members of, but avoids any value collisions.\n",
