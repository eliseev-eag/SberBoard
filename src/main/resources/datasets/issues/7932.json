  "body": "So currently when rendering, you must provide some top-most wrapper in addition to the node that has been designated as the reactroot. This introduces an unwanted extra layout element and can make styling a little irritating. \n\nIt would be nice if the target for `ReactDOM.render(jsx, node)` _is_ the topmost node and you could pass an array as the first children right away. \n",
