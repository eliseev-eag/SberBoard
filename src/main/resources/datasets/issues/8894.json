  "body": "When consuming React from source with the Google Closure Compiler, [this bit](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/eca5b1d48e71218800156ce474ec79b990b09fbd/src/renderers/shared/stack/reconciler/instantiateReactComponent.js#L26-L32) of code isn't being run in the correct order.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the Google Closure Compiler transformation is changing the function to a `var` assignment. It messes up the behavior because the original `instantiateReactComponent` function is hoisted. My thought is it's related to the fact that the `instantiateReactComponent` function is exported from that module. \r\n\r\nAnyway, this produces an error because the assignment to `ReactCompositeComponentWrapper.prototype` is now in the wrong order (assignment -> function definition, when we want definition -> assignment).\r\n\r\nThis may also be related or the root cause of #8887.\r\n\r\nThe most straightforward solution is to bring the `Object.assign` call after the function is declared, which I've verified works correctly. I'm happy to submit a PR with the described approach.",
