A good example would be a timeoutId, could be for some custom debouncing.\r\n\r\n    class SomeComponent extends React.PureComponent {\r\n      handleSomething() {\r\n        clearTimeout(this.timeoutId);\r\n        this.timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {\r\n          // do something\r\n        }, 1000);\r\n      }\r\n      // ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow I don't have `this` anymore. I don't see how to have a timeoutId for each component instance except using `useState`:\r\n\r\n    const SomeComponent = () => {\r\n      const [timeoutId, setTimeoutId] = useState(null);\r\n      const handleSomething = () => {\r\n        clearTimeout(timeoutId);\r\n        setTimeoutId(setTimeout(() => {\r\n          // do something\r\n        }, 1000));\r\n      }\r\n      // ...\r\n    };\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIn the last example using state to store the timeoutId feels wrong because I'm triggering a re-render (I think) but `timeoutId` is irrelevant for the rendering step.\r\nI feel like I should store it elsewhere but where ?\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16.8+\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe title is specific to my issue but it is a generic problem, everywhere I used to have instance member I'm now forced to put everything in states.",
