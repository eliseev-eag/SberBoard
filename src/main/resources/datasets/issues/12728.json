  "body": "I think this separation makes sense, if for no other reason than it helps with the mental model. A Timeout determines the threshold before a suspend \"effect\" turns into an error. A Placeholder is like an error boundary that pattern matches on those errors.\r\n\r\nDepends on https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12279. Opening this separately, since it's not needed for the basic functionality and it's debatable whether these are the right primitives.",
