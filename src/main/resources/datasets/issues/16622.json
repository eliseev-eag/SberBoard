  "body": "\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n*feature*\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n[as demonstrated here, \"Why did this render?\"](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16437#issuecomment-524892514) does a great job reporting what prop changed, but it does not yet report which _nested_ value changed for props that are comprised of nested objects.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe \"why did this render?\" shows a collapsible tree with the \"leaf\" value that changed inside the prop object displayed.\r\n\r\nA couple use cases this would benefit:\r\nIn some cases, it is most convenient creating props that are nested objects. For instance, maybe you need to pass an object to a library, and you'd like to avoid storing the individual object items as separate prop variables such that you don't need to redefine them together as a dict later on, but changes are due to a single element in the dict that you'd like visibility on in react devTools.\r\n\r\nIn rarer cases, it is unavoidable having props that aren't nested objects. For instance, how could I preserve the `.prototype` key of my `props` object without react stripping it? If I wrap my props inside an object, that key can be preserved. But now *all* my props are considered 1 prop to the profiler and I have no visibility on which prop changed. With this change, I could expand the tree and drill down to which individual values changed.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nNew feature never before released in React DevTools. I am using `16.8.6`\r\n",
