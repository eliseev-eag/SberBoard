  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nA **bug** in snapshots.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIt seems that there is a problem with the snapshots when you use other libraries like [`antd`](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design). The snapshot launch:\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'ownerDocument' of null\r\n```\r\nIf I mock all the library, the snapshot is almost empty.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and either a repl.it demo through https://repl.it/languages/jest or a minimal repository on GitHub that we can `yarn install` and `yarn test`.**\r\nYou can download this **example** of my Github account: [https://github.com/aaronplanell/ant-design-issue_5428](https://github.com/aaronplanell/ant-design-issue_5428)\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/aaronplanell/ant-design-issue_5428\r\n$ cd ant-design-issue_5428\r\n$ npm install\r\n$ npm test\r\n```\r\nIn the `README.md` you will find, step by step, the full proccess.\r\n\r\nBesides, I opened an issue to `antd`: [https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/5428](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/5428) and @yesmeck said me that was a problem of Jest/react-test-renderer. \r\n\r\nThen I opened an issue to `jest`: [https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/3195](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/3195). This time @thymikee confirmed what @yesmeck said, it's a problem of react-test-renderer.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI expect that the snapshot have the full HTML code in JSON format. It has no sense that snapshots fail if a library that you use (and works!) use `refs`.\r\n\r\n**Please provide your exact configuration and mention your Jest, node, yarn/npm version and operating system.**\r\nI use this dependencies:\r\n```\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"react-scripts\": \"0.9.5\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"antd\": \"^2.8.2\",\r\n    \"react\": \"^15.4.2\",\r\n    \"react-dom\": \"^15.4.2\",\r\n    \"react-test-renderer\": \"^15.4.2\"\r\n  },\r\n```\r\nWith this OS: Ubuntu 16.04\r\n",
