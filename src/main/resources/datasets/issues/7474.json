  "body": "Discussed in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7428. I'm finally to a point where I feel good enough about this code and I thought I'd make it easier to comment on it.\n\nThis is a reimplementation of https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7359 that additionally eliminates much of the work done inside of ReactDOMInput to handle quirks associated with `defaultValue`, `value`, `defaultChecked`, and `checked`.\n\nIt does this by ensuring a specific order for property assignment on the `input` element. This is implemented within `DOMProperty` and `HTMLDOMPropertyConfig`, which may allow for other elements to eventually take advantage of it (should they need it).\n## Performance changes\n\nSince they do less work, controlled inputs are slightly faster, while non-ordered HTML tags have no observable performance regression (in my ability to test, anyway). \n## Fixes from the original PR\n\nThis is a major deviation from my solution in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7359, but it includes the same input fixes. These are enumerated in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7253#issuecomment-236074326. Basically, since the mutation method for `value` first checks to see if the property is loosely the same, it eliminates many edge cases with controlled number inputs, like:\n- Controlled and uncontrolled numbers won't drop off decimal places when backspacing, like converting `3.` to `3`\n- Controlled numbers that use `parseFloat` or `parseInt` won't \"expand\" values, like magically replace `3e1` with `30`.\n## Other fixes\n\nSome fixes are no longer necessary inside of `ReactDOMInput`:\n- Assigning `type` and `step` before `value` for IE11\n- Properly ordering `defaultValue`/`value` for inputs to ensure date inputs display properly on Android and iOS.\n- Ensure `defaultChecked` does not influence `checked` in Chrome 50.x\n\n---\n\nThis is a big change. I don't expect it to be merged easily. If there is any additional documentation I can provide, or benchmarks you would like to see, I am happy to produce them.\n",
