  "body": "ReactTransitionEvents currently contains two methods, `addEndEventListener` and `removeEndEventListener`.  In most (perhaps all) cases, the developer is going to wait for `listener` to be called `n` times (where `n` is usually `1`), and then call `removeEndEventListener`.\n\nLet's make this nicer, changing the preamble of `addEndEventListener` to something like:\n\n``` javascript\n  addEndEventListener: function(node, eventListener, stepsInTransition = 1) {\n    var metaListener = (event) => {\n      stepsInTransition--;\n\n      if (stepsInTransition > 0)\n        return;\n\n      eventListener(event);\n\n      if (stepsInTransition == 0)\n        this.removeEndEventListener(node, metaListener);\n    }\n\n```\n\nto make the event listener clean up after itself.\n\nThe real implementation is slightly more complex than that, as you'll have to keep track of the original `eventListener` to make sure `removeEndEventListener` does the right thing if it's called before `add` is done, but in principle, this seems like an improvement.\n",
