  "body": "If I use laravel, react js and mysql for building a site like yelp or tripadvisor then will it be a good option or not? Which rendering (CSR or SSR) approach will be good for the website? Initially, I want to stay in monolithic architecture and 1 year later i will go for microservice architecture, so which method should i follow to make this shifting easier (mono to micro)? Moreover, my target is to make the site progressive web app from the very beginning. So need suggestion from you guys.",
