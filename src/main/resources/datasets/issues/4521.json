  "body": "Currently, ReactClass just loops through lifecycle methods when being created and attaches to prototype of `Constructor` function or sets to null.\n\nI think the `ReactPerf` and `ReactDefaultPerf` would benefit from having ReactClass do an `if (__DEV__)` check during this phase and re-route lifecycle methods through `ReactPerf.measure`.\n\nThis would allow more advanced metrics down the line about lifecycle methods being executed. I think I have a PR ready if this is something that should be in core; which I think it is. \n",
