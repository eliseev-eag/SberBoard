  "body": "When upgrading to 16.0.0 from 15.6.1, react-test-renderer started failing on my tests with the message:\r\n> test renderer is not available in production mode.\r\n\r\nI have in fact been running unit tests using this renderer during my production build.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to understand: why was this restriction introduced?  I saw the change was made in #9514 but couldn't find any explanation on the pull request or the documentation as to why production mode is now disallowed for this renderer.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAlex",
