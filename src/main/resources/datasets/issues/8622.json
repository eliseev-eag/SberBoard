  "body": "I recently [broke the `jest:coverage` Grunt task](https://circleci.com/gh/facebook/react/411?utm_campaign=vcs-integration-link&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github-build-link) in my [`bvaughn:shared-context-stack` branch](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8611) because I added new invariants/warning messages and regenerated the error codes JSON file. I was confused because master appeared to be broken as well. It turns out that this was due to a caching issue in our preprocessor. This PR makes that caching strategy aware of the error codes JSON file.",
