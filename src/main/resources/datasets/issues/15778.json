  "body": "This won't work on CI since `pretty-format` uses `react-is` internally, and since yarn finds `react-is` in this repo, it won't install it. I don't know how to tell yarn to install a version of `react-is` into `pretty-format`s `node_modules`? To test this locally, I just did `cp -R ../jest/node_modules/react-is node_modules/pretty-format/node_modules` which worked fine. Maybe @arcanis can help?\r\n\r\nAll tests pass locally ðŸ™‚ \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n~This contains #15779 with the upgrade to jest 24 applied on top of it~",
