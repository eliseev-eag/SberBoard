  "body": "On thing I like about React is that we can still use it for micro apps (where small portions of the website need user interaction, but a declarative UIs can still simplify development a lot), without having to setup a whole build environment, that for this use cases looks definitely overkill.\r\n\r\nI know I may sound like a grumpy grandpa,but I'm worried that this will be not be true anymore in React 16:\r\n\r\n- With the deprecation of `React.createClass` and `React.PropTypes` we will need external modules for sure. Then we need to bundle that modules for the browser and expose them as globals. We can't just load React from a CDN and write code anymore.\r\n\r\n- Also when using `create-react-class`, warnings are still issued, like *getDefaultProps is only used on classic React.createClass definitions. Use a static property named `defaultProps` instead.* Maybe this is in fact a bug?\r\n\r\n- Possibly more issues?\r\n\r\nAm I wrong? If not, should we stick with React 15, or what? Maybe we can start making React builds specifically for non-ES6 environments, bundling needed external modules, etc?",
