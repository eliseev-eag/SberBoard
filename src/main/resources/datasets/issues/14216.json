Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst React = require('react')\r\nconst ReactDom = require('react-dom/server')\r\n\r\nconst result = ReactDom.renderToString(\r\n  React.createElement('script', {\r\n    crossOrigin: 'anonymous'\r\n  })\r\n)\r\n\r\nconsole.log(result)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe w3c spec as well as [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_settings_attributes) refer to `crossorigin` being lowercased, I'm not sure if this affects anything as most of the html parsers I tried while investigating (w3c validator and cheerio) worked fine with `crossOrigin` not being lowercase.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThe reproduction uses latest React (`yarn add react react-dom`)\r\n",
