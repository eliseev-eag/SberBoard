  "body": "Hey,\n\nI'm working on a react app, it's quite big. We use Backbone.Model and React for the views. When a Backbone.Model's attributes is update we call this.forceUpdate() on the React component. Sometime (not all the time), the events are not binded so clicking won't do anything. \nI'm not sure why this is happening, I can see that the DOM has the react-id in there. Not sure where to start from. \nAnyone has experienced this?\n",
