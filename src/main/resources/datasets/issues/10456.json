  "body": "This fixes a regression that @nhunzaker found in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10142 where `select` elements were defaulting to the first `option`, regardless of whether it was disabled or not. This was not the behavior in 15.6. Copying my comment on this from Nate's PR:\r\n\r\n>This issue stems from https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8349 which introduced an `updateOptions` call when a `select` element is mounted.  If`updateOptions` doesn't find a matching `option` it [defaults to setting the first `option` as selected](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/ca46c5278fe24dd9f564918d30e454033278e054/src/renderers/dom/fiber/wrappers/ReactDOMFiberSelect.js#L110-L112).\r\n>\r\n>In previous versions `updateOptions` was not called on the initial mount, so it defaulted to the standard behavior of the browser.\r\n\r\nThis brings us back in sync with the HTML spec which states:\r\n\r\n> If the select element's display size is 1, and no option elements in the select element's list of options have their selectedness set to true, set the selectedness of the first option element in the list of options in tree order **that is not disabled**, if any, to true.\r\n\r\nhttps://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-elements.html#the-select-element\r\n\r\n\r\n@nhunzaker I can just cherry-pick the DOM fixtures from #10142 as part of this PR if you'd like!\r\n",
