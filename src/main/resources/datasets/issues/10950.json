  "body": "from some previous discussions, I gather that there is a way to render the whole tree when it's ready (e.g. flushSync / updateContainer) - however, I don't see a way to get a callback when it's completed. Is that possible via one of the builtin functions?\r\n\r\nThe way I'm dealing with it now is to make sure my root node is a higher order component and then put my callback logic in `componentDidUpdate()`. It seems to work so far, but it would be better if this could be a little closer to the metal (yet still only after the entire tree is definitively reconciled and previous renders finished)\r\n\r\nThanks again!",
