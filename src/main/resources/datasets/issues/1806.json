  "body": "Is it possible to depend on react just once?\n\n```\n\"dependencies\": {\n  \"react\": \"~n.n.n\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd then have every single react-related thing across my entire stack call into the same react code? And also be able to require .jsx files everywhere, and not pull unnecessary code into the client bundle (e.g. the jsx transformer). It's okay if I have to do slashes in my requires:\n\n```\nrequire('react/this')\nrequire('react/that')\n```\n\nI mainly want to avoid confusing mystery-bugs like this one: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1165 It seems error-prone to have to pull in all these different tooling utils that may have slightly different versions of react.\n",
