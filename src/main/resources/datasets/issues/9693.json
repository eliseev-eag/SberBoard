  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nI had a component that was dispatching a redux action in its `componentWillUpdate`, which causing things to blow up in confusing ways.  For instance, it was causing a different component's `componentWillReceiveProps` to get called for the second time before its `componentDidUpdate` got called, which led to various NPEs during the reconciliation process.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt would be nice if anything that would trigger an update to during a call to a component's `componentWillUpdate` would immediately error out in dev mode, even if it's causing a different component to update (in my case, triggering an ancestor `react-redux` container to update).  Would that be possible?\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nI'm seeing it with React 0.14.9 and Chrome on macOS.  I can't say for sure if my code caused the same bugs with previous versions of React, but the blame rests on my code anyway.",
