I suspect if it was possible to do `render = () => { ... }` this would not be an issue, but that syntax is blocked by the TSD for react. I'm not sure if this is a react bug or a TSD one.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI'm running 15.4.2, Chrome on MacOS but i can reproduce in FF and Edge on Win 10 as well. I haven't used older versions but i suspect it was there.\r\n",
