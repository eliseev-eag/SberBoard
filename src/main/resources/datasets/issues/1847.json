  "body": "Although react/lib/cx is very handy, it's a shame that it's based on an object syntax, whereby the key must be static.\n\nI think it would be very handy to allow for dynamic keys in the react/lib/cx helper class. This could work using a (nested) array syntax.\n\nI've made a quick improvement, see what you think:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/joecritch/c4ae91c3e5e56bc48cac\n",
