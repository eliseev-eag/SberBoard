  "body": "This is related to #2461. Essentially if we wrap a render call in a try catch this works the first time. It seems like when `React.render` is called a second time (the update case) it does not work. It seems that  `React.render` is async when updating an existing component tree. \n\nI may be missing something but it seems like this leaves no way for developers to catch errors when rendering children components.\n\nI have a JSBin demoing this issue here: http://jsbin.com/mifedepada/edit?js,console,output\n",
