  "body": "Note: This is for the experimental event API.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the creation of `EventComponent` state to always happen in the complete phase, rather than happen lazily upon the first event firing. This ensures that state is consistent, otherwise a component that hasn't had state created (because an event didn't fire), will likely break in the unmount phase because state is expected to exist. I added a test that validates this behaviour.\r\n\r\nI also removed the `currentResponder` binding as it is no longer used anywhere and was just dead code.",
