  "body": "From looking at an early implementation of custom Fiber renderer (https://github.com/manaflair/mylittledom/blob/master/sources/term/react.js#L437) it seems there is a callback that is not in the official renderers: `scheduleAnimationCallback()`\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there's a callback in the official renderers which is not in the tutorial/example at https://github.com/nitin42/Making-a-custom-React-renderer -  `scheduleDeferredCallback()`\r\n\r\nLastly, both of these are referenced in the guide at https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture\r\n\r\nSo this begs the question - are custom renderers meant to implement these? If so, what are the best practices for doing so?\r\n\r\nIn a more general sense - do custom renderers have any relationship with setting ProrityLevels or _affecting_ the scheduler?\r\n",
