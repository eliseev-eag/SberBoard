  "body": "## The versioning scheme is actually quite childish and doesnt comply with any industry standard. \n\nmajor.minor.patch\n\nmajor - this will break previous libraries that use this\n\nminor - this adds new functionality/features\n\npatch - something is broken\n\n0 indicates that its still in development and anything can change at any time. Yet people are already using your product in production and relying heavily on it.  You send a message to your end users that you do not care about them or their compatibility issues by not using semantic versioning. \n\nNodeJs finally moved to real semantic versioning with IOJS merged in they are now up to 4.1.2 and clearly explains the backward compatability issues with the different versioning. \n",
