  "body": "I'm totally fine with the current exhaustive-deps implementation, yet I feel like it would be cool to have an option to tell plugin about constant values that will never change. \r\n\r\nMinimal example:\r\n```jsx\r\nconst AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {\r\n  const { http } = useContainer(); // container is immutable\r\n  const [user, setUser] = React.useState(null);\r\n  \r\n  // exhaustive-deps wants to see \"http\" present in the deps list\r\n  React.useEffect(() => void http.get('/whoami').then(setUser), []);\r\n\r\n  ...\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wonder what options are available to make eslint happier. I believe some things could be done in AST/visitors layer, but no idea where to start.\r\n",
