  "body": "Recently some code was moved from React to ReactDOM. I get the idea behind this move.\n\nBefore, to do server side rendering, we had to use `React.renderToString`. This is neatly available on the global `React` object. \n\nAfter, we have to use `ReactDOMServer.renderToString`. The problem with this is that AFAIK, the `ReactDOMServer` object is not available in the global scope. So when we don't have access to the `require` function, this is problematic.\n\nMy server-side code (with Nashorn) is currently doing `React.renderToString` and this is still working, but for the upgrade to the newest React version I scoured the whole internet and the React source code but have not found a way to gain access to `ReactDOMServer` without doing:\n\n``` js\nvar ReactDOMServer = require('react-dom/server');\n```\n\n...which is not possible to do if there is no `require` function available...\n\nCan you maybe add a property `Server` to `ReactDOM` so we can get `ReactDOMServer` from the global `ReactDOM` object by doing this:\n\n``` js\nvar ReactDOMServer = ReactDOM.Server;\n```\n\n?\n",
