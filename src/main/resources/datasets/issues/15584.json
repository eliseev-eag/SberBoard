  "body": "In React we don`t have a rich component activity methods. I want tell about self controlled methods for component.\r\n\r\nNeed methods\r\n- this.mountComponent() - this method add component to DOM, and call from component instance\r\n- this.unmountComponent() - this method remove component from DOM, and call from component instance\r\n\r\nAbout Motivation.\r\nWe can remove component from DOM in Parent component, but need pass action (method) from parent to child, and in child component call method. It simple, but why required this steps?\r\nSimple way add methods mountComponent and unmountComponent, this be great!\r\n",
