  "body": "Resolves #11615\r\n\r\n**Problem**\r\nThis error happens because by default eslint ignores [dotfiles](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/lib/cli-engine.js#L246). The `yarn linc` command can supply dotfiles like `.eslintrc.js` causing this error because of the mismatch between the ignore patterns and what is being given as lint input. [This](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/4828) eslint thread talks about this issue with this [PR](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/6844) resolving it.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nHidden files will now be linted, but not hidden folders. As of now the only hidden `.js` file seems to be the `.eslintrc.js`, but this will prevent this from happening if any are added in the future. As a bonus the `rc` file will be linted going forward.\r\n\r\nHappy Thanksgiving! ðŸ¦ƒ",
