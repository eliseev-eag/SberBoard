Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nWhy not use wepack preset env to build react it, we can build xxx.react.es6.min.js xxx.react.es2017.min.js, xxx.chrome65.min.js or something like that? Or is there anyway we can clone the source code and build it by ourselves? After all, react + react-dom is pretty huge itself, sometimes, it is even bigger than the logical code.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.x\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free to close it if you guys think it is worthless.",
