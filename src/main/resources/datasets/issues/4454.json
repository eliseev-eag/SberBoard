  "body": "Hello, when i updated to the latest version of react everything was wonderful but I started to notice something really important... Sometime the components that i created weren't there... so I started to debug my code and I found i made an exception inside the render function, something like \n\nThis is an stupid example but it only to show an example...\n\n```\nvar object1 = undefined;\nconsole.log(object1.name);\n```\n\nSo i never saw that error on the console... I just don't see anything...\n\nThis error was making me crazy... so i stated to debug React code and i found something and i don't know if its a bug or i need to solve it in a different way...\n\ninside react.js\n\n```\n_renderValidatedComponent: function(childContext) {\n    var renderedComponent;\n    var previousContext = ReactContext.current;\n    ReactContext.current = this._mergeChildContext(\n      this._currentElement._context,\n      childContext\n    );\n    ReactCurrentOwner.current = this;\n    try {\n      renderedComponent =\n        this._renderValidatedComponentWithoutOwnerOrContext();\n    }\n    finally {\n      ReactContext.current = previousContext;\n      ReactCurrentOwner.current = null;\n    }\n```\n\nhere we can see the \"try\" haven't got a \"catch\"... after i added the \"catch\" the console started to show the errors inside my render function...\n\n```\n_renderValidatedComponent: function(childContext) {\n    var renderedComponent;\n    var previousContext = ReactContext.current;\n    ReactContext.current = this._mergeChildContext(\n      this._currentElement._context,\n      childContext\n    );\n    ReactCurrentOwner.current = this;\n    try {\n      renderedComponent =\n        this._renderValidatedComponentWithoutOwnerOrContext();\n    }\n    catch (ex) {\n      console.error(ex);\n    }\n    finally {\n      ReactContext.current = previousContext;\n      ReactCurrentOwner.current = null;\n    }\n```\n\nI hope this is ok and its not my mistake...\n\nThanks!\n",
