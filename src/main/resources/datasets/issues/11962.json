  "body": "This fixes Node resolution mechanism in built packages and accomplishes two goals:\r\n\r\n* We can now use Node.js shell inside `packages/node_modules` which is handy for manual testing.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"498\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-01-04 at 6 17 57 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/34578833-5e3e1d10-f17e-11e7-9c69-f576e845eae6.png\">\r\n\r\n* We can now use `link:` instead of `file:` in fixtures. This is important because previously Yarn would cache the fixtures until the version change. So it was easy to accidentally test a cached previous version of React in a fixture. Now they always point to the latest build output.\r\n  \r\nI verified that the build completes and all fixtures work. I haven't tested the release manager directly but hopefully my changes make sense.\r\n\r\nBtw, I considered keeping `build/packages` and setting up `build/packages/node_modules` with symlinks as an alternative but in the end it seemed less straightforward than just putting them in a folder called `node_modules` in the first place.\r\n  ",
