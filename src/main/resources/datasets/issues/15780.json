It [used to exist in React15](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/15-stable/src/renderers/dom/ReactDOM.js#L32) and got deleted. It still [exists in ReactDOM/server](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/3b2302253f13c9cd049fac10784e10b6c582e3b6/packages/react-dom/src/server/ReactDOMServerNode.js#L22), and it appears to be [typed in @typed/react-dom](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/react-dom/index.d.ts#L25) so I am assuming it got deleted by mistake.",
