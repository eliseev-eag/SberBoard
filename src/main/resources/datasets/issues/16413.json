  "body": "Currently when using the react dev tools on Firefox OSX, I am unable to change the current zoom level. The default zoom level is quite small so even with good eyesight, I struggle to read it on a high resolution display.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to adjust the zoom level of the Firefox dev tools as a whole, by focusing the panel and using CMD +/-. However the React dev tools does not respect this and has no option to switch the zoom level manually. As a result, the react dev tools extension is unusable on Firefox. I would imagine this is a bigger issue for anyone with poor eyesight.\r\n\r\nCan we please add some accessibility options or fix this behaviour?",
