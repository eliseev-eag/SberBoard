  "body": "It would be nice to be able to override or extend ReactHostComponent.createInternalComponent to expand the set of elements that can be rendered beyond html.  In extjs-reactor we are doing this by patching the createInternalComponent function so that any tag that starts with a specified prefix (the default is x-) creates an Ext JS Component: https://github.com/sencha/extjs-reactor/blob/master/packages/reactor/src/index.js#L14\r\n\r\nI'd love to have a more stable way of doing this.  It looks like something along these lines was originally considered, but never fully implemented and recently removed:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/commit/461a74115caf103b46d1ba93d3cba6fa7780d009\r\n\r\nDo you have any advice for a more sustainable approach or would you consider an API for this?\r\n",
