  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen a component is rendered into document root via a Portal, it does not receive context from parent components.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nThis is an example using React Bootstrap Overlay, which seems to be using portals (https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-overlays/blob/master/src/Overlay.js):\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/931bnzp4/2/\r\n\r\nReact DevTools shows the overlay component in a completely separate subtree, if that means anything. But it definitely calls `createPortal`, confirmed by stepping through overlays source.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nContext should be visible inside the overlay component.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nThis worked with previous context implementation, as seen in the fiddle.",
