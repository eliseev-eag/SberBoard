  "body": "We have behaviour divergence for act() between prod and dev (specifically, act() + concurrent mode does not flush fallbacks in prod. This doesn't affect anyone in OSS yet.)\r\n\r\nWe also don't have a good story for writing tests in prod (and what from what I gather, nobody really writes tests in prod mode).\r\n\r\nWe could have wiped out act() in prod builds, except that _we_ ourselves use act() for our tests when we run them in prod mode.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a compromise to all of this. We will log a warning if you try to use act() in prod mode, and we silence it in our test suites. (Any discrepancies in behaviour will still be caught by assertions). \r\n\r\nWe will revisit this in a future version. ",
