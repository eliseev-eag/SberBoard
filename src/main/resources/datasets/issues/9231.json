  "body": "This is a feature request.\r\n\r\n**Current behavior:**\r\nIf `ReactDOM.render()` is called using a component name that is declared later in the same file, the resulting error suggests that the component wasn't exported from the file it was defined in.\r\n\r\n> Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in.\r\n\r\n**Example code where the suggestion is inappropriate:**\r\n```javascript\r\nvar mountNode = document.getElementById(\"mountNode\");\r\nReactDOM.render(<HelloMessage name=\"Jane\" />, mountNode);\r\n\r\n// oops!!!\r\nclass HelloMessage extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe suggestion does not help in this instance.  It would be helpful if the error message also suggested that ReactDOM.render() may have been called too early.  For example:\r\n\r\n> Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you tried to render the component before it was declared in the current file.\r\n\r\nI am an experienced ES6+ developer, but new to React.  I just finished the tic-tac-toe tutorial and was attempting to apply what I had learned to one of my web sites when I made the above mistake.  Since this mistake is plausible to be made by someone just getting started (especially if they are taking the tutorial code as their starting point, and are new to ES6+), it would be useful to suggest the alternate possible fix.  It might help other beginners out there.\r\n\r\nIf this is OK, I'll send a PR ASAP.  Thank you for your consideration.\r\n\r\nThis is on the latest version of React and should affect all environments.  Thank you.\r\n",
