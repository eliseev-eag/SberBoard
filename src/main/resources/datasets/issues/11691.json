  "body": "Seems like it's too easy to use `spyOn` when we shouldn't. Let's blacklist it in favor of explicitly-scoped spy methods.\r\n\r\nThere is a comment in `scripts/jest/setupTests.js` that I don't understand. It says:\r\n> // TODO: Stop using spyOn in all the test since that seem deprecated.\r\n\r\nWhy do we think `spyOn` is deprecated? The official Jest docs list [`jest.spyOn` as being available for 19.0.0+](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/jest-object.html). Is this comment maybe referring to the call-through behavioral differences or something?\r\n\r\nI also updated `scripts/jest/spec-equivalence-reporter/setupTests.js` and `scripts/jest/typescript/jest.d.ts` although neither is necessary at this time.",
