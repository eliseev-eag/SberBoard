  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIn order to contribute to React, I was going through the coverage results to find code which needs additional testing. While doing that, I noticed that the coverage results appear incorrect\r\n\r\nFor example file `packages/create-subscription/src/createSubscription.js`, notice that coveralls says branches are not covered on [L16](https://coveralls.io/builds/18690124/source?filename=packages/create-subscription/src/createSubscription.js#L16) which is actually a function call.\r\n![coveralls](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16024985/44702510-a1940600-aa48-11e8-89b7-3585693bb658.png)\r\n\r\nWhen I ran jest in my workspace with `--coverage`, it gave if/else path are missing on the same line 16 as shown in the screenshot:\r\n![coverage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16024985/44702557-e3bd4780-aa48-11e8-8923-18b619b5dd93.png)\r\n\r\nThis appears to be a bug.",
