  "body": "Currently selecting a portion of \"Seconds Elapsed: \" text in the stateful component example at http://facebook.github.io/react/ is only possible between update ticks, as usual with most template renderers. It would be more impressive if string concatenation inside a single div were replaced with a comma or explicit span elements, so that only the number would change. Also if there would be an extra span after the number, such as \" s\", even selection over the changing number would be retained.\n\nRetention of selection could also be noted in that frontpage example -- preserving copy-paste is quite major win over traditional templating solutions, when pages become ever more lively.\n",
