  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\n\nbug\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\n\nProviding a `defaultValue` to an HTML5 number input causes the element to enter into some sort of _semi-controlled_ mode. Changing the `defaultValue` should be a noop after the element has been mounted, but it seems to set a property in the element and break the behavior of the uncontrolled component.\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.**\n\nSee this fiddle and try to enter `1e8`: http://codepen.io/3lux/pen/yJkWoj\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n\n`1e8` should show up in the input box; since some DOM property is being changed when the provided `defaultValue` is changed, I think the DOM is trying to programmatically set the input to an interim value that's not a real number, like `1e` and then wipes it out and resets to an empty string, which is caught in the `onChange` handler and persisted back to the `defaultValue`, effectively losing the input.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\nLatest React, latest Chrome\n",
