  "body": "New to React. I was following the tutorial and ran into a snag. Copy pasting the example\n[Transferring with ... in JSX](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/transferring-props.html#transferring-with-...-in-jsx) example lead to `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token {` on line 2 on Chrome. \nI was using the in-browser JSX transformer.\n\nIt took me awhile to figure out this is a proposed JavaScript thing and not a built-in React thing. `<script type=\"text/jsx>` needed to be `<script type=\"text/jsx;harmony=true\">`. This is super unclear from the documentation/tutorial. To me, it reads as if somehow React is taking care of this or it's a React specific syntax; not ES6. The docs link out to the Destructuring assignment, but I think the docs should clearly state \"Your browser / environment must support ES6 harmony for this to work.\"\n",
