  "body": "Update links to use https:// where it is supported. There's probably a lot\nmore that could be fixed, but these are the core ones I found (especially\nthe download links in order to prevent MITM attacks). Note that there are\nsome fb.me links that will redirect to http:// even while accessed over\nhttps://, but this seemed like the best way to fix those for now.\n\nNOTE: Only non-third-party files were modified. There are references to\nhttp:// URLs in vendored/third-party files, but seems appropriate to fix\nupstream for those rather than editing the files.\n\nAlso, copy one image locally to the blog, as it was hotlinking to a site\nthat did not support https://.\n\nLast, use youtube-nocookie.com instead of youtube.com for video embeds,\nas the former doesn't try to set a cookie on load (privacy enhancement).\n",
