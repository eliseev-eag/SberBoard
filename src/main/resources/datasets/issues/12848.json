  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nProbably a bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI have a standard CRA app and getDerivedStateFromProps is called before the render and then each time new props are passed to the component. This is as expected.\r\n\r\nBut when the same code is run trough ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup for SSR, render method is called BEFORE getDerivedStateFromProps.\r\n\r\n...from the documentation: getDerivedStateFromProps is invoked after a component is instantiated as well as when it receives new props. \r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nreact 16.3.2",
