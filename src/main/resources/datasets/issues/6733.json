  "body": "tried upgrading React from 0.14.8 to 15.0.2 but have run into an issue with SVG which seems to be related to a change in the way React emits the clip-path css property.\n\nI have the following in my jsx (simplified):\n\n```\n <clippath id=\"clip-above\"><path /></clippath>\n <path style={{clipPath:'url(#clip-above)'}} />   \n```\n\nReact 0.14.8 emitted the following:\n\n```\n<path style=\"clip-path: url(#clip-above)\" />\n```\n\nReact 15.0.2 produces the following \n\n```\n<path style=\"clip-path: url(\"#clip-above\")\" />\n```\n\nNote the quotes around #clip-above, which are new. The clipping does not work in 15\n",
