  "body": "Supersedes PR #11279 and #12092. Resolves issue #12038\r\n\r\n~~Perhaps we could use this in React DevTools as well?~~ (This would not be the case in its current form, since this library accepts React _elements_ and DevTools receives _fibers_.)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nIn addition to the newly-added unit tests, I ran `yarn build react-is` locally to build this, then `npm pack`ed the result and installed it in a fresh project. I also tested the UMD build in CodeSandbox.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n```js\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\nimport {\r\n  ContextConsumer,\r\n  ContextProvider,\r\n  isContextConsumer,\r\n  isContextProvider,\r\n  typeOf\r\n} from \"react-is\";\r\n\r\nconst ThemeContext = React.createContext(\"blue\");\r\n\r\nisContextConsumer(<ThemeContext.Consumer />); // true\r\nisContextProvider(<ThemeContext.Provider />); // true\r\ntypeOf(<ThemeContext.Provider />) === ContextProvider; // true\r\ntypeOf(<ThemeContext.Consumer />) === ContextConsumer; // true\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Assumptions\r\n* It is okay that `isElement` is looser than `typeOf` (e.g. it returns true for host elements, fragments, strict-mode, context, etc.)\r\n* There are no additional component types (e.g. the experimental call/return types) that we want to expose for the initial release.\r\n* It's okay to support the (currently unstable) `AsyncMode` for the initial release.\r\n* This package should mirror the version of React rather than be versioned independently (since we'll be adding types over time).",
