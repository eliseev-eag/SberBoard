  "body": "Context providers are currently popped one too many times if an error is thrown by a context-provider's `render` method. In this case the begin phase is exited before context is _pushed_ but we still _pop_ it in.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a test for this behavior (failing before) and fixes it by ensuring that we always push context before continuing (or unwinding). FWIW we plan to further clean-up and improve the handling of context-related code soon so this specific fix might be short-lived.\r\n\r\nThis PR relates to #8593.\r\n\r\n#### Remaining work\r\n- [ ] Replace the try/finally approach with one of the ones mentioned in [this comment](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8604#issuecomment-268672297).\r\n- [ ] Verify the changes mentioned [this comment](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8604#issuecomment-268684971) are fixed by the final solution",
