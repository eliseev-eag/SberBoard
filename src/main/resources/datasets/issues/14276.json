  "body": "This PR is a follow up to https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/14218. In that PR, fields that we were unsure about were `null`ed out. This changes the `null`ing out of fields to the two that we know are safe to `null` out â€“ specifically, `memoizedState` and `updateQueue`. This stops the memory leak we encounter when the associated fibers containing the references to the closures (stored in memoizedState) still exist after being unmounted",
