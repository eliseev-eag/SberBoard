  "body": "_Possibly not a React bug, but I haven't been able to reproduce in vanilla JS/HTML/CSS so far._\n\nDemo: http://jsfiddle.net/cjqg0y48/1/\n\nI encountered this when I tried to fade in a component that contains [react-swipe](https://github.com/jed/react-swipe) which uses a plain JS library under the hood. It seems like the call it makes to getBoundingClientRect() magically neutralizes the transition, causing it to have no effect.\n\nOne workaround seems to be deferring the getBoundingClientRect() call using setTimeout. (Thanks GreenJello on #reactjs)\n",
