Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/918pvqz1vw\r\n\r\nClick the button, then click the \"Click me second\" with the blank href. You'll still get directed to the URI specified in the unrendered anchor.\r\n\r\nNotice that if you inspect the element you don't see the href in the document tree.\r\nProviding the anchor with a key fixes it.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nYou should not get redirected to the URI specified in the unrendered anchor.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16, haven't checked other versions yet.\r\n\r\nChrome 70.0.3538.110 64 bit\r\nSafari 12.0.1\r\n",
