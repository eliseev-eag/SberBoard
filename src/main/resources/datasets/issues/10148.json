  "body": "**what is the change?:**\r\n - Removes the now-inaccurate description of behavior around duplicate\r\n   keys\r\n - Adds link to 'key' docs page\r\n - Changes tone to be more casual and friendly\r\n\r\nAlternative wording idea;\r\n'Encountered two children with the same key, ${key}\r\nChild keys must be unique; using duplicate keys is not supported and\r\nwill cause unexpected behavior in some versions of React.\r\nSee https://fb.me/react-warning-keys for more information on how to\r\nfix this.'\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nMainly this change was needed because in React 16, duplicate keys will\r\nnot cause omission of items with duplicate keys. All items will be\r\nrendered. It could happen that in future versions of React we will have\r\ndifferent behavior though.\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\n`yarn test`\r\n\r\n**issue:**\r\nWishlist item on https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8854",
