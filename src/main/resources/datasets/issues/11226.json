  "body": "Related to #9834 \r\n\r\nThis is my first contribution to this repo, so let me know if I'm missing anything. I'm not sure where/how the documentation is generated, so I only added doc-style comments to the added function, but I can work on it too if it's in a different place.\r\n\r\n~I'm not satisfied yet with the code duplication (from the `traverseAllChildrenImpl`), so I'm going to try and add a `testFunc` argument to `traverseAllChildrenImpl`, so that React.Children.find reuses it. Any feedback is appreciated.~\r\n\r\nI've reused `traverseAllChildrenImpl` to minimize code duplication. The trade-off is that now that function is a bit more complex, with all the if/else branches from the \"isFinding\" mode, and that it returns either a number or the child, depending on the mode. Let me know if code duplication is preferred instead (or another solution).\r\n",
