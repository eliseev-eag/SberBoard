It should have a `code` property as well.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if you want to use the `keyboardEvent`'s  `code`, you must access it through `SyntheticKeyboardEvent`'s `nativeEvent`.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nAffects React 16 and earlier (I assume).\r\n",
