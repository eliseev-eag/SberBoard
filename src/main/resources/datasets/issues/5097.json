  "body": "I caused an infinite loop by calling this.setState in componentDidUpdate. The warning I received was \"Maximum call stack size exceeded\" and the stack only showed React code, never any of my product code. As a result this was super hard and time consuming to track down.\n\nAny thoughts on detecting this bad behavior somehow and giving a nicer error message?\n",
