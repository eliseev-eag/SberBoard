  "body": "Not an issue with React, but more a workflow issue for github and the issue tracking workflow. For example, there are plenty of issues labeled `Difficulty: beginner` but when looking through those issues many of them have already been claimed for someone to work on, or in many cases a PR has already been submitted. After digging through a half dozen issues like this, one just tends to give up. It would be helpful to be able to see only issues that are still truly looking for contributors.",
