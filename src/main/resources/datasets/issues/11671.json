  "body": "I know that this question was asked many times, but it is still doesnâ€™t clear. Many people just said:\r\n\r\n> Pass props to constructor if you want to access this.props there\r\n\r\n[one more example of the answer](https://discuss.reactjs.org/t/should-we-include-the-props-parameter-to-class-constructors-when-declaring-components-using-es6-classes/2781/7)\r\nOficial doc says: \r\n\r\n> Class components should always call the base constructor with props\r\n\r\nBut if we do not pass props to `constructor`, we will still have `this.props` everywhere except `constructor`.\r\nAlso from [source code of Create Element](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react/src/ReactElement.js) you can see that `createElement `adds `props `regardless if you use `super(props)`\r\n**So the main question is**: Why React official doc says:\r\n\r\n> Class components should always call the base constructor with props\r\n\r\nif it is not really necessary? So current React doc is wrong or what? There is no need to call `constructor `always with `props `?",
