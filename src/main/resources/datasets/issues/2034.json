  "body": "It appears that in order to access the real DOM in a cross-browser way, we need to use something like jQuery. React is slowly chipping away the need to include jQuery, such as normalizing events. Does it make sense to go further? For example, doing this:\n\n```\nvar node = this.getDOMNode().querySelector('.someclass')  // native\n```\n\nInstead of this:\n\n```\nvar node = $(this.getDOMNode()).find('. someclass').get(0)  // jQuery\n```\n\nI realize that may be out of scope of React. If this has already been discussed somewhere and decided upon, we can just close this ticket out. \n\nBut one beautiful thing about React is that it _usually_ allows us to alway work with a first-class DOM. But occasionally we need to reach into the actual DOM and get our hands dirty. It would be awesome to not have to load jQuery just for this, or deal with cross-browser issues. \n\nBecause so much of the native browser is recreated in React (like virtual DOM selection and events) is there a way to access the real DOM without having to rebuild jQuery? Are there references to real DOM nodes in the virtual DOM? Other clever tricks? \n\nThere may already be a way to do this that I didn't see. Again, this may be out of scope, but I thought I would ask. Thanks!\n",
