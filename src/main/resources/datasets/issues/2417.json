  "body": "The new JSX spread syntax introduced in 11.2 and described here:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/sebmarkbage/07bbe37bc42b6d4aef81\n\nis very nice, but when I compile JSX that uses this feature, I see it is implemented with Object.assign. Since this is a proposed ES6 feature that is only supported in Firefox 34, using JSX spread syntax necessitates using a polyfill for Object.assign. It would be great if this were not the case, and seems like it should be possible to implement this behavior without Object.assign.\n",
