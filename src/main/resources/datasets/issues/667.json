Not directly linked from the site yet as there may still be some minor issues with it.\n\nI'll eventually split `html-jsx-lib.js` into another project (react-tools?) as it could be used elsewhere. I think it'd work with Node.js if a module like jsdom was used to implement the DOM functionality.\n",
