  "body": "We move any spies on `console.error()` from `beforeEach()` to the individual `it()` tests. This means that if a new test is introduced in these suites, it does not ignore warnings by default, but fails on any unexpected warning, which is Jest's default behavior.\n\nWe also change a few old instances of direct `console.error = jest.genMockFn()` assignment to use `spyOn()` for consistency with the rest of the tests.\n\n---\n\nMostly did this on a whim after noticing inconsistency between calling `spyOn()` in `beforeEach()` and `it()`. Feel free to ignore :smile: .\n\nReviewers: @zpao \n",
