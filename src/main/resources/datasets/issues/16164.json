  "body": "For Fabric we want to rename `unmountComponentAtNode` to `stopSurface` to be consistent with `startSurface`. Because `unmountComponentAtNode` is called from native code (see ReactInstanceManager), we can't just delete it yet. Once this change syncs, I'll clean up usage of `unmountComponentAtNode` in native code, then I'll come back and remove it completely.\r\n\r\nFor more context, see https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/305058178e144d4709606ea42d0edb9d864b33c5 (and additional discussion on D16273720 for fb employees). This PR also updates the binding I create in that diff for bridgeless mode to refer only to stopSurface.",
