  "body": "This adds support for conditional Keyboard responder propagation, for where there are nested keyboard responders. To allow a `onKeyDown` or `onKeyUp` event to propagate the callback is required to return `true` to propagate a single responder level. This is done by providing a new method on context called `continuePropagation` – which tells the responder propagation system to propagate a single level after processing the current responder (of the same responder type).\r\n\r\nI also had to remove the usage of `invokeGuardedCallbackAndCatchFirstError` when calling the user-land event callback. This was because the existing `invokeGuardedCallbackAndCatchFirstError` doesn't support returning a value from the callback – which is what we need here. Attempting to change the mechanics of the function seemed far too invasive, so we can test this approach out internally to see if we run into any issues (we shouldn't though).",
