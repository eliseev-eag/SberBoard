Scheduler will yield at the end of the current frame, even if there is no pending input.\r\n\r\nWhen `isInputPending` is not available, this has no effect, because we yield at the end of every frame regardless.\r\n\r\nReact will call `requestPaint` in the commit phase as long as there's at least one effect. We could choose not to call it if none of the effects are DOM mutations, but this is so rare that it doesn't seem worthwhile to bother checking.",
