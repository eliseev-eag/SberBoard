  "body": "When its used:\r\n- error messages\r\n- dev tools\r\n- HOCs\r\n\r\nI would argue that its valuable only in `DEV` mode. Even when it comes to error messages I think I've never seen any production log containing it, I cannot be sure though if it never is.\r\n\r\nAnd if its valuable only in DEV mode, shouldnt we just ditch adding them (or write a ditching transform/codemod) as they can be inferred from the functions/classes/variables anyway? The only remaining use case would be using `displayName` for HOCs.\r\n\r\nIf Im wrong let me know. This would however fix 2 minor problems:\r\n- smaller build outputs (slightly)\r\n- remove problem of unintentionally preventing tree-shaking of SFCs in flat bundles (more can be read [here](https://iamakulov.com/notes/polished-webpack/))\r\n",
