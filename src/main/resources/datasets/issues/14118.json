  "body": "**What**\r\n\r\nThis PR makes some improvements to the DOM test fixtures to make it easier to test older versions of React.\r\n\r\nHere's a link:\r\nhttp://react-hydration-fixture.surge.sh/hydration\r\n\r\n**Why**\r\n\r\nAfter trying to figure out the origin of a few DOM bugs recently, it gave me some motivation to figure out how we can make that faster. I wanted to quickly test when a bug started or stopped, but discovered my only option was a lot of npm install + build/test across commits.\r\n\r\nI think we can do that better, and I think the hydration fixture provides a good foundation for that. If we can figure out a way to host commit-level builds, we could very quickly pass through a range of commits to triage an issue in the browser. \r\n\r\n**Updates**\r\n\r\n- Updating the App component to use a class instead of a function lets us support all fixtures down to 0.11\r\n- For really old versions, I generalized the React version picker and added it to the hydration fixture. It can now override the current version of React and supports down to React 0.4.0\r\n- Create a wrapper around findDOMNode for older React\r\n- A small UX fix for the error message on the Hydration Fixture\r\n- Additional documentation in the fixtures as to when key API changes happened. \r\n\r\nI don't want to support all the way back to 0.4.0 for all test fixtures, but I think having some utilities to do it quickly would be useful.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/590904/48043752-e07fbf80-e14d-11e8-9128-be903f22d3aa.png)\r\n",
