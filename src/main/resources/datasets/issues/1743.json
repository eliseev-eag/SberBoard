  "body": "I was unsure where to ask this. Let me know if I should post it somewhere else.\n\nI have a question regarding todomvc-flux example and the dispatching of actions in Flux. \nI was watching a video describing the Flux architecture, and the presenter mentioned ([at 12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYkdrAPrdcw#t=740)) that \"once an action goes to the store you can't put another one in until the stores are completely finished processing it\". She [the presenter] mentions this several times later in the video.\n\nIs this supposed to be a principle property in the Flux architecture?\n\nI was looking at the [todomvc-flux](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/examples/todomvc-flux) example, and it doesn't seem to obey this property.\n",
