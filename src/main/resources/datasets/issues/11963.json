Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n1.Go to react/fixtures/dom \r\n2. Run yarn start or npm start\r\n\r\nFollowing errors can be seen in the terminal \r\n`> react-fixtures@0.1.0 prestart /home/gmadmin/Practice/react/fixtures/dom\r\n> cp ../../build/dist/{react,react-dom}.development.js public/\r\n\r\ncp: cannot stat '../../build/dist/{react,react-dom}.development.js': No such file or directory\r\nnpm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE\r\nnpm ERR! errno 1\r\nnpm ERR! react-fixtures@0.1.0 prestart: `cp ../../build/dist/{react,react-dom}.development.js public/`\r\nnpm ERR!

Running \"cp ../../build/dist/{react,react-dom}.development.js public/\" this command on terminal works fine. But when it fails when run through \"prestart\" command in package.json.\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\ncopying should happen successfully and  npm start should successfully turn up the server. \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? \r\nReact \"version\": \"16.2.0\",\r\nkernel : \"4.4.0-53-generic GNU/Linux\"\r\nos info: {\r\n   Distributor ID:\tLinuxMint\r\n   Release:\t18.1\r\n   Codename:\tserena}\r\nDid this work in previous versions of React?\r\nDon't know\r\nIf its a bug,  let me work on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
