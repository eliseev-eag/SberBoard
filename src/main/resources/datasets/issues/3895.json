  "body": "I have this fiddle:\n\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/8502\n\nMy exception (which may not be correct) is that if I click on the first `test` text, the console should log `test1`.  If I click on the second `test` text that is within the button, the console should log `test1` and `test2`.\n\nChrome and Safari behave the way I expect however with FF 38.0.1, IE 10, and IE 11, when I click on the second `test` text within the button, the console only logs `test2`.  If my understanding of event handling is correct, when I click on the text within the button (which is the `Ic` component), that component should trigger it's `onClick` event and then bubble it up to the `Bu` component which should then trigger it's `onClick` event.\n\nWhy would FF and IE not trigger the `Ic` `onClick` event handler when it is within the `Bu` component but it triggers fine when it is not in another component?\n",
