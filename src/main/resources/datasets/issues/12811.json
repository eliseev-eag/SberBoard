This can happen when a component repeatedly calls setState inside componentWillUpdate or componentDidUpdate. React limits the number of nested updates to prevent infinite loops.”\r\n\r\nHowever, we can’t reliably reproduce this error and it only affects a small percentage of our users. Moreover, we have more than 1,000 in-house components and several third-party components. So, it’s impractical to audit every single component to find out what caused it.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt would be much easier for us to debug if, when the nested update count exceeds 1,000 (current NESTED_UPDATE_LIMIT), we could see what components are involved in this nested update chain.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nWe are using React 16.3.1.",
