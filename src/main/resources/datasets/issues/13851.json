For some components, such as the `ScrollView` in `react-native`, this means that the method does not find all elements that are eventually rendered by type. \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe expected behavior is to have `findByType()` navigate through `props.children` of each element to see if any of the `children` are of the type being searched for. E.g., \r\n\r\ncomponents:\r\n```\r\n<ScrollView>\r\n    <View />\r\n    <View />\r\n</ScrollView>\r\n```\r\n\r\n`findAllByType(View).length` should return `2`, but currently returns `0` because the `children` of the above `ScrollView` component is empty: the `props.children` of that component has the components of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nThis is currently the case with \r\n```\r\n    \"react-test-renderer\": \"^16.5.2\"\r\n    \"react\": \"16.3.1\",\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Please let me know if I can clarify anything.** ",
