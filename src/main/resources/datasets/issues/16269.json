  "body": "Adds a feature flag that disables the legacy context API. The feature flag is turned off in open source builds. Strict Mode is already a mechanism that warns about it, but this feature flag actually makes `this.context` always an empty object, and `context` argument to functions always `undefined`. So it's a way to enforce it. If we later offer \"modern\" builds, we can turn it on there by default. For now, I want to use this internally for newly written code.\r\n\r\nNo whitespace: https://github.com/facebook/react/compare/master...gaearon:ctx?expand=1&w=1",
