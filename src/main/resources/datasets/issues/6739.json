  "body": "Hello!\n\nI know that this might not be the best place to ask but I cannot seem to find a better place to do so, and both React and the said application are built by you (you being Facebook Inc.)\n\nSo, we built this react application, this is a demo page: https://bookingbutton.winearound.com/en/554b39bffd2618f777e4a533?lang=en\nThe main issue arises when we want users to share the link on Facebook for other people to view/book the same cellar/event.\n\nThe page loads fine on all desktop browsers, all Android devices we tested (also in the Facebook WebView), all iOS devices using Safari but cannot load in the Facebook WebView in a range of devices going from iPhone 4 to 6S, iPad 2 and Nano and iPod Touch (we don't have access to all iOS devices but we found the same behavior in all the tested ones)\nWe put all kind of shims to support also legacy browsers, we also render it using PhantomJS and it works fine, the only issue comes from the Facebook WebView on iOS.\n\nWe use https://rollbar.com/ to track the console outputs but nothing is thrown when accessing it from the Facebook WebView, it simply won't load and now we are clueless on what to do next.\n\nThose are our package.json dependencies:\n\n```\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"babel-polyfill\": \"6.5.0\",\n    \"classnames\": \"^2.2.3\",\n    \"es6-promise\": \"^3.1.2\",\n    \"google-map-react\": \"^0.10.6\",\n    \"isomorphic-fetch\": \"^2.2.1\",\n    \"moment\": \"^2.11.2\",\n    \"moment-timezone\": \"^0.5.3\",\n    \"nuka-carousel\": \"^1.0.2\",\n    \"react\": \"0.14.7\",\n    \"react-day-picker\": \"^1.3.0\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"0.14.7\",\n    \"react-dropdown\": \"^1.0.2\",\n    \"react-helmet\": \"^2.3.1\",\n    \"react-intl\": \"2.0.0-pr-3\",\n    \"react-modal\": \"^0.6.1\",\n    \"react-phone-input\": \"^1.0.2\",\n    \"react-redux\": \"4.4.0\",\n    \"react-router\": \"2.0.0\",\n    \"react-router-redux\": \"3.0.0\",\n    \"react-share\": \"^1.4.1\",\n    \"redux\": \"3.3.1\",\n    \"redux-act\": \"0.3.0\",\n    \"redux-form\": \"^4.2.0\",\n    \"redux-thunk\": \"1.0.3\",\n    \"updeep\": \"0.13.0\",\n    \"validator\": \"^5.1.0\"\n  }\n```\n",
