  "body": "This PR changes the logic that occurs in `interactiveUpdates`, to account for a scenario that proved problematic in the testing of React Flare â€“ the mixing of both event systems on the same app. Note: this change is behind the experimental event API. Also included in this PR are:\r\n\r\n- `interactiveUpdates` -> `discreteUpdates`\r\n- `flushInteractiveUpdates` -> `flushDiscreteUpdates`\r\n- Adds `batchedEventUpdates` and a new `BatchedEventPhase` to scheduler\r\n\r\n## Discrete events use timeStamp to manage flushing\r\n\r\nNow that the Flare event system and the existing event system co-exists, we've noticed far more flushing is occurring; which is problematic for cases where this behaviour was non-existant with only the existing event system. To counter this a `timeStamp` heuristic has been added by reading the `timeStamp` from the `window` object. We will probably want to change this to be an argument (rather than reading from window) in the future, but I didn't want to introduce too many changes in this PR.\r\n\r\nThe `timeStamp` is an important field on events, as it allows us to tell what events were part of the same real-world interaction. For example: `mouseup`, `pointerup` and `click` all should have the same `timeStamp`. If we know that they're all the same `timeStamp`, we can do a single flush for them all, which improves compatibility with Flare and also should improve runtime performance as we're flushing sync less.",
