Siblings should continue rendering and if the parent is a Placeholder, the promise should be captured by that Placeholder.\r\n\r\nWhen the promise resolves, rendering resumes. If the resolved value has a `default` property, it is assumed to be the default export of an ES module, and we use that as the component type. If it does not have a `default` property, we use the resolved value itself.\r\n\r\nThe resolved value is stored as an expando on the promise/thenable.",
