  "body": "The title may be not very clear but my example is easy to understand\n\n``` javascript\n// The key is set correctly here\nvar childs = [\n<Child key={\"1\"}/>,\n<Child key={\"2\"}/>\n]\n\n// The key is not set correctly here\nvar childsWrapped = childs.map(function(c) { return <Wrapper>{c}</Wrapper>; });\n```\n\nI often have to put wrapper components around other components and find out that often I forget to put back the key attribute on the wrapper.\n\nIf the child already has a key, the wrapper could perhaps also uses that key automatically?\n\nDon't know if this is possible nor a good idea, just wondering :)\n",
