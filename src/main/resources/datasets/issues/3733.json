  "body": "I'm upgrading a relatively large codebase from React 0.12.x to 0.13.x. I've hit a variety of warnings, the latest being:\n\n> Warning: Any use of a keyed object should be wrapped in React.addons.createFragment(object) before being passed as a child.\n\nExploring the stack starts to give me hints of the culprit, but in this case it's a `div` element and one of very many. Is there anything I or React can do to make these warnings more debuggable?\n",
