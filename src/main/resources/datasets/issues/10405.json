  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIn React 16, ReactDOM removes server rendered content before rendering it again. (tested on 16.0.0-alpha.12). For applications with a big component tree, this is perceivable by the user.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem\r\n\r\nI have reproduced the bug here.\r\n\r\nTiny app:\r\n1. There's a box component which is rendered on the server with `renderToString` and sent to the \r\nclient.\r\n2. The client loads bundle.js which contains the same component.\r\n\r\nI have a added debugger in `componentWillMount` for the box component to show this\r\n(open your dev tools)\r\n\r\nReact 15.6.1: https://recon-15.now.sh/\r\nReact 16.0.0-alpha.12: https://recon-16.now.sh/\r\n\r\nCode is here: https://github.com/siddharthkp/react-16-reconciliation-bug\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nReactDOM should perform reconciliation without removing content. (React 15 had this behavior)\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nBrowser: Chrome\r\nCurrent version: 16.0.0-alpha.12\r\nPrevious version: 15.6.1",
