It should be the other way around. `this.setState`'s callback feels like it is called immediately after the state is updated, but actually `shouldComponentUpdate` method is called before the callback.\r\n\r\nHere's the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/n5u2wwjg/123856/ Open devtools and you'll see in console what I'm trying to say.\r\n\r\n**Fiddle**\r\n\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/n5u2wwjg/123856/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI believe callback should be called before shouldComponentUpdate\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nAll",
