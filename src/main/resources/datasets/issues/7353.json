  "body": "I'm asking if, in the light of #5753, it would be possible to also return plain text from `render()` as an alternative to the current `ReactElement` return type such that one would not have to wrap it in an element. Could the same comment-wrapping method allow for this also for render methods?\n\n``` js\n// Before\nreturn <span>{this.props.text}</span>;\n// After\nreturn this.props.text;\n```\n\nMotivation is that it is sometimes hard to get layout to work as expected if one has to introduce span elements, and the alternative is to write plain functions instead of react components to produce the expected result. It would be syntactically nice to be able to componentize text-only components the same way as \"html-enabled\" components.\n",
