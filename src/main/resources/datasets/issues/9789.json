  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug possibly in React or Google Chrome\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nScroll position is not preserved when children of an element list change order. Bug seems to apply only when React keys of the child elements are unchanged. \r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\n\r\nDemo available here: https://jsfiddle.net/930m9grq/3/\r\n\r\nBroken case:\r\n\r\n0. (Resize the demo window until it's scrollable [if not already])\r\n1. Scroll to bottom of the window\r\n2. Click on the refresh button on the left\r\n3. Window will scroll up automatically\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nWindow should keep the scroll position.\r\n\r\nWorking case:\r\n\r\n0. (Resize the demo window until it's scrollable [if not already])\r\n1. Scroll to bottom of the window\r\n2. Click on the refresh button on the right\r\n3. Window will not scroll up (expected behavior)\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nTested React version was 15.5.4. Older versions were not tested.\r\n\r\nAffected browsers:\r\nOSX 10.12.5 / Google Chrome 58.0.3029 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\nOSX 10.12.6 (Beta 1) / Google Chrome 59.0.3071.71 (Official Build) beta (64-bit)\r\n\r\n**Not** affected:\r\nOSX 10.12.6 (Beta 1) / Firefox 53.0.2 (64-bit)\r\nOSX 10.12.6 (Beta 1) / Safari Version 10.1.2 (12603.3.1)",
