  "body": "DevTools v4 added a pretty powerful new component filtering feature that enables devs to filter out components by type, name, or file system location. Because these filters can be a bit elaborate to create, they are saved between sessions to improve dev experience.\r\n\r\n**Unfortunately, I don't think I am going to be able to support the persistence functionality for React Native.** (In other words, filters will be forgotten each time you reload the app.)\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is a mix of timing and context. The biggest limiting factor is the lack of a synchronous storage option. React Native has a couple of faux sync storage options, but they just in-memory wrappers around an async storage layer and they require async initialization. That _could_ work if the React Native backend waited to initialize DevTools until it also initialized the async storage layer, _but_ this has implications on reload-and-profile support (#336).\r\n\r\n---\r\nOriginally reported via https://github.com/bvaughn/react-devtools-experimental/issues/337",
