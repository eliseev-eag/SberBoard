  "body": "Every time I decide that I want to learn React, I google and find some tutorial, from seemingly reputable sources.    Then I try a few things, google more; go to stack-overflow and very quickly i realize that the syntax is different between different web-sites ..  the API keeps changing, and I don't know if I'm looking at an old tutorial, or a new one -- I have no way of determining if a stackoverflow question is going to apply because of the version of React that I'm using.\r\n\r\nWhat I think is needed is some kind of master list that's based on an \"era\" of the API.  I'm not talking about semver which is too low-level.  I'm talking about something like:\r\n\r\nFirst when React came out, this is how we did things...  and every one was happy.\r\n\r\nThen came the Silver Age of React, where we did things the following way..  We took this out, and we put this in.  So if you see this thing, that's old, from the Golden age.   \r\n\r\nThen we hit the Bronze era -- and this is where we split everything into tiny pieces, and now you have to be more specific, blah blah blah.\r\n\r\nThat can serve as a cheat-sheet for anyone new to make sense of what's going on.\r\n\r\nIt's kinda similar to how if I look at a piece of C#, I could say, \"yeah, this is circa-2005\" or, \"oh, this looks very 2010ish.\"\r\n\r\nthanks for listening.
