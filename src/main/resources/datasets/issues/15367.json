  "body": "Increase the suspended time based on how long we've already waited.\r\n\r\nThe theory is that a person [can't tell the difference between small differences in time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-noticeable_difference). Therefore, if we wait a bit longer than necessary that won't translate to a noticeable negative difference in the experience. However, waiting for longer might mean that we can avoid showing an intermediate loading state which is a positive difference. The longer we have already waited, the harder it is to tell small differences in time. Therefore, the longer we've already waited, the longer we can wait additionally. At some point we have to give up though. We pick a train model where the next boundary commits at a consistent schedule.",
