  "body": "I see the warning, so I add keys, typically the id of the associated model. But... when I subsequently update state, if the key is the same, it seems like that component is passed over, even though it's data model has changed.\n\nDoes my confusion make sense? I can try and package up a simple example if not. It seems like you are doing similar things to what I'm trying to do (a helper function which returns an array of JSX components which I then put into a render return stmt), but it seems like your examples work, and you don't need to specify explicit keys.\n\nLoving the speed btw - I'm migrating my little hobby project over from ember to react, and things are literally night and day in terms of performance. awesome work.\n",
