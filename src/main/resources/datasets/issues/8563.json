  "body": "In #2756 we ended up using toLowerCase to allow case insensitive HTML tags. However, this requires extra processing every time we access the tag or at least we need to process it for mount and store it in an extra field which wastes memory.\r\n\r\nSo instead, we can just enforce case sensitivity for HTML since this might matter for the XML namespaces like SVG anyway.\r\n\r\nWe introduced runtime validation of tag names because we used to generate HTML that was supposed to be inserted into a HTML string which could've been an XSS attack.\r\n\r\nHowever, these days we use `document.createElement(tagName)` in most cases. That already does its internal validation in the browser which throws. We're now double validating it. Stack still has a path where innerHTML is used and with this change we still apply validation there. However in Fiber we can remove it completely since we only use `document.createElement(tagName)` and never generate HTML.",
