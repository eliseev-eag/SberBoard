  "body": "I'm using `TapEventPlugin` to open a drawer when you tap an icon.  After you tap, the icon is covered with a scrim that will close the drawer if you tap it separately.\n\nOn my Chromebook Pixel touchscreen and on an iPhone, this works splendidly.  On my Nexus 5, the icon is getting a touchtap while my finger is still touching it.  Then, when I lift my finger, it sends another tap to the scrim, which closes the drawer.\n\nHere's a [sample repo](https://github.com/appsforartists/isomorphic_react_test) that demonstrates the bug.  I'll see if I can isolate the root cause and send in a PR.\n\nThis is most likely related to #2061.\n",
