  "body": "This is mechanical refactor. This removes a small level of indirection in favor of a more direct relationship between how these internals are exported and accessed. One new thing here is that unlike the old `shared/ReactSharedGlobalState`, the new `shared/ReactSharedInternals` can be imported from React itself without a cyclical dependency — thanks to a Jest and Rollup mock. I'll need that later.\r\n\r\n* Replaces `ReactSharedGlobalState` with `ReactSharedInternals` which match the secret field 1:1.\r\n* This makes it easy to shim the module so `shared/ReactSharedInternals` can be imported either in renderers *or* in `react` package itself. Without the shim, we can't make `shared/ReactSharedInternals` truly \"universal\" — which is necessary to allow `warning` to automatically read the stack in the future.",
