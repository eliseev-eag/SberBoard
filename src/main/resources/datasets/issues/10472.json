  "body": "This shim file added complexity to FB's internal build configuration since it provided a the same module name as the \"real\" feature flag switch. Because of this, the shim was recently removed (internally). This PR removes it from GitHub as well so it won't be re-added with the next sync. ðŸ˜„ \r\n\r\n`ReactNativeFeatureFlags` is still configured to be an external (although strictly speaking, at this point we could remove _that_ ability since we fork before even requiring the specific renderer implementation).\r\n\r\nAll this will go away soon anyway when we delete stack but it seemed worth doing now _in case_ we did more syncs between now and then.",
