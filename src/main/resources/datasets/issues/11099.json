  "body": "I would like to report a bug.\r\n\r\nIn re-filing another outstanding bug that was closed despite being reproducible, I decided to create a repro case.  \r\n\r\nSince the repro involves setting `defaultValue` on a `<select>`, I confronted the human inability to remember whether HTML is zero-indexed or one-indexed.\r\n\r\nSince the repro also involves determining whether a given `<option>` is selectable, I decided to just have a control with four `<option>`s and to select 3, to see which I'd get - the third or the fourth.\r\n\r\nJoke's on me.  I got neither.  I got the first selectable `<option>`.\r\n\r\n[A winner is testcase](https://stonecypher.github.io/is_react_2803_still_a_problem/).  If the series is 1-indexed you should see `joe`; if 0-indexed you should see `stan`.  Instead you see `bob`.\r\n\r\nAs such I currently believe that `defaultValue` is not honored on `select`.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time I've noticed this.  I have only tested it under `16.0.0`.",
