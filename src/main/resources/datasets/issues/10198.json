  "body": "This pull request adds a new home screen for the DOM test fixtures that should make it easier to produce test cases without having to setup React locally. Additionally, it provides a \"file github issue\" button that will generate a new issue with auto-populated browser information:\r\n\r\n![example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/590904/28267459-20d00638-6ac8-11e7-96c5-a99b57d7ff0a.gif)\r\n\r\nCheck it out here:\r\nhttp://react-dom-fixtures.surge.sh\r\n\r\n## Why this PR is so big\r\n\r\nIn order for this to work, I'm leaning on Formidable's [component-playground](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/component-playground). Naturally, they import React using commonjs. This is problematic for our existing way of handling versioned React code: `const React = window.React`. Webpack can smooth this over using the [`externals`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/externals/) configuration, but that we can't (as far as I know) do that with `create-react-app`.\r\n\r\nSo I've ejected `create-react-app`, added this configuration, and updated all of the fixtures to use `import React` instead of `const React = window.React`. I've also tried my best to simplify/cut some fat, but this change set is bigger than I would have liked. \r\n\r\n## Other thoughts\r\n\r\nLong term, I would love to deploy this and make it a part of the release process. It would be awesome if we could farm out manual DOM testing to the community (though this is more of a pipe dream at the moment).",
