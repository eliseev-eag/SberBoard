  "body": "This reduces the code duplication as we have quite a few of them now. It's also nice to be able to see them all together. Note this is `shared/` so they're still duplicated between React and renderer packages.\r\n\r\nThe actual file savings are negligible (a few dozen bytes after gzip for combined bundles). This is mostly to make it better from code organization perspective.\r\n\r\nI tried putting them as a hidden export on the React object but this actually increased the size a bit because our secret export name is longer than the code this saves. ðŸ˜› Although maybe it would be nice to do in the future to fix cases like https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8379#issuecomment-264858787. For now I decided not to do it.",
