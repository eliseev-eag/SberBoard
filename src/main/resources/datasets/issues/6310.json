  "body": "This builds on #5193 and introduces an important, in my opinion, detail (constructor function name) that makes issues like #6306 more easily identified.\n\nAdditionally, this removes the mention of methods that have been removed (`setProps` and `replaceProps`).\n\nWhen using `onClick={this.setState.bind(this, nextState)}` by mistake, the error message says:\n### 0.14\n\n> Uncaught Invariant Violation: enqueueCallback(...): You called `setProps`, `replaceProps`, `setState`, `replaceState`, or `forceUpdate` with a callback that isn't callable.\n### After #5193\n\n> Uncaught Invariant Violation: enqueueCallback(...): You called `setProps`, `replaceProps`, `setState`, `replaceState`, or `forceUpdate` with a callback of type object. A function is expected\n### After this PR\n\n> Uncaught Invariant Violation: setState(...): Expected the last optional `callback` argument to be a function. Instead received: SyntheticMouseEvent.\n\n---\n## Why?\n- We don’t need to mention the APIs we removed (`setProps`, `replaceProps`).\n- `enqueueCallback()` is an implementation detail and is confusing to the user.\n- We have enough information to print the actual public API method name.\n- We need to make it clear what “callback” is. Many people don’t know these functions accept a callback. We need to tell them it’s the last optional argument.\n- Printing the constructor name (e.g. `SyntheticMouseEvent`) makes it much more clear why you get issues like #6306.\n- This error should also be enabled for `ReactDOM.render()` instead of just failing with a TypeError.\n- This adds tests.\n",
