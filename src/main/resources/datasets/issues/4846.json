  "body": "Fixes #4677.\n\nI updated the easy things that were in the translated docs where I could (basically script sources). We'll need a pass from the translators, but don't need to block on that.\n\nI pulled in #4131 here to see the complete product. It might actually make sense to land that on its own since it's pretty much the only that needs more work in 0.13 (namely the shrinkwrapping) I already have it pulled out for 0.13 branch (#4675). Alternatively we only do that in master and wait for the branch cut since that's soon.\n",
