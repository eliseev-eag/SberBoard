  "body": "**NOTE:** This may be an issue for React Router instead. If so, please inform me, and I will notify them.\n\nI'm using Webpack, react-router, and react.\n\nI got this error while using react-router with async routes and server-side rendering:\n\n``` shell\nbundle.js:1 Warning: React attempted to reuse markup in a container but the checksum was invalid. This generally means that you are using server rendering and the markup generated on the server was not what the client was expecting. React injected new markup to compensate which works but you have lost many of the benefits of server rendering. Instead, figure out why the markup being generated is different on the client or server:\n (client) <noscript data-reacti\n (server) <div data-reactid=\".1\n```\n\nMy routes.cjsx has this:\n\n``` coffee\n# Routes\npath: 'game'\ngetComponent: (location, cb) =>\n    require.ensure [], (require) =>\n        cb null, require './views/game'\n```\n\nIf I change it to this, I no longer get that error:\n\n``` coffee\n# Routes\npath: 'game'\ngetComponent: (location, cb) =>\n    cb null, require './views/game'\n```\n\nIs this a bug or something else?\n",
