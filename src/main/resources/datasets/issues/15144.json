Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nI'd be happy to create a minimal demo but really I have no idea how to reproduce this.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt should just load the app.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nI'm on macOS. I have this issue in all the browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari.",
