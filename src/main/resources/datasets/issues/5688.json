  "body": "I have the fairly rare, but given the internet by no means unusual, situation where I need to embed LaTeX code that needs to be interpreted later (by a MathJax, or KaTeX, etc). The following code doesn't work due to JSX intepretation of the bits inside `{...}`:\n\n```\n<p>\\[\n  p_1 = some\\ point, \\\\\n  p_2 = some\\ other\\ point, \\\\\n  distance = (p_2 - p_1), \\\\\n  ratio = \\frac{percentage}{100}, \\\\\n  new\\ point = p_1 + distance \\cdot ratio\n\\]</p>\n```\n\nUsing ES2015 tempating strings also doesn't work, because then the `\\` gets interpreted instead:\n\n```\n<p>{`\\[\n  p_1 = some\\ point, \\\\\n  p_2 = some\\ other\\ point, \\\\\n  distance = (p_2 - p_1), \\\\\n  ratio = \\frac{percentage}{100}, \\\\\n  new\\ point = p_1 + distance \\cdot ratio\n\\]`}</p>\n```\n\nAnd of coure, double escaping all the `\\` works but becomes _impossible_ to read or write:\n\n```\n<p>{`\\\\[\n  p_1 = some\\\\ point, \\\\\\\\\n  p_2 = some\\\\ other\\\\ point, \\\\\\\\\n  distance = (p_2 - p_1), \\\\\\\\\n  ratio = \\\\frac{percentage}{100}, \\\\\\\\\n  new\\\\ point = p_1 + distance \\\\cdot ratio\n\\\\]`}</p>\n```\n\nSo.. .is there a JSX feature that \"turns off\" interpretation for an element? Something like this, that treats the text inside the element as \"untouchable\"?\n\n```\n<p verbatim>\\[\n  p_1 = some\\ point, \\\\\n  p_2 = some\\ other\\ point, \\\\\n  distance = (p_2 - p_1), \\\\\n  ratio = \\frac{percentage}{100}, \\\\\n  new\\ point = p_1 + distance \\cdot ratio\n\\]</p>\n```\n",
