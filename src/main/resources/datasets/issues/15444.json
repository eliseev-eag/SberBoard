  "body": "### What is the problem with Chinese README's\n\nFirstly, we congratulate you for getting so much star by sharing this repository with humanity.\n\nBut it is very disappointing for non-Chinese speakers when one couldn't understand what a trending repository is about.\n\nWhen we see such a repo on trending, our minds are blurring like Gollum's.\n\n![Gollum Image](https://media.giphy.com/media/V4uGHRgz0zi6Y/giphy-downsized-large.gif)\n\nThere is a way **you can help** to solve this disappointment which I believe is experienced by many people who want to know more about your valuable work and appreciate it.\n\n### What we want:\n - Please add English translation of your README so you are sharing your work and knowledge with more people.\n\n### How this will help you:\n - More feedback to fix and improve your project.\n - New ideas about your project.\n - Greater fame.\n - ![SungerBob Image](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7absbD7PbTFQa0c8/source.gif)\n\n---\n\n_“Sharing knowledge is the most fundamental act of friendship. Because it is a way you can give something without loosing something.”_\n\n_**— Richard Stallman**_\n\n**Thank you!**\t\n\n > This issue created by `us/english-please` script. Please report on any error. Thank you!\n",
