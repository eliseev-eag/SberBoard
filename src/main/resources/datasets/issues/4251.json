  "body": "There is an asymmetry to EnterLeave event plugin. Since `mouseenter` is created from the relativeTarget of the `mouseout` event it fires even though the target is disabled. Since the `mouseleave` is the inverse, i.e requires that the disabled element fire a mouseout, it doesn't fire a `mouseleave` for the disabled element.\n\nI am pretty sure the correct behavior here is that neither event should fire if its target is disabled, since this mirrors `mouseout`. No idea if none-chrome browsers have the same behavior for which mouse events fire on disabled elements.\n\nAdditional caveat I just realized, React is probably also not firing `mousenter` events in the case where the mouse leaves a disabled element into a non disabled element\n",
