  "body": "JSX will infer the component's name from the variable assignment and specify the class's displayName accordingly.\n\nReally?\n\nThis is not available in a class instance of React. Not even if it is set explicitly. Also, componentDidUpdate prevState seems to be the current state... I'm not sure if this is because of how browserify is bundling the JS or what. for v0.11.2. I've tried everything and prevState always logs the current state post update.\n![selection_001](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2347221/4493857/faaa2f40-4a4c-11e4-8c47-0865e9e1de94.png)\n",
