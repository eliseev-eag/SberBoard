We've been neglecting testing it when adding new features â€” let's try to keep it working in the future.\r\n\r\n* `pure` components now show their name instead of `Unknown`\r\n* There was a naming mismatch because `lazy` components began work as `Unknown` but completed with real name. I fix this by canceling immediately and restarting right after they get the right tag. Seems a bit odd but probably okay for this corner case?\r\n* Suspense printed error boundary message which seemed misleading.",
