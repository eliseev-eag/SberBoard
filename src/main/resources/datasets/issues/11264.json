  "body": "It turns out that the scheduler is too coupled to how the DOM renderer works. Specifically, the `requestIdleCallback` model, and how roots are committed immediately after completing. Other renderers have different constraints for when to yield and when to commit work.\r\n\r\nWe're moving towards a model where the scheduler only works on a single root at a time, and the render phase and commit phase are split into distinct entry points. This gives the renderer more control over when roots are committed, coordinating multiple roots, deferring the commit phase, batching updates, when to yield execution, and so on.\r\n\r\nIn this initial commit, I've left the renderers alone and only changed the scheduler. Mostly, this involved extracting logic related to multiple roots and moving it into its own section at the bottom of the file. The idea is that this section can be lifted pretty much as-is into the renderers. I'll do that next.",
