  "body": "A component's state is an integral part of a component, and usually, when exists, has an important part affecting the behavior of the component. Allowing devtools to instrument the state could help users understand what causes the component to render the way it does, locate bugs etc. It could also allow cool features, such as time travelling a component's inner state. \n\nWhile thinking about how to enable instrumentation of state updates, we had a few different ideas in mind. Eventually, we decided the cleanest, and helpful, way is to add a onStateChanged event to the ReactDebugTool, and emit a change event everytime a component changes its state. That way any devTool could hook on that specific event, and get notified for state changes. For convenience, we also added getState to ReactComponentTreeDevtool. \n",
