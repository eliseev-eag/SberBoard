  "body": "I am developing an external component (let's say `my-component`, which I link to the project with `npm link` (as it is in process and I need the package to reflect changes).\n\nIn the `my-component` folder there are `node_modules/react` and `node_modules/react-dom` as they are its dependencies. However they are peerDependences, so I did not suppose to bring them into the project linking this package.\n\nHowever when using `npm link`, it link the whole directory, including `node_modules`. So, when the project builds, it includes packages 2 times: from `node_modules/*` and from `node_modules/my-component/node_modules/*`.\n\nThis begins to affect when the component is using `ReactDOM.findDOMNode`, it causes this error:\n\n```\nWarning: React can't find the root component node for data-reactid value `.0.2.0`. If you're seeing this message, it probably means that you've loaded two copies of React on the page. At this time, only a single copy of React can be loaded at a time.\n```\n\nAlso, it may help to understand what's happening: the problem only appears if there are both `node_modules/my-component/node_modules/react` and `node_modules/my-component/node_modules/react-dom`. If there is only one of them, there is no error message.\n\nThe usual package installation does not bring such error as there is no `node_modules/react-dom` there.\n\nHow is it supposed to develop an external component and the project at the same time?\n",
