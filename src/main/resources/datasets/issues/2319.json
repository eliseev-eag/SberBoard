  "body": "I was a moron and had two separate React components both responsible for the same div:\n\n```\nvar Component1 = React.createClass({\n    render: function() {\n        React.renderComponent(<Component2/>, document.getElementById('my_div'));\n        return (<div id=\"my_div\"><span>Some stuff goes here</span></div>);\n    }    \n});\n```\n\nIt wasn't quite as obvious as that in real life, but ultimately that's what it boiled down to. It caused the whole page to freeze until the browser killed it. But the warning / error that React gave me was no help at all in trying to diagnose the issue:\n\n> \"React attempted to use reuse markup in a container but the checksum was invalid. This generally means that you are using server rendering and the markup generated on the server was not what the client was expecting. React injectednew markup to compensate which works but you have lost many of  the benefits of server rendering. Instead, figure out why the markup being generated is different on the client or server.\"\n",
