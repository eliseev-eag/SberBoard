  "body": "From your meeting notes:\n\n> There are tons of different ways to render JS styles (see Radium, CSS Modules, React Native Web, etc)\n\nI see tremendous opportunity here for powerful third-party stylesheet packages. And without burying the lead too much: \n\n**What if React DOM didn't manage inline styles at all?** An external inline-style library would be responsible for producing a valid `toString()` response to send into the `style` prop of the renderer. Maybe if the renderer was expecting an object form, you could also create an expectation around `valueOf()` returning a primitive object.\n\nThis could look something like:\n\n``` javascript\nimport React from 'react'\nimport Stylesheet from 'my-stylesheet-library'\n\nvar stylesheet = Stylesheet.create({\n  color: 'blue',\n  fontSize: 12\n})\n\nconsole.log(stylesheet.toString()) // => \"color: blue; fontSize: 12px;\"\n\nexport default function () {\n  // Here, ReactDOM will call `toString()` on stylesheet to produce a valid style\n  // attribute. All invariants, warnings, and errors associated with the stylesheet \n  // are handled by the library.\n  return (\n    <div style={ stylesheet }>\n      Externally managed inline styles FTW!\n   </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nReact could provide an add-on that maintains the existing functionality to get things started - similarly with how you all have shifted `immutability-helpers` off to the community. However it puts React in a place where:\n1. Inline stylesheet package maintainers have greater control. \n2. Static inline styles can be compiled ahead of time.\n3. React does not have to spend dev effort on maintaining inline style support\n4. Those not heavily using inline styles can use template strings and benefit from a lighter weight React (though this isn't really a huge deal)\n",
