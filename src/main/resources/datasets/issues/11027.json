  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen adding event handlers, it is common practice to do something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst MyButton = ({ canClick, onClick }) =>\r\n  <div onClick={canClick && onClick}></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was fine in React 15.x, but in 16 it reports a warning, which is technically correct:\r\n\r\n> Expected `onClick` listener to be a function, instead got a value of `boolean` type.\r\n\r\nHowever, this now forces you to use the more verbose variant:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst MyButton = ({ canClick, onClick }) =>\r\n  <div onClick={(canClick && onClick) ? onClick : undefined}></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI think it makes sense to allow `null`, `false`, and `undefined` in addition to function types for event handlers. Or just anything \"falsy\", although that may be too much to ask.\r\n\r\nI definitely understand the rationale from a type safety perspective, but this does make it less pragmatic. I am personally a huge fan of how JS evaluates `null`, `0`, `\"\"` and `undefined` to `false`, and it reduces the amount of boilerplate needed to conditionally wire up handlers.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16, all browsers. This did not emit a warning in React 15 and below.\r\n",
