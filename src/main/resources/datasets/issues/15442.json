Not massive mind, but for every one of these you always open with ``{` `` and always close with `` `}``.  I don't know if those will render correctly, it's hard to type a literal backtick in markdown, so just in case `brace-backtick` and `backtick-brace`.  Backticks are not valid in HTML or JSX, so it would be a very small QOL improvement if they could be used directly to specify attributes.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nreturn (\r\n\t<MyComponent className=`${classA} ${classB}` />\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would be quite a special case of raw string literals.  You couldn't use tags, such as:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nreturn (\r\n\t<MyComponent className=tag`${classA} ${classB}` />\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout going back to the normal method:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nreturn (\r\n\t<MyComponent className={tag`${classA} ${classB}`} />\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd backticks anywhere but immediately starting an attribute would just be interpreted the same as now - as a literal character:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nreturn (\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\tThis is a backtick: `\r\n\t</div>\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16 at least.\r\n\r\n",
