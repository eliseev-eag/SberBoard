After chatting with @sophiebits we decided it would be clearer if we just used `invariant` in both places.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\n* Less forks to maintain.\r\n* We have error codes in www (same as https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12539).\r\n* If the error code URL for some reason contains `%s`, on www we'll no longer attempt to replace it (that was a potential bug in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12539).\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n* Slightly larger bundles. (A few dozen bytes.)\r\n* In www's `invariant` implementation, `framesToProp` might need to account for React errors specifically (and be `2`). Or maybe it doesn't matter since we get the exact message through the decoder anyway.\r\n",
