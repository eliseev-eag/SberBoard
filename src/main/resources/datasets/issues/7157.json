  "body": "I don't think this is the expected behavior, so I'll be reporting this as a bug.\n\nI'm creating a data table component for one of my projects, and in this component I decided to implement extensions to the table as different types of columns, but when I was creating a 'CheckableTableColumn' to extend the regular column to support 'toggle' actions (just putting a checkbox inside it) I ran into this strange behavior where when I try to attach a onChange handler to the checkbox from an upper-in-the-tree component, the event was firing twice. \n\nLooking into it, I found out that the onChange event in the checkbox (that React translates to a onclick event) was bubbling up to the td component that contains the checkbox (which for simplicity was just spreading the passed props to it).\n\nI managed to reproduce this behavior in the following bin: http://jsbin.com/fakasoqino/edit?js,console,output (to reproduce it, just click on one of the checkboxes on in the table)\n\nI do not know why the td element is attaching the onChange handler, but I think it should not do it, should it?\n\nI've had the same problem in the latest stable chrome, firefox and opera. \n\nThe React version that I'm currently using is the latest one (v15.1.0).\n\nThank you all in advance.\n",
