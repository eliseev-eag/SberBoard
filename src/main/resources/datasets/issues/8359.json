  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nA bug üêõ \r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe ref callback gets called with `null` as argument instead of an instance of the component. This **only** occurs when you write the component name starting with an uppercase character (PascalCase). If you write the component starting with a lowercase character (camelCase) everything works as expected.\r\n\r\nThis jsfiddle demonstrates how you get a `null` argument: https://jsfiddle.net/1v9vk4zb/\r\nAnd this demonstrates how you get a correct reference: https://jsfiddle.net/a0d0owru/\r\n\r\nAs you can see I just renamed `Button` to `lowercaseButton`.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIt should **always** pass the component instance as argument to the callback.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThis occurs in `v15.4.0` and `v15.3.1`. I didn't tested any other versions.",
