  "body": "This is to support edge cases, specifically with `create-react-class`, where a mixin defines a legacy lifecycle but the component being created defines an UNSAFE_ one (or vice versa).\r\n\r\nI did not warn about this case because the warning would be a bit redundant with the deprecation warning which we will soon be enabling. I could be convinced to change my stance here though.\r\n\r\nAdded some new tests for this on the various renders that it impacts (default, ssr, shallow). Also verified that this change fixes several (all that I've tested so far) of the test that failed internally for me on www after running the rename codemod.",
