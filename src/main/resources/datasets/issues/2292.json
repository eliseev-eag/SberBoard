  "body": "Hi,\n\nThis is probably by design but I wanted to make sure.\n\nI had a problem with using `CSSTransitionGroup` together with RAF batching strategy. I'm aware that RAF batching is not officially supported but it works very well for me and solves quite a few problems in my app so I don't want to give it up.\n\nThe problem is following: `CSSTransitionGroup` [removes](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/addons/transitions/ReactCSSTransitionGroupChild.js#L67) `-leave` and `-leave-active` classes just before calling `finishCallback()`. Is it really necessary to do so?\n\nWith batching strategy other than default, this may (and does with RAF) result in `-leave` and `-leave-active` classes being removed _a tick before_ element is removed from the DOM. Thus the element flickers.\n\nIf I move these calls behind a condition, transition group behaves just fine:\n\n``` javascript\nif (animationType !== 'leave') {\n  CSSCore.removeClass(node, className);\n  CSSCore.removeClass(node, activeClassName);\n}\n```\n\nAm I missing something?\n\n**Edit:** Indeed, I am missing the situation where I fire another `enter` before `leave` completesâ€”probably in this case my `if` won't work. But still I wish there was a way around this.\n",
