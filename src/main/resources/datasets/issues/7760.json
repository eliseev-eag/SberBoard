  "body": "On occasion it would be cleaner to have a stateless functional component render a plain String (or perhaps any type that satisfies `React.PropTypes.node`) without needing to wrap it in an element. I can imagine this lending itself well to leaf components; I'm less sure that it would be possible to solve for plain nodes at the root, though.\n\n(Sorry if this has been discussed before, I couldn't find any existing issues that looked related.)\n",
