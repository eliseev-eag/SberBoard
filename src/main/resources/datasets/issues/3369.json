  "body": "As per @syranide's comments in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/3317, shallowEqual still has a couple of issues.  For instance, `shallowEqual(1, 2) === true` and `shallowEqual(1,{}) === true`.  As per @spicyj we can probably short-circuit if _either input is not of type object AND the values are not equal_.\n",
