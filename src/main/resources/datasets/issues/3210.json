  "body": "The way we implement portals is through a nested React.render in componentDidMount/Update. This is also how react-art can switch render mode in the middle of the tree.\n\nThis comes with a few problems.\n\n1) We can't reason about the depth of a component. Which is why we had to implement mountOrder.\n2) We can't reason about its position in the tree for debugging purposes (react-devtools).\n3) We can't pass the context through to the next subtree.\n\nWe should have a first-class concept of nested render trees, that can optionally use a different render mode.\n",
