  "body": "When React schedules a rendering task, it passes a `timeout` option based on its expiration time. This is intended to avoid starvation by other React updates. However, it also affects the relative priority of React tasks and other Scheduler tasks at the same level, like data processing.\r\n\r\nThis adds a feature flag to disable passing a `timeout` option to Scheduler. React tasks will always append themselves to the end of the queue, without jumping ahead of already scheduled tasks.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect the order in which React updates within a single root are processed, but it could affect updates across multiple roots.\r\n\r\nThis also doesn't remove the expiration from Scheduler. It only means that React tasks are not given special treatment.",
