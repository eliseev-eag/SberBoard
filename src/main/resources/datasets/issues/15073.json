  "body": "useReducer's `dispatch()` function is not processing the action triggered by some of my components. I imported `useReducer` locally inside of each of my 3 components. The `dispatch()` inside the parent component is working but not in 2 child components. I tried to make the parent component the only source of `dispatch()` and pass it to the 2 child components as a prop (`props.dispatch`) but it didn't work as well.",
