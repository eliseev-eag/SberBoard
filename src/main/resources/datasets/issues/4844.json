  "body": "I've noticed this while cleaning up older code in one of my components - I have \"cleaning\" that needs to happen before it loads. Originally placed it within getInitialState which works fine, but really doesn't feel like the right place to put it in.\n\ncomponentWillMount sounds like the better alternative, but it seems as thought it's called later in the lifecycle (and in fact there's no hook before getInitialState).\n\nI realise this might be a bit of an edge case, but it feels like these two hooks should either be re-ordered or a different hook added?\n",
