  "body": "\r\nCould you please add a clarification to the [License FAQ](https://code.facebook.com/pages/850928938376556) which describes the rights and obligations concerning the patent grant when redistributing ReactJS?\r\n\r\nE.g. something like this:\r\n\"If I redistribute ReactJS to a third party in any form (e.g. fork and modify it, or incorporate it in my product). Is it allowed to choose only the BSD License as my license and drop the additional patent grant?\"\r\n\r\n--> My guess: yes!\r\n\r\n\"If I redistribute ReactJS to a third party in any form (e.g. fork and modify it, or incorporate it in my product). Is it possible to also transfer the additional patent grant to my receivers of the derived work?\"\r\n\r\n--> My guess: No. The patent grant is only a license between facebook and their direct receivers. Formally you have to delete the patent grant and the third party has to receive this license from the react upstream project.\r\n\r\n\"Is the Facebook license compatible with the GPLv2?\"\r\n\r\n--> My guess: Yes it is. Since the BSD-3-Clause is and the patents grant is only an addition.\r\n\r\n",
