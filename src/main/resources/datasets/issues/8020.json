  "body": "Resolves https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6731\n\nIn IE11, setting the `node.placeholder` will also set `node.textContent`, so when we ended up setting `textContent` to `\"\"` via `DOMLazyTree.queueText` in in `_createInitialChildren` , it caused the placeholder to never show up.\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/commit/18d418aa05acd2f3f895014e1652914a4c8cc651 resolves this by checking if the `<textarea/>` has a `placeholder` and `text` is empty. If it is, it skips `queueText`.\n\nWe were also unconditionally setting `node.value = node.textContent`, which before https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/18d418aa05acd2f3f895014e1652914a4c8cc651 just meant we'd set it to an empty string, but now we're setting `node.value` equal to the placeholder in IE11.\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/commit/07998a5e5c634f3b25ad21fff6d0b7a34856360f resolves this by only setting `node.value` if `textContent` is our expected `initialValue`.\n#### Test plan\n\nTested with [this component](https://gist.github.com/Aweary/7797aa519c2190c8c5b820200012de37), which contains uncontrolled/controlled `<textarea/>`s with and without `defaultValue`/`placeholder`\n\nTested in the following browsers: \n- IE10\n- IE11\n- Firefox 49\n- Chrome 53\n- Safari 9\n- Safari 10\n- iOS 9 (Safari)\n- iOS 8 (Safari)\n\ncc @spicyj @sebmarkbage\n",
