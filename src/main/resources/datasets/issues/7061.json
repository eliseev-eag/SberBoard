  "body": "In react, if you dont have initial state via getInitialState(), we usually have this.state to be null.\n\nthis.setState() can receive function with the following signature:\n\nfunction(prevState) {\n}\n\nOn initial call it seems that React is initializing this to an empty Object (prevState) even though that is indeed still empty thus subsequent access to the state after setState returns now returns an empty object.\n\nIs this an intended behavior?\n\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/1uqf2gnc/\n",
