  "body": "Support question here - I am looking for a robust and performant way to update an input field's text programmatically, _where the input field has `defaultValue` instead of `value`_.\r\n\r\nSomething like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrender: function(){\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n\r\n      <input\r\n        id=\"pickupField\"\r\n        tabIndex=\"1\"\r\n        placeholder=\"\"\r\n        className=\"order-form-input\"\r\n        onFocus={this.disableAddresses}\r\n        onBlur={() => {\r\n            this.enableAddresses();\r\n            this.fieldChange('address');\r\n        }}\r\n        // we use defaultValue, not value\r\n        defaultValue={(order.pickup || {}).address || ''}  \r\n        ref=\"pickupAddress\"\r\n        hintText={(this.state.hideHintText) ? \"\" : \"Enter the pickup address\"}\r\n        floatingLabelFixed={true}\r\n        floatingLabelText=\"Pickup Address\"\r\n      />\r\n   )\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem I am having is that I want to sync with the database, upon the \"onBlur\" event of the input field. If I use `value` instead of `defaultValue`, _I can get this to work_, but there are two problems I see with using value instead of defaultvalue:\r\n\r\n(a) much less performant => updating the react component state on every keystroke\r\n(b) more importantly, it makes my database sync logic more complex, because I will update the React component state on every keystroke, but only sync with the database on every onBlur. I'd rather not have to write that logic, if possible.\r\n\r\nI asked this question on SO:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/41133182/react-uncontrolled-component-updating-the-input-fields-despite-presence-of-def\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any ideas, thanks!",
