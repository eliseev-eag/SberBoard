  "body": "This comes from my discussion with several people around animation, but I feel like it's important enough to warrant its own issue.\n\nWe already insist that `render` should be a pure function of `this.props` and `this.state`. How about taking this further and pass those in CompositeComponent? This way we can write:\n\n``` html\nrender: function(props, state) {\n  return <div>{props.something}</div>;\n}\n```\n\nWhile most of the time we'll still call `render(this.props, this.state)` internally, with this we will be able to do `render(somePrevProps, someTestState)` from React or even from the user. Being able to \"test the water\" would be very valuable in the future. For example:\n\n``` js\ncomponentWillReceiveProps: function(nextProps) {\n  var result1 = this.render(this.props, this.state);\n  var result2 = this.render(nextProps, this.state);\n  // Collection of changed stuff. Good for preparing mounting/unmounting animations or such logic.\n  React.reconciler.getDiff(result1, result2);\n  this.setState({...});\n}\n```\n\nI've heard this can also solve some problems with pendingState? Not too familiar with the issue.\n@jordwalke @sebmarkbage @petehunt \n",
