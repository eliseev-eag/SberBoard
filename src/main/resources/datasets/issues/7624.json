  "body": "The bug i'm experiencing is that ref callbacks are not called after mount when using renderToString.\n\nFrom the documentation: \n\n> React supports a special attribute that you can attach to any component. The ref attribute can be a callback function, and this callback will be executed immediately after the component is mounted. The referenced component will be passed in as a parameter, and the callback function may use the component immediately, or save the reference for future use (or both).\n\nMy expectations are that the ref callbacks would be called after mount for both client side rendering, and server side rendering (using `renderToString`).\n",
