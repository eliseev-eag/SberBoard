  "body": "In the current implementation, `pendingProps` is null if there are no new props since the last commit. When that happens, we bail out and reuse the current props.\r\n\r\nBut it makes more sense to always set `pendingProps` to whatever the next props will be. In other words, `pendingProps` is never null on the work-in-progress: it points to either new props, or to the current props. Modeling it this way lets us delete lots of code branches and is easier to reason about bail outs: just compare the pending props to the current props.",
