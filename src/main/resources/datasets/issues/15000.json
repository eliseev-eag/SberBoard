Something like the following would work I guess:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst React = require('react')\r\nconst {act} = require('react-dom/test-utils')\r\n\r\nconst wrap = fn => (...args) => {\r\n  let result\r\n  act(() => {\r\n    result = fn(...args)\r\n  })\r\n  return result\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst useState = React.useState\r\nconst useReducer = React.useReducer\r\n\r\nReact.useState = (...params) => {\r\n  const result = useState(...params)\r\n  result[1] = wrap(result[1])\r\n  return result\r\n}\r\n\r\nReact.useReducer = (...params) => {\r\n  const result = useReducer(...params)\r\n  result[1] = wrap(result[1])\r\n  return result\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI made a [small library](https://github.com/webNeat/react-act) offering this after a [story of issues with testing hooks](https://github.com/webNeat/react-act/blob/master/story.md) and it would be awesome if this was part of React DOM itself.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.8+ and React DOM 16.8+\r\n",
