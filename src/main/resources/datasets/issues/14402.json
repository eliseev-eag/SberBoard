I love this feature which is very handy for developing.\r\n\r\nI know that developer should not depend on only client side validation and should validate any credentials both client and server. \r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n I thought how about disabling `react-devtools` to tack component tree and editing components if user does not wants any changes in production. Maybe to pass some flag?\r\n\r\nSorry if it is silly issue ðŸ™ˆ",
