  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nReport a bug.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nExpected behavior is that `$ browserify index.js` and the [recommended optimization](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#browserify) `$ browserify index.js -p bundle-collapser/plugin` resolve requires correctly and produce functionally equivalent output.\r\n\r\n### What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nObserved behavior is that [bundle-collapser](https://github.com/substack/bundle-collapser) causes a browserified bundle to resolve files incorrectly when components with different paths have identical contents.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nFor a full reproduction, see: [bundle-collapser-uniqueness-failure#react](https://github.com/rreusser/bundle-collapser-uniqueness-failure/tree/react). `a/index.js` and `b/index.js` should render different values (coming from `a/value.js` and `b/value.js`, respectively), but since the component content is identical, `b/index.js` erroneously resolves to the wrong component and displays a's value.\r\n\r\nFor a simpler reproduction not specific to react, see [bundle-collapser-uniqueness-failure](https://github.com/rreusser/bundle-collapser-uniqueness-failure).\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThis is a browserify+bundle-collapser issue so that the react version is irrelevant. The real issue here is that it's an [officially recommended optimization](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#browserify) that may result in an invalid bundle.",
