  "body": "Hi React Team!\n\nRight now the following code fails:\n\n```\nvar spec = Object.create(null);\nspec.render = function () {\n  return <div />;\n};\nReact.createClass(spec);\n```\n\nIt fails because the function `mixSpecIntoComponent` called from `React.createClass` references `spec.hasOwnProperty`. But `spec` was created from `Object.create(null)`, so it doesn't have regular prototype methods like `hasOwnProperty`.\n\nHere's a [patch](https://github.com/ryankaplan/react/commit/547af13f1fdc4772f9573e8ec19994691240f8c3) that fixes the issue. Let me know, based on my explanation below, if you agree that this is worth fixing and I can submit a PR.\n\n---\n\nMotivation for fixing this: I'm experimenting with building React bindings for a language called [Skew](http://skew-lang.org/). Skew compiles to Javascript (among other languages) and the map-type in Skew compiles to instances of `Object.create(null)`. That is: the Skew code `var map = { \"hi\": \"there\" }` translates roughly to `var map = Object.create(null); map[\"hi\"] = \"there\";`. This is sensible - there's no need for a map to inherit from `Object.prototype`.\n\nIn Skew I'd like to be able to do something like...\n\n```\nReact.createClass({\n    \"render\": () React.Element => {\n        return SkewReact.createElement(\"div\");\n    } \n})\n```\n\nWhere `React.createClass` is the regular `createClass` function defined in the React library. But this fails because it passes a Skew map (which is `Object.create(null)` in Javascript)  to `createClass`. Instead I have to do something like:\n\n```\nSkewReact.createClass({\n    ...\n})\n```\n\nWhere `SkewReact` will wrap the input into something that inherits `Object` before passing that on to the real `React.createClass`. This works, but means that my API won't mirror that of React directly which means it'll be harder for people to learn.\n",
