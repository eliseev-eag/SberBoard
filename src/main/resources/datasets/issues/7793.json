  "body": "For `LinkedInput` to be actually useful as a replacement for `valueLink`/`checkedLink` on regular `input` elements, it needs to trigger `requestChange` of the `ReactLink` object. This can be achieved by this one-line change.\n\nI wanted to add a corresponding test, but for tests to work for me locally, I had to revert parts of #7168, which I assume is going in a wrong direction.\n\nA couple of additional notes on the tests:\n- Currently, they're not captured by `grunt test` as both the folder name is wrong and the `packages` folder is not in `testPathDirs` of `package.json`\n- When fixing the previous issue, and getting jest to find this package's tests, they fail on require statements. I had an idea on how to fix this, but it looked to me as if it would break npm packaging of `react-linked-input` and since I couldn't find instructions on how to build that package, I gave up on fixing the tests.\n",
