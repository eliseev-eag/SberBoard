  "body": "Hello, \r\n\r\nI am working with React project, which is working properly for chrome both on QA and UAT environment. It is working for IE 11 + window 10.  But for IE 11 + window 7, it is fine on UAT environment, have problem on QA, it displays blank page.  \r\nF12 has the following information: \r\n1.  console does not display any error message, except warning of \"DOM7011: The code on this page disabled back and forward caching. For more information, see: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=291337\"\r\n2.   Network tab display 2 transaction, first one is \"https://xxx.auth-dev.atb.com/login/callback\" and second one is \"http://xxx-qa.us-east.containers.mybluemix.net/callback#access_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJ...\"\r\n3.  In Debugger tab, it display message \"Failed to open https://xxx.auth-dev.atb.com/login/callback'. \r\n\r\nAfter click refresh tab, url 2 return to url 1, which is \"https://xxx.auth-dev.atb.com/login/callback\"\r\nthen click back button, expected page is displayed.  \r\n\r\nI did some debug and found after click login page,   our \"backup\" route is not called.  \r\n\r\nOur React version is 16.3.1\r\nI read some post from your website, which said React 16 and IE 11 has some Inconsistency, I am not sure if this error is cause by that Inconsistency  or not. \r\n\r\nHas any advice ?  If need more information, please let me know. \r\n\r\nThank you. \r\nTom\r\n\r\n",
