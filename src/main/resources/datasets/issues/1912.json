  "body": "PR for #996\n\nI choose to believe that users should be correcting their own \"mistakes\", rather than have React transparently fix and unknowingly introduce weird edge-cases and visual artifacts.\n\nQuite simply, this PR enforces that there are no other nodes except the node rendered by React inside the target, it obviously does not warn if there isn't a node rendered by React inside the target. It only performs this check in DEV.\n\nThere is another test in #1903 which complements this PR.\n",
