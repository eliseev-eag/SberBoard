I haven't been able to track down the commit/branch where that is happening, so I can't provide more specific advice on how to catch errors in components (although there [will be a way to do that][2]).\n\nSpun off from #9037.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6895#issuecomment-281405036\n[2]: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9037#issuecomment-281558149",
