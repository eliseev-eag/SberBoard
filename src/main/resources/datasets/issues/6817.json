  "body": "I spent several hours trying to understand how to attach a React animation event to a React DOM element. Since I am used to doing it the regular javascript way (via `node.addEventListener(...etc)`) I eventually managed the mental gymnastics of realizing \"... wait... maybe its just like `onClick`\"\n\nWhich it was! And it looks quite beautiful. But it did take me a couple of hours. \n\nI now realize how obvious this is, but it was a very frustrating couple of hours. Since I don't think I am the only person who is going to be confused by this, I have added a small blurb about how to attach these events to React DOM elements. Please let me know if I can write this better somehow, or if the examples are lacking.. Thanks!\n",
