  "body": "`ReactTestRenderer.act()` only works for `react-test-renderer`.\r\n`ReactTestUtils.act()` only works for `react-dom`.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately due to poor naming, people confuse those two things.\r\n\r\nWe need to:\r\n\r\n* Make sure `ReactTestRenderer.act()` around `react-dom` updates doesn't silence the warning, and vice versa. (Currently, it does â€” but you can fix it by using an empty object that's unique per renderer instead of a `true` value.)\r\n\r\n* Add a special warning message when a different renderer is \"acting\" updates. That warning message should suggest that you're supposed to use `act()` corresponding to the renderer you're using, e.g. `react-dom/test-utils` for `react-dom`.\r\n\r\nThis should fix most cases where people wrap updates in the wrong `act`.",
