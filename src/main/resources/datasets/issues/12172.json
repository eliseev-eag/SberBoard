  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nA bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen assigning the onChange listener on a radio button group (or its form) the event only fires once per radio button \r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nI created a basic example of the problem (which is working in jsfiddle since I guess its using the most up to date version of react)\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/6vco4t1h/1/\r\nI also found a workaround for the problem by using a components internal state detailed here:\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/6vco4t1h/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe onChange event should fire every time the selected radio button changes\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nAffected version is 15.6.2 and as far as I can tell it happens across all browsers. I did not check previous but future versions and in 16.x this problem appears to be fixed (sadly we are still in in the process of preparing for the update to 16.x).\r\n",
