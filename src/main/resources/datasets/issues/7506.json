  "body": "This appears to be a bug in React with the Microsoft Edge browser. This was previously a bug in older Internet Explorer browsers as well, but appears to have been fixed by #6982 – unfortunately the fix did not resolve the issue in Edge.\n\nI modified the codepen from the original issue to use React 15.3.0, which includes the above-referenced pull request, and demonstrates the bug in Edge: \nhttp://codepen.io/anon/pen/QEYoLV\n\nHere is the output of that Codepen in IE 11 – this is the expected behavior as `innerHTML` is not available in Internet Explorer, yet React 15.3 is still able to function:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/123403/17674467/41cad16e-62eb-11e6-9813-72ba8170d3c5.png)\n\nAnd here is the output of the same Codepen in Edge 38:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/123403/17674514/6fb10a3a-62eb-11e6-9c2b-6528be67e48c.png)\n\nThe problem seems to be that Edge has `innerHTML`, so it does not use the IE workaround code, yet Edge does not appear to be refreshing the DOM after updating – at least I can see the SVG contents added to the DOM using Inspect Element, but they are not visible in the browser.\n",
