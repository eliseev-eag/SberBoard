  "body": "Although contextTypes are only recently document in react and the api is still unstable I find it odd that these two similar annotations (that accept the same react prop validations) don't work the same way.\n\nWith propTypes, if you omit a propType you still receive the property, propTypes simply validate properties. However with contextTypes this is not the case, you only receive the context if you set a validation for the contextType.\n\nI would assume (if I were new to both features) that I would be given context automatically if there is any passed to my component (similar to props). However I am forced to explicitly state which context my component can receive.\n\nWhat benefit does this have? I certainly understand the need to validate contexts, but If validation isn't needed then whats the point of having to explicitly request the context in such an unintuitive way?\n\n``` javascript\nReact.createElement({\n    contextTypes: {\n        app_context: React.propTypes.any // This wouldn't be needed with proptypes.\n    },\n    render: ...\n});\n```\n",
