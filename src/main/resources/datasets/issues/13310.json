  "body": "This is a curious bug: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13188.\r\n\r\nOn 16.4.1, this test fails with\r\n\r\n```\r\nInvariant Violation: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component repeatedly calls setState inside componentWillUpdate or componentDidUpdate. React limits the number of nested updates to prevent infinite loops.\r\n```\r\n\r\non the final update (which should have been gracefully rendered).\r\n\r\nOn master, this test fails by **ignoring the last update** and not rendering anything.\r\n\r\nThis test has a combination of interesting circumstances:\r\n\r\n* jsdom loaded after React\r\n* overriden `console.error` that throws\r\n\r\nwhich might contribute to why the bug occurs. We should fix it regardless though.",
