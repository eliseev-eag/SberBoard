  "body": "Please forgive me if this appears more like a rant than a feature request, but I have searched and can't find any explanation for why some error messages are displayed without any `displayName` from the component responsible - and this is driving me insane.\n\n_Every_ component in my project has an explicit `displayName` specified.  I do this for debugging.\n\nI am rendering a bunch of immutable props.  I changed one of the prop types from a `List` to a `Map` and I see:\n\n> Warning: Using Maps as children is not yet fully supported. It is an experimental feature that might be removed. Convert it to a sequence / iterable of keyed ReactElements instead.\n\nObviously I missed something, which could be easily fixed if I knew _where_ it was - even just the component's name.\n\nThis message is not only frustrating, but it's taunting \"I know where the problem is but I won't tell you!\"-feel makes it infuriating.  Looking at the stacktrace behind it is useless as well because it's, as usual, a never-ending list of React function calls with no mention of any of my source files.\n\nI have spent countless time hunting down errors like this that would have taken only moments if I knew the name of the component responsible.  It would be _infinitely more helpful_ if the `displayName` field appeared in more debug output.\n",
