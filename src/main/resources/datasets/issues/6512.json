  "body": "I am using react0.14.7 and webpack for my project. It works perfectly fine.\n\nHowever, when I try to upgrade to react15, I pops up such an error: \n\n```\naddComponentAsRefTo(...): Only a ReactOwner can have refs. You might be adding a ref to a component that was not created inside a component\\'s render method, or you have multiple copies of React loaded.\n```\n\nThis is a very classic issue (https://gist.github.com/jimfb/4faa6cbfb1ef476bd105).\n\nWhy it works in react0.14.7 but fails for react15?\n\nCould any one answer?\n",
