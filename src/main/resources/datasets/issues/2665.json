  "body": "Hi,\n\nWe've stumbled across this code block that causes exceptions to be hidden:\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/core/ReactCompositeComponent.js#L838\n\nIs there a good reason to catch all exceptions in the block and tidy it up with the finally without re-throwing the exception? This is generally considered fairly bad practice without a good reason and certainly has made debugging applications more difficult for us.\n\nIf there is a valid reason it would at least be a good idea to have a debug mode that would re-throw the exception should there be a problem here.\n\nWe're happy to supply a pull request if there was some direction as to what the correct approach here should be.\n\nThanks\n",
