  "body": "I think linkState should accept the second argument - callback for passing to setState.\n\nConsider [this example](http://jsfiddle.net/89ov1for/). I have a widget that includes a couple of inputs. Whenever any of inputs changes the widget calls this.props.onChange based on values of the inputs. Currently I have to implement my own mixin that passes down callback to setState. \n\nI think it would be reasonable if arguments for linkState were consistent with setState.\n",
