  "body": "One tricky thing I experienced recently is that onChange from input propagates (if I don't set stopPropagate), which means that if I have input somewhere deep..  any change on it will propagate through dom tree.  And since I was using onChange on some more generic components it was triggering also these..   and took while to find out why..\n\nNow I understand whats going on there. And my question is - is that intentional? And maybe would make sense to have some warning because in 99% you just want to handle input onChange and not propagate the event.\n\nAnd curious what you would consider as better practice - avoid use of onChange prop on non-form components or just use stopPropagation?\n\nThanks for your thoughts.\n",
