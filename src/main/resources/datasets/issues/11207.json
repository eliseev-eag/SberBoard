  "body": "We had an internal issue (T22633912) which manifested itself as an infinite nested update loop triggering our invariant.\r\n\r\n@trueadm investigated that it was introduced in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10426 and then fixed in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11187. We donâ€™t, however, have any failing tests related to that.\r\n\r\nEven though we removed that coalescing implementation, I feel like we need to investigate what happened and add a regression test to prevent the same issue from occurring in the future.\r\n\r\nIt might also be valuable to think about any additional information we can surface in the error, at least in development. For example, component names for last ten fibers that scheduled an update.",
