  "body": "I came accross an issue with the ReactCSSTransitionGroup component, where the `*-leave` and `*-leave-active` classes were removed **before** the component was removed from the dom.\n\nIn my situation this caused a flicker (due to styles being briefly changed before the element itself was removed). So I was wondering is this behaviour on purpose, or should the leave classes be kept on all the way through to dom removal, never removing them?\n",
