  "body": "Hi,\ncustomer has reported some bugs with react and we found problem but we dont know why it happened. Must say, these bugs was appear only on some pc. We had to go into customers office and try it on their machines. On ours machines all work fine.\n\nFollowing code in react.js \n\n```\n      isInputEventSupported = isEventSupported('input') && (\n                  (!('documentMode' in document) || document.documentMode > 9)\n      );\n```\n\nset isInputEventSupported variable to FALSE in Chrome and Firefox.\n\nWe had to fix it temporarily here\n\n```\n            if (isInputEventSupported || 1)\n                getTargetIDFunc = getTargetIDForInputEvent;\n            } else {\n                getTargetIDFunc = getTargetIDForInputEventIE;\n                handleEventFunc = handleEventsForInputEventIE;\n            }\n```\n\nthen all work allright.\n\nBut we really dont know why in newest Chrome (v. 45.0.2454.85) is performed code for old IE.\n\n Can be something wrong with the condition above depending on new Chrome/FF?\n",
