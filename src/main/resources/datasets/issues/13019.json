I'm using two stacks in practice: one stack for the \"context\" objects and one for the \"values\" we need to restore them to on the way up.\r\n\r\nI also have a DEV-only stack for providers. I could've used it for context objects too, but I decided it's nice to avoid some property access on every pop when we need to read the context object. So I only use the provider stack for push/pop mismatch validation, just like we do in Fiber.\r\n\r\n",
