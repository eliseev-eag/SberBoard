If I move `ErrorBoundary` to be above `Router` then it's fine.  Why does it behave this way?\r\n\r\nApp doesn't re-render until force refresh\r\n```\r\n<Router>\r\n    <div className=\"app-shell\">\r\n        <ErrorBoundary>\r\n            <Navbar />\r\n            <div className=\"app-main\">\r\n                <Sidebar project={this.props.currentProject} />\r\n                <MainContentRouter />\r\n            </div>\r\n            <ToastContainer />\r\n        </ErrorBoundary>\r\n    </div>\r\n<Router>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWORKS FINE\r\n```\r\n<ErrorBoundary>\r\n    <Router>\r\n        <div className=\"app-shell\">\r\n            <Navbar />\r\n            <div className=\"app-main\">\r\n                <Sidebar project={this.props.currentProject} />\r\n                <MainContentRouter />\r\n            </div>\r\n            <ToastContainer />\r\n        </div>\r\n    <Router>\r\n</ErrorBoundary>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact: 16.7.6\r\nOS: Mac",
