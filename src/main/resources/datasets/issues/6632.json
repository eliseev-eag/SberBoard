  "body": "#6046 is a rewrite of ReactPerf that aims to provide the existing features of ReactPerf in a more testable and future-proof way. However there are a few things that are out of scope of #6046 but are important to fix later after it is shipped.\n\nToday, `printOperations()` prints informations about the DOM “native” events that supposedly happened. Later, this information is used by `printWasted()` in the following way: if a component was rendered but no DOM events on its children were emitted during a batch, the render is considered wasted.\n\nThere are a few problems with this:\n- As discussed in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6612, we overemphasize the overhead of DOM operations which are actually often negligible. \n- With incremental reconciliation (#6170), the assumption that DOM operations happen in the same batch as rendering might become incorrect.\n- We might want to get rid of relying on batches at all: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6046#discussion_r61482538.\n\nI don’t know what would be a good solution considering these constraints. People widely consider `printWasted()` the most useful `ReactPerf` method because it helps finding `shouldComponentUpdate()` sweet spots. If we remove its reliance on DOM, we should offer an equivalent (e.g. deeply comparing React elements?) that is just as useful but more friendly to incremental reconciliation.\n",
