The caret \"ignores\" every other keystroke, and then jumps two places every other keystroke. Backspacing in the middle of the string also produces strange behaviour.\r\n\r\nHere is a video of the behaviour I get: \r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/XGBOCLczCy4\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThe bug is present in Chrome 55.0.2883.75 on OS X 10.11.6.\r\n\r\nThe bug is also present on a fresh install of Chrome Dev Channel 57.0.2936.0 on Windows 10 from Sauce Labs\r\n\r\nThe bug is not present in Firefox or Safari on OS X.\r\n\r\nThe bug seems to be present in both controlled and uncontrolled fields (value vs defaultValue)\r\n\r\nI'm on React 15.3.2 and react-dom 15.3.1\r\n\r\nI don't know which version Facebook Messenger is on",
