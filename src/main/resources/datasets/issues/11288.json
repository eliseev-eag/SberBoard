  "body": "A few changes as a followup to Workspaces.\r\n\r\n* Entry points now have natural names, e.g. `React`, `ReactDOM`. Just like before Fiber.\r\n* We now use npm package entry points when importing in the few places we weren't. Such as `ReactFiberReconciler` -> `react-reconciler`.\r\n* Since DOM tests often test both client and server, I removed the mostly arbitary distinction and put most of them together into `packages/dom/__tests__`.\r\n* For DOM implementation, I did another pass at checking which files are client-only/server-only/shared, and separated them into `dom/client`, `dom/server`, and `dom/shared`.\r\n* I deleted a few dead files.\r\n* I moved FB-specific `@preventMunge` directives into flat bundle itself instead of individual source files.\r\n* I separated `TestUtils` and `ReactDOMUnstableNativeDependencies` into a separate bundle type called `RENDERER_UTILS`. The main difference is it shouldn't bundle a reconciler inside itself (unlike a real renderer). This is how I uncovered https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11280 (which I fixed in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11281).\r\n\r\nThe build products look mostly the same to me except for minor dependency order changes.\r\nBundle fixture works.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1560\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-10-19 at 6 31 10 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/31785027-b835f1d6-b4fb-11e7-8e89-e3a55dc695bc.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso verified that UFI and Power Editor work in DEV and PROD.",
