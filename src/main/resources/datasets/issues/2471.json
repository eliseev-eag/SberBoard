Errors outside React components are shown normally.\n\nI tried to reproduce the problem in JSFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/pvjydrho/1/), but here the error is shown, even in Firefox.\n\nI thought it could be some issue with es5-shim, es5-sham or console-polyfill, but I tried to remove them and nothing changed.\n\nIs this a expected behavior?\n",
