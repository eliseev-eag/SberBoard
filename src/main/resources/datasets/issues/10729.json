  "body": "Bug\r\n\r\nI know deferredUpdates are unstable, so maybe this is a known problem.\r\n\r\nThis one is tricky to trigger, but when spamming `setState(function(){})` inside `unstable_deferredUpdates` a LOT you can end up with the same update happening multiple times while other calls are skipped entirely. \r\n\r\nExample code: https://gist.github.com/ryanwilliams/9cfa1bbaa43d8eae6792520a166ae1df\r\nResult: https://i.imgur.com/AOyCNFe.png\r\n\r\nIf you mouse wheel up and down real fast in the red area you see that console output. I would expect the `bar` number that's output in the console to be unique and in sequence as it's incremented every time before the closure captures it inside the new `setState()`.\r\n\r\nVersion: react-16-rc3\r\n",
