In reality the component could be something else entirely such as `<SuperUser />` which will only process and render the children if the current user is a super user, or `<Morning />` to only process and render items between 8 AM and 11 AM (or similar).  The key thing is that we do not want the props passed into the children, or the children themselves produced, unless a condition has been satisfied.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nPresumably any version of React.",
