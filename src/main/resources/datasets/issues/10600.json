I had to refer to blogposts to get a sense of the implications of using `PureComponent`s.\r\nhttps://60devs.com/pure-component-in-react.html\r\nhttps://hackernoon.com/react-purecomponent-considered-harmful-8155b5c1d4bc\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIt would really be better to have reference documentation for `PureComponent` like https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html\r\n\r\nIt should have the following\r\n\r\n- An example of `PureComponent` usage which specifically points out the functionality.\r\n- Is it possible for a `PureComponent` to override the `shouldComponentUpdate`?\r\n- A clearer explanation of how change in reference results in a re-render.\r\n- A note on how inline functions for event handlers might re-render pure components.\r\n\r\nNice to have info on \r\n\r\n- The history of `PureComponent` wrt the problem with `pure-render-mixin`\r\n- A note on how it prevents children depending on `context` info to re-render.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n`PureComponent` is a part of React v15\r\n\r\nI'm happy to work on a PR for this change if y'all think this issue is valid.",
