  "body": "It was too easy to do\r\n\r\n```js\r\ntoWarnDev(msg1, msg2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand not notice that you're actually validating just `msg1`.\r\n\r\nThis also leads to confusion when you *do* expect to get both but matcher claims you only expected one.\r\n\r\nThe correct way is:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ntoWarnDev([msg1, msg2])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds assertions that would fail the test that passes messages without an array. Also includes regression tests.\r\n\r\nIn the second commit, I fix the only five violations. They weren't surfacing any bugs â€” we were essentially ignoring assertions about the component stack because it was accidentally passed as a second argument to `toWarnDev()` instead of being concatenated. Now we check it.",
