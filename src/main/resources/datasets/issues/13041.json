  "body": "In async mode, events are interleaved with rendering. If one of those events mutates state that is later accessed during render, it can lead to inconsistencies/tearing.\r\n\r\nRestarting the render from the root is often sufficient to fix the inconsistency. We'll flush the restart synchronously to prevent yet another mutation from happening during an interleaved event.\r\n\r\nWe'll only restart during an async render. Sync renders are already sync, so there's no benefit in restarting. (Unless a mutation happens during the render phase, but we don't support that.)",
