  "body": "This adds a test for concurrent mode event dispatching.\r\n\r\nThe way we deal with discrete events (click, mouseup, mousedown, touchup, touchdown, submit, etc) is that the result from one event must fully flush before we invoke the event listener of the second one. They are always serial. Note that they're not synchronous. They won't block continuous events like rAFs, mousemoves, etc.\r\n\r\nWe implement this using the custom event system. The first thing that happens in the delegated event listener is that [we check if there are any pending discrete priority work (formerly known as \"interactive events\") and if there is, we flush it synchronously](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/c954efa70f44a44be9c33c60c57f87bea6f40a10/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberScheduler.js#L2494-L2506). Only when that is done do we search the new tree to dispatch event listeners.\r\n\r\nIf we just attached event listeners directly on the nodes, we would have no opportunity to update these before they happen.\r\n\r\n",
