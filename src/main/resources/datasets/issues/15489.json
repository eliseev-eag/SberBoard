  "body": "React beginner here. I am building this Project and everything was going fine until this. I did lot of googling for this error and I know, a lot of issues are opened here regarding the same error but i have tried EVERY one of the solutions like changing import/export default etc. (invested 2 days) and none of it fixed it for me. I recreated the error from my app into a codesandbox. I have no idea about context API but i think it might be involved in this. I also believe this could be a silly error I am missing out on.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nHere is a codesandbox:- https://codesandbox.io/s/mq9pw38kqx\r\n```\r\nInvariant Violation\r\nElement type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.\r\n\r\nCheck the render method of `Navigate`.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt loads the App.js component with Navigation menu also appearing.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact - 16.8.6\r\nChrome/Mozilla",
