  "body": "I don't know what exactly is planned, but auto bind for methods would be nice. Yeah, I know property initializers, still, a user should not have to think about that. I suppose a state should be stored in an object, not in a closure because of logs, and component should be an object ideally. Nevermind, feel free to close this \"issue\" without any explanation, I am just curious the reasoning behind a new design.",
