  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nStoring a function component as state using `useState` is interpreted as providing a lazy state function, and React then attempts to use the returned rendered result as a component.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n- Broken: https://codesandbox.io/s/0y692m078v\r\n- Fixed with workaround by wrapping it in an object literal: https://codesandbox.io/s/29ryvkr7r\r\n\r\n(Note: The context-related code is not relevant to this bug. I'm just reusing the same skeleton code for tracking down another bug that *is* context-related. But that one is probably a bug in my own code.)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nReact components - functional or otherwise - should be treated as state values rather than as lazy functions.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.7.0-alpha0. Earlier versions not applicable, since this is about hooks.",
