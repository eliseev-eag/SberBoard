  "body": "I'm trying to communicate with an iframe with the postMessage API but I have an issue with the eventListeners management in ES6\n\nIt is stated in the docs that\n\n> With React, every method is automatically bound to its component instance (except when using ES6 class syntax)\n\nThe problem is that `this.handler.bind(this) !== this.handler` so when I'm done with the event I can't remove the listener because I can't keep a reference to the handler. I could try to encapsulate the function, but the encapsulating function would also need a binding. I could try to super the constructor too but I'm not sure this is a good idea, plus I don't know the args it need. I'm quite sure I'm missing an important point here.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated !\n\n```\nexport default class SomeComponent extends Component {\n\n  handleIframeData(event) {\n    // some stuff in there that will need 'this' to be set to the component's context, to get props for example.\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.addEventListener('message', this.handleIframeData.bind(this), false)\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    // won't work because 'this.handleIframeData.bind(this) !== this.handleIframeData'\n    window.removeEventListener('message', this.handleIframeData, false)\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"SomeComponent\" style={{height: '100%', width:'100%', display: 'table'}}>\n        <iframe src=\"assets/iframe/index.html\" style={{display: 'table-row', width: '100%', height:'100%', border: 0}}></iframe>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThanks anyway !\n",
