I know this makes sense, since the behaviour of the first render has a close correlation to cDm. However, I cannot seem to find a way to fire events parent-first. Before, I could do it with cWm, and after that was deprecated, in the constructor. How can I accomplish that with hooks?\r\n**CodeSandbox example:**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/035lqnozzl?fontsize=14\r\n**What is the use case?**\r\nImagine I want to post to an external server when two components were first rendered, to measure a sort of meaningful paint.\r\n```\r\n- Component A -> post(\"first render\"\", component: A)\r\n----\r\n--------\r\n------------ Component B -> post(\"first render\", component: B)\r\n```\r\nHow could I accomplish this with hooks?",
