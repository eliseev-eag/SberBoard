You'll see the attributes are all filtered out, although they're valid as mathml.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe html is rendered with mathvariant, notation and linebreak\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nFirefox is supposed to support mathml. Websites running MathJax will also be affected.",
