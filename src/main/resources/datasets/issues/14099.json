But if it depends on props or state, it's likely it'll invalidate too often. See https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14092#issuecomment-435907249 for current workarounds.\r\n\r\n`useReducer` doesn't suffer from this because the reducer is evaluated directly in the render phase. @sebmarkbage had an idea about giving `useCallback` similar semantics but it'll likely require complex implementation work. Seems like we'd have to do _something_ like this though.\r\n\r\nI'm filing this just to acknowledge the issue exists, and to track further work on this.",
