  "body": "This appears to have been introduced in a new Chrome version, but I can't find any reference to where.\n\nAffected/Tested Browsers (OS X): \n- Chrome 51.0.2704.106 (64-bit)\n- Opera 39.0.2256.15\n\nUnaffected Browsers:\n- Safari 9.1\n- Firefox 49\n\nBackspacing in an input element with `value` or `defaultValue` set causes some very odd behavior. Once a decimal point is gone, it can't easily be re-added.\n\nExample:\n\n![react-input-bug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1197375/16786390/1d722fd4-485a-11e6-8969-780d4e4e9752.gif)\n\nIn this example, I simply backspaced twice. On the second backspace, when I expect `3.` to be showing, the input instead reads `3` and the cursor has moved to the beginning. The next two jumps are my attempts to add another decimal point.\n\nFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/kmqz6kw8/\n\nTested with React 15.2.\n\nNotes: This only occurs when `value` or `defaultValue` is set. If neither is set, the input behaves properly. We are currently working around this issue by (unfortunately) setting the input value on `componentDidMount` via a ref.\n",
