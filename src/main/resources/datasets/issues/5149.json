  "body": "Hello everybody, I'm relatively new to the project and I think I ran into an issue. I was running grunt test on a recently cloned copy of the master branch and I have been getting a failed test every once in a while while doing so without touching any part of the code. \n\nThe error is found on _it(should count no-op update as waste)_ and happens on _expect(summary[1]['Instances']).toBe(2);_ The error message is that it is expecting the instances to be 2, but it randomly returns 0's and 1's.\n",
