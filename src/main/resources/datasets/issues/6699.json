  "body": "I just ran into this issue while testing the upgrade from 0.14.8 to 15.2 in IE 10. If preventDefault() or stopPropagation() is called inside the handler for an onChange event of an input control, a \"Member not found\" exception is thrown. Stepping through the code, it appears that the the nativeObject reference is broken. Accessing most of the properties of the MSEventObj will throw the same exception.\n\nI am able to reproduce it with the minimal case below on a clean IE10 Windows7 test VM from Microsoft.\n\nRepro Fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/h6qfwa51/3/\n",
