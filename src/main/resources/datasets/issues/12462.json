Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/jjn2wnq6jy\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe HTML attributes should be lowecase.\r\n\r\nThe react-dom renderer does not suffer from this issue.\r\n\r\nThe `itemScope` microdata attribute does not suffer from this issue.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nAt least React 16.1 and 16.2 are affected, React 15.x does not appear to be.\r\n\r\nThis is not a browser related issue.",
