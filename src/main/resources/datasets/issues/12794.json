At the moment, this problem can be said in all projects of the world.\r\nThe fact is that these packages are at the kernel level. I think you need to fix and check the packages before publishing. Because it turns out that you are the core that converts packets into one single entity called React. I can not develop further...I can not study React! I like React!\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThere should not be such. Fearfully.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact latest\r\nWindows 10\r\n",
