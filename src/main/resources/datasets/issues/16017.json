  "body": "Proposed alternative to #15170\r\n\r\nSeveral people have asked, \"_Could you provide a method to access the component stack directly?_\". I think our reasoning against this was that we didn't want people to _depend_ on that stack, or to try to parse it and build anything on top of it.\r\n\r\nI don't think we considered the case of instrumenting error logging though. Facebook (and probably others) overrides `console.error` to capture the call stack and save it somewhere. A downside of `React.error` is that it would cause errors from different call sites to be grouped together (unless the instrumenting code was smart enough to skip over the React frame).\r\n\r\nOverriding only these two console methods also feels like a bit of an incomplete solution (#15726) to the logging story.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces `React.warn` and `React.error` with a method that returns the current component stack¹ which people can log to whichever console group they want.\r\n\r\n¹ At the moment, this method always returns an empty string in prod.",
