  "body": "I'm trying to use React with [otto](https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto), which is implemented in Go and\ndoes not support lookaheads or backreferences in regular expressions.\n(Unfortunately that _does_ mean that otto isn't fully compatible with\nthe ECMA5 spec; but since this is the only lookahead I am aware of in\nthe React codebase, this change makes React once again compatible with\notto, and any other JS implementation that may not be fully compliant on\nregular expressions).\n\nAs far as I can tell, the previous code replaced a sequence of slash\ncharacters with one more slash than before. The new code avoids the\nnegative lookahead by matching any sequence of slash characters and then\nusing the special `$&` placeholder to replace the matched sequence with\nthe original sequence, plus one more slash.\n",
