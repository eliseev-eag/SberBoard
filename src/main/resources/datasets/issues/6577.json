  "body": "The docs say:\n\n> The defaultValue and defaultChecked props are only used during initial render. If you need to update the value in a subsequent render, you will need to use a controlled component. (https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html#default-value)\n\nThe note in the docs say that `defaultValue` is only used during `initial` rendering. So I think it would be better to name it `initialValue` because it describes the behaviour of this property better. \n\nTranslating the terms to german a `defaultValue` means something static which can't be changed during runtime. An `initialValue` of an input element might mutate during runtime. (eg. prefill a form with the current time)\n\nI'm not an english native speaker so it might be that the english language doesn't differentiate those two terms as the german language does.\n",
