  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIf you add the 'is' attribute to a button element in JSX, along with a \"className\" attribute, the \"className\" is translated to \"classname\" instead of \"class\". this causes most css-in-js engines to fail to style the button as well as keeping CSS from styling it.\r\n\r\nFor using it within a Chromecast sender app, it breaks the behavior in that Chrome is looking for.\r\n\r\nReplication case:\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/yjjq44qxjv - courtesy of the material-ui team, who found that they can't fix it because it isn't something they triggered.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n\"className\" becomes \"class\", and any behaviors added to the button by Chromecast's v1 framework apply correctly just as if react was not involved.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nyes, I had an app that was 15.6.2 and that worked just fine.",
