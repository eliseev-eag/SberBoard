  "body": "Note: this is for an experimental event API that we're testing out internally at Facebook.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds logic to listen to events defined in event responders, following on from previous PRs:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15036\r\n- https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15112\r\n- https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15150\r\n\r\nThis PR is quite difficult to test in isolation without creating unit tests that depend on internals (which I know we're moving away from as a team). In the next PR, I'll add further logic that connects the event firing to appropriate events that make for good public API tests. There isn't much to this PR to review other than a single function where most of the work happens, so hopefully it should be transparent as to what happens.l",
