  "body": "As @vjeux noted in https://www.facebook.com/groups/2003630259862046/permalink/2102903916601346/, using node v6.5 fails some tests. This is due to the status quo where `function.name` isn't well supported. @keyanzhang point to https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/ed8a753346661ca8ecff04385f6cf4abe87167c1/src/isomorphic/classic/class/ReactClass.js#L765 which is the function name we're picking up.\n\nI changed a couple places in our code which were falling back to `function.name` to actually attempt to differentiate between cases where that's useful. It's not useful for the `React.createClass` cases since that will always be `Constructor`. Instead I check if we have a `displayName` property instead of just using truthiness which seems to be good enough to differentiate.\n\nTangential - we should probably consolidate so we don't duplicate this code. Originally it was pretty simple but we've had to add more checks and it's gotten longer. It's slightly different in these 2 places but close enough (and we can just use the same thing in both places).\n\n**Test Plan:** Run tests in both node v6.5 & 4.x. Pass consistently.\n",
