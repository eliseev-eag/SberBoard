I have a counter to count the amount of rerenders. The button also has another callback, which fires `onClick`, also calling the same `setState`. The set timeout callback causes 4 rerenders, while the onClick callback only causes a single rerender, as expected.\r\n\r\nThis is probably not specific to `setTimeout`, but this is the simplest way I found to reproduce this problem.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI expected the `setTimeout` callback to also cause a single rerender only.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16.8+",
