  "body": "Fixes https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/18868#issuecomment-413579095.\r\n\r\nThis removes a noisy false positive warning that occurs on RN whenever you call something like `measureInWindow()` on a `NativeComponent` descendant. The warning occurred because `mountSafeCallback` checks for `isMounted` (and calls if it exists), but `NativeComponent` only inherits an `isMounted` getter that warns about its deprecation from `React.Component`.\r\n\r\nIn fact `isMounted()` wasn't being called for host components as the original code probably assumed â€” because they [don't have](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/5031ebf6beddf88cac15f4d2c9e91f8dbb91d59d/packages/react-native-renderer/src/ReactNativeFiberHostComponent.js#L33-L98) a method called like this.\r\n\r\nSo the method was already lying about its usefulness. It only works on old-style `createClass()` components. Which happen to define a field called `__isMounted`. So I switched the method to check for that field alone, and reflected its true nature in its naming.\r\n\r\n**TLDR: this removes a noisy false positive warning, and leaves a TODO to fix the method because it doesn't do what it claims.**",
