  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nReport a bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen using Suspense, triggering several very-rapid non-cache hits locks up the nearest parent Suspense component until it is remounted.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce**\r\n- Visit https://codesandbox.io/s/00ml9vl9qv\r\n- Open Devtools to show the Network inspector\r\n- Click a post to view\r\n- Click the “Next” button (or focus it with your keyboard)\r\n- Press space bar multiple times very quickly (6 should do)\r\n- Inspect the network tab. You'll find that some of the later posts requests did not happen at all and that any further post requests made will also not be called.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nAll cache/resource requests should be called regardless of how quickly or how many pending requests are currently inflight.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact: 16.7.0-alpha.0\r\nBrowser: 70.0.3538.77 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\nOS: MacOS Mohave 10.14\r\n",
