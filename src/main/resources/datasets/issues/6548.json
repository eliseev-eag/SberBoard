  "body": "After upgrading to react `15.0.1` I get the following error when running `npm install`\n\n```\nnpm WARN react-addons-css-transition-group@0.14.8 requires a peer of react@^0.14.8 but none was installed.\nnpm WARN react-addons-update@0.14.8 requires a peer of react@^0.14.8 but none was installed.\n```\n\nI think it is due to these two add-ons I include:\n\n```\n\"react-addons-css-transition-group\": \"^0.14.7\",\n\"react-addons-update\": \"^0.14.7\",\n```\n\nI would intuitively upgrade them to\n\n```\n\"react-addons-css-transition-group\": \"^0.15.1\",\n\"react-addons-update\": \"^0.15.1\",\n```\n\nBut since it is a \"breaking change\" in version, I'd like to check up the changelog with each addon to ensure that I do not have any code that will break. However, I cannot find any changelog or gitrepo belonging to theese add-ons. What is the right approach here? Should we simply follow the react version number every time?\n\nThanks in advance; a bit lost here.\n",
