Either exclude it or remove the dependency array. eslint(react-hooks/exhaustive-deps)\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.

Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\neslint-plugin-react-hooks 1.6.0\r\n\r\n**Workaround**\r\n\r\nA workaround for this situation is:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction MyComponent({ component: CoolComponent }) {\r\n  const element = useMemo(() => React.createElement(CoolComponent), [CoolComponent]);\r\n  return element;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I'd really prefer to use JSX",
