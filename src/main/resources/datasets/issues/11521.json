I think ideally this would be a more tabular format, but I'm not sure if it's worth breaking the previous format of single line additions. I'm open to suggestions.\r\n\r\nIt also might be nice to log files that we have left to type annotate instead of files that are already done. That way it's easier to see what work still has to be done.\r\n\r\nThe new format would look something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n12958f1928bc0a file1annotated.js file2annotated.js 108/216\r\n```",
