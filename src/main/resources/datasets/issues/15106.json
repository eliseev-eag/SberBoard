I have created a minimal snack that is supposed to pass down some data to a grandchild. But on running the app I keep getting the error 'Device: (96:380) Unexpected context found on stack. This error is likely caused by a bug in React. Please file an issue.'\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nHere's the reproducible demo: \r\nhttps://snack.expo.io/@adititipnis/context-poc\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n",
