  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nQuestion about the interaction when using Hooks + Suspense. *I am aware that these are not finalized yet. Please close if this has already been considered.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nI tweeted about this:\r\n1. https://twitter.com/tazsingh/status/1083314900586373120\r\n2. https://twitter.com/tazsingh/status/1083329402308562944\r\n\r\nIn essence, Hooks require a full execution of a Component function to register. However, Suspense interrupts that execution such that Hooks aren't able to effectively register. As such, it's impossible to rely on the output of any Hooks until all suspended calls are resolved.\r\n\r\nSince the vision for Suspense is to use them as the primary async mechanism in React and since Hooks are meant to be composable items within a Component, where it isn't strictly important to be aware of what is contained in a Hook for it to be useful, I can see this as problematic if they cannot register properly because some other Hook has suspended.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to uncomment the section in this CodeSandbox to observe the behaviour I'm noticing. I also describe a related behaviour in my second tweet regarding usage of `useMemo`.\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/9y64nmkrzy\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nFrankly, I am unsure of the expected behaviour as I believe both of these features to be working as intended hence why I titled this issue as a \"question\". I am aware that I am using these features before they are released and proper communication of the usage between Hooks + Suspense is not yet available.\r\n\r\nIf this is the intended behaviour, cool üëç If not, I am happy to file a bug report accordingly.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16.8.0-alpha.0\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks! üôè ",
