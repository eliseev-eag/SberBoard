  "body": "Is there any way to get a string of plain html from a react component, but on the client side?\n\nMy app has a design editor that lets you click elements and edit their style, nothing new there, but I'm re-making it from the ground up using react both for the app itself and for the templates that should be edited inside an iframe and then rendered elsewhere.\n\nAttaching click handlers to every editable element conditionally (eg: if the view is being rendered inside an iframe, for the editor) would be a nightmare, and I can't just use jquery $('.is-editable').click() like I used to because of the virtual DOM.\n\nTaking all that in account, it seems that the only solution is rendering the would-be-edited view as plain HTML so I can use the $('.is-editable').click() approach inside my editor.\n\nAny insights or similar experiences?\n",
