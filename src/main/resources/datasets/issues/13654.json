  "body": "<!--\r\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\r\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nHonestly I don't know\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nI'm a moderator in the GreenSock forums and the most recent update (16.5.X) is causing some issues with the Draggable tool. By default the Draggable tool ignores clicks on specific elements so by default those are not draggable elements, unless you specify that the element should be draggable. Starting on version 16.5.0 a `noop` function is passed on the `onclick` event of the root element of a react app, which is preventing a simple `<div>` tag from being used by the Draggable tool.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/jrkbkxeqy\r\nThe blue square is not draggabl(should rotate). If you either uncomment line 24 or change the React and ReactDOM versions to 16.4.2, \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt shouldn't be necessary to add the indication to make the element Draggable, it should work by default just in any regular application or web page.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact: 16.5.0 - 16.5.1\r\nChrome 69 - Firefox 62 - IE11 - Edge 17\r\nWindows 7 64\r\nAlso other users have tested in Chrome and Firefox in OSX (don't know specific versions)",
