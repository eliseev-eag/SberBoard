  "body": "I'd like to report a bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nUsing input type=\"number\" will shave off any trailing 0s behind the seperator. \r\n\r\nSee e.g. https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/107/ -- the state starts as being \"3.0000\", but the number input only shows \"3\".\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe number input should show \"3.0000\". Or, at least provide a way to specify that toFixed is used with N numbers behind the seperator.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n^15.5.6, 15.6.x (tested in FF 53)\r\n\r\nIt goes wrong on these lines: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/stack/client/wrappers/ReactDOMInput.js#L192-L200",
