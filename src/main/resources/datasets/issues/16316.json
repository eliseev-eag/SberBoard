If an instance experiences any divergence in ancestral element types, then React will unmount and remount an instance that never left. \r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle:\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/embed/cranky-grothendieck-xtqnn\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nReact should use the **instance tree** as defined in this [document](https://github.com/gactjs/gact/blob/master/docs/view-tree-duality.md) to compute instance lifecycle. The computation of lifecycle can be complemented with a ```key``` based strategy in the rare cases when comparing instance trees would conflate two distinct instances. \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nall versions, all platforms ",
