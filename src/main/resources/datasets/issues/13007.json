  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIf an `input` element has the `type=\"number\"` attribute, the `value` attribute in the html will only be updated on blur. However, this isn't the case if the input element has the type `text`.\r\nYou can check it here: https://codesandbox.io/s/yk4zrm9pz\r\n(Just open the Developer Tools and have a look at the DOM elements while changing the values.)\r\n\r\n**Why do I need this?**\r\nFrom react side everything seems to be correct (on the first look). The onChange handler is getting fired and the value is changed when updating it via `setState`. But if the `step` attribute is changed during stepping up and down with the browser input arrows or the keyboard arrow keys, then it's not always stepping the correct step value. And that's just because the DOM element doesn't have the correct value in the value attribute.\r\nHere's an example: https://codesandbox.io/s/3ql999xo8p\r\n(Just step down (with the down arrow key) and the up again.)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe `value` attribute of the DOM element should also update on change if the input type is `number`.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nLatest react version (16.4.0)\r\nTested in Chrome and Firefox on macOS and Windows\r\n",
