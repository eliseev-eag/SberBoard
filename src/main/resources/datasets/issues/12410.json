  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIn any `input` of type `radio`, if I control it with the `checked` props and a handler to the `onClick` event, I still receive a warning that the form field needs a `onChange` handler. To suppress this warning, I pass an useless inline function to the `onChange` props.\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nNot give a warning if I control the component with an event other than `onChange`. I can't assure all possibilities but it's very common for me to control `radio` inputs with `onClick` handlers.\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16.2.0\r\n\r\nI didn't test this behavior with a `checkbox` input, but I wonder that the same behavior would be desirable.",
