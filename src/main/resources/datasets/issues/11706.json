  "body": "Hi, I'm working on a library that proxy's SVG elements so you can mutate the SVG Element when it has loaded.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/lifeiscontent/react-svg-injector\r\n\r\nI noticed that when I added an `onClick` prop to my Mutate component it didn't map properly as in javascript the proper syntax is `onclick`.\r\n\r\nHere is where the code I'm working on lives: https://github.com/lifeiscontent/react-svg-injector/blob/master/lib/mutate.js#L17\r\n\r\nI'm wondering how ReactDOM does this internally so I can have a consistent API with my library.\r\n\r\nany support on this topic is greatly appreciated, thanks!",
