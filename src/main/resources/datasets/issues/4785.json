  "body": "We're getting close to that time of the release cycle so time to update the authors. If I mentioned you below, it would be good to hear if I made the right decision (either selecting an email address or name) or if you'd like something changed.\n\nI'll run this all again right before we ship to catch anybody else that comes in. But as of right now we have _186_ new names since we cut 0.13. Thank you to all of you who have contributed over the past few months.\n\n---\n### I pulled name from your GH profile. Is that ok?\n- [x] @Wildhoney\n- [x] @codesuki\n- [x] @oluckyman\n- [x] @mheiber (well, I figured it out from your email address)\n- [x] @katzoo\n- [x] @himkt\n- [x] @eriklharper (ditto on email address)\n- [x] @Smert\n### Your names mostly match your GH username. Would you like to use a different name? (non-latin characters ok!):\n- [ ] @Youmoo\n- [x] @yiminghe\n- [x] @xmo-odoo \n- [x] @thorn0\n- [x] @sugarshin\n- [x] @matchu\n- [x] @lili21\n- [x] @laiso\n- [x] @jiyeonseo\n- [x] @iamdoron\n- [x] @wibud\n- [x] @mbrookes\n- [x] @zhangjg\n- [x] @jw-00000\n### You had commits from multiple email addresses. Are you ok with email address I mapped to (first one in `.mailmap`)?\n- [x] @AnSavvides\n- [x] @bhamodi\n- [x] @jeffchan\n- [x] @KevinTCoughlin\n- [x] @Yeti-or\n- [x] @mmoss \n- [x] @mihaip\n- [x] @MichelleTodd\n- [ ] @undernewmanagement\n",
