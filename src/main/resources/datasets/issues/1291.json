  "body": "As per React's [documentation](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/interactivity-and-dynamic-uis.html#what-components-should-have-state), when communication between multiple views:\n\n\"A common pattern is to create several stateless components that just render data, and have a stateful component above them in the hierarchy that passes its state to its children via props.\"\n\nIn the course of learning React, I could not find a good example which illustrates this scenario. I came up with this simple example (inspired by the existing caltrain app for ios) for the above mentioned use case. Wanted to submit it to the repo so that it would be helpful for others.\n",
