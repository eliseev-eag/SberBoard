  "body": "Hi Team,\r\n\r\nCould you please develop a Open  API (https://swagger.io/specification/#specification)  like design specification for react. Such a specification written in YAML file could help automate the process of  routing, creation of navigation/bar links and also some boilerplate code for components. As the components are building blocks of react, in a large application with too many components it' a bit boring task to create components by hand. If we have a specification in YAML then such tasks would be easier. \r\n\r\nInitially we can start by creating a simple mapping of routes/url to components and later see to fit more features like props, state etc, auto import required libraries, static UI elements, etc\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nArun\r\n",
