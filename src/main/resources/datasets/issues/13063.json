  "body": "This is a risibly minor issue, but I wanted to bring it up in case there's a super easy fix to it. In older versions of React, doing `e.constructor.name` on synthetic events would report the constructor class' name, but right now it reports a generic `Class`, due to the way SyntheticEvent is extended:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/ae14317d6810d5b07d01308a2116a707e5e09983/packages/events/SyntheticEvent.js#L219-L238\r\n\r\nI'm in the process of bringing this small tool up to date, and I've upgraded from React 15.4 to React 16.4, and I get lots of `Class` logs:\r\nhttps://danburzo.github.io/input-methods/\r\n\r\n(The workaround is to just assume Class = some subclass of SyntheticEvent, but it would be nice to have a more precise name?)",
