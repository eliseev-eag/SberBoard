  "body": "Fresh Babel plugin emits \"signatures\" that are strings containing names of Hooks and call metadata. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default function App() {\r\n  _s();\r\n\r\n  const [foo, setFoo] = useState(0);\r\n  React.useEffect(() => {});\r\n  return <h1>{foo}</h1>;\r\n}\r\n\r\n_s(App, \"useState{[foo, setFoo](0)}\\\\nuseEffect{}\"); // <-- signature\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the signature contains `[foo, setFoo](0)`. This ensures that if we change the `foo` name, or if we change the initial state (`0`), we force a remount. Including the initial argument source code is a special case for `useState` and `useReducer` since that usually signals an intentional attempt to remount.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it's not always safe to emit an arbitrary string in some environments. For example, in www we have a transform that replaces `cx(\"foo\")` with some string hash *regardless of whether it's inside a string or not*. It's just a regex. So if an expression like this becomes a part of a signature, www transforms can produce a syntax error.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we can default to always emitting hashes for signatures. They're guaranteed to be short, and can't cause these kinds of issues. I left a fallback for ASTExplorer and for our own snapshot tests. (However, our integration tests verify the other branch still works.)",
