  "body": "If I try to use the Search by Component Name panel, it only captures some of my keystrokes.  I suspect it is burning cycles filtering the list, so it isn't available to catch the remaining keystrokes.\n\nPerhaps this could be solved with a web worker.  Send it searches as you receive the keystrokes, let it do the filtering in the background, and return the results to the UI thread.\n\nJust a thought - I don't know how the search is implemented, but it should certainly not be missing keystrokes.\n",
