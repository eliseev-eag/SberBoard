  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe documentation of React Context states that\r\n\r\n> All Consumers that are descendants of a Provider will re-render whenever the\r\n> Providerâ€™s value prop changes... Changes are determined by comparing the new\r\n> and old values using the same algorithm as Object.is.\r\n\r\nThe example shows that that is not the case.  A provider is re-rendered with the\r\nsame identical value, and as indicated by the counter, the consumer re-renders\r\nevery time the provider is rendered, regardless of whether the value has\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nAm I misunderstanding the docs?  If this is the intended behavior, how can\r\ncontext be used efficiently?\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/g8y4hcbj/1/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nWould only indicate the one initial render. Subsequent renders would not cause\r\nconsumers of `Provider1` to re-render because its value hasn't changed.  This is\r\nthe case for all types of values (scalar, object, function, etc.).\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nObserved in 16.3.0, 16.3.1, and 16.3.2.\r\n",
