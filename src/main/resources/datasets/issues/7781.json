  "body": "So I already chimed in about the problems here:\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6556\n\nBut there's another issue where you type out your number, such as `123.45` and then start deleting and once you delete that 4, the cursor jobs all the way over to the left\n\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/wmhrdcad/\n\nI think the problem has to do with the fact that `\\d+\\.` is not considered a valid number. I'm not sure if this came from react or the browser:\n\n> The specified value \"0.\" is not a valid number. The value must match to the following regular expression: -?(\\d+|\\d+.\\d+|.\\d+)([eE][-+]?\\d+)?\n",
