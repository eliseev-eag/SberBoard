  "body": "This is an invitation to discussion...\r\n\r\nSo, react is pretty freaking awesome and I used it quite a bit. One thing unfortunately where react is not as strong is in performance, which gave roots to Inferno and Preact. Although, this is generally a non-issue on desktop, while mobile might be a bottleneck.\r\n\r\nI know many members of the team have been working on improving bundle size (I believe through rollup support in a talk I heard), asynchronous scheduling, etc. I am also aware that @trueadm (the creator of inferno) joined the React team and is working on improving it.\r\n\r\nThe point I want to bring up is this library [petit-dom](https://github.com/yelouafi/petit-dom). It uses, is a diff algorithm (links that explain it provided in the README) and it seems to score incredibly on [vdom performance tests](https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark). In fact, it is only beat by 2 technologies, vanillajs and surplusjs [per the benchmark snapshot](https://rawgit.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark/master/webdriver-ts-results/table.html).\r\n\r\npetit-dom beats inferno, preact, mithril, vue, angular, etc. Of course, it is not a proper js framework, however the point I am trying to make is that it is far faster and a major difference between the other frameworks seems to be its diff algorithm.\r\n\r\nI realize this would mean a rewrite of a good portion of react-dom, which is why it is simply a discussion :D.\r\n\r\nIf this is unfeasible, or simply going after the wrong target/bottleneck, let me know as it is after all a discussion.",
