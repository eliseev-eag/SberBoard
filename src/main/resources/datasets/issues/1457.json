  "body": "I got into a bit of trouble trying to render-one-thing-or-not, wrapped in a `CSSTransitionGroup`.\n\nIt seems that `CSSTransitionGroup` can gracefully handle going from having a non-null child, to having an empty array of children, and back, but it can't handle going from having something non-null as a child, to having something null as a child.\n\nTest case:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/steveluscher/f872k/\n\nIt dies in `componentWillReceiveProps` of the `CSSTransitionGroup` component, because `nextChildMapping` is null.\n\n``` js\nfor (key in prevChildMapping) {\n  if (!nextChildMapping.hasOwnProperty(key) &&\n    !this.currentlyTransitioningKeys[key]) {\n      this.keysToLeave.push(key);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n",
