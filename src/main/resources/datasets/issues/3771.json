  "body": "I came across this speed test using react and removed a hidden element in the table load to see how it impacted the speed. When you remove the hidden element the speed gets 4x better. The element was a simple td element that had inline styles to hide it. I was just surprised at the speed difference and wanted to know why this was happening. Is it because of inline styles or it being a hidden element?\n\nTest with hidden element\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/99598482/react-hidden-element-speed-test/initial-load/react-with-hidden-element%20copy.html\n\nTest no hidden element\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/99598482/react-hidden-element-speed-test/initial-load/react-no-hidden-element.html\n",
