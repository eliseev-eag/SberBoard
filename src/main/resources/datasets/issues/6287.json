  "body": "I’m not feeling strong about this but I would like to get these two methods renamed before 15.0.\n### `printDOM()` → `printOperations()`\n\n`printDOM()` is really popular one but since `ReactPerf` can be used together with React Native, the name doesn’t really do it justice. In #6046, we let renderers emit arbitrary `NATIVE_OPERATION` events so React Native won’t be confined to the [current list of “DOM operations”](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/8046cbda10fc024bc3f12b39923736df78c8ffe5/src/test/ReactDefaultPerfAnalysis.js#L18-L32) either. This is why I’m renaming `printDOM()` to `printOperations()`.\n### `getMeasurementsSummaryMap()` → `getWasted()`\n\nThe second rename concerns `getMeasurementsSummaryMap()` which was added in #2219. Its name is already somewhat confusing because it doesn’t actually return a map—it returns an array. Additionally, it sounds very generic but it actually corresponds to a very specific dataset: the table printed by `printWasted()`.\n\nIn #6046 I plan to expose a `get*` method for every `print*` method so it makes sense that `getWasted()` exists as a match to `printWasted()` in 15.0, complemented by other `get*()` methods such as `getInclusive()` and `getOperations()` when #6046 ships some time during 15.x.\n\nOne thing I’m not sure about is whether `getWasted()` invites an unnecessary connotation for fluent English speakers. I’m open to improvements that offer another way of maintaining consistency with the upcoming changes, e.g. `getWastedStats()`, `getInclusiveStats()`, etc.\n### Why Do This Now\n\nThis is our opportunity to rename some methods on the API that’s going to significantly change internally, and I think it’s worth doing it before shipping 15.0. Since people rely on `getMeasurementsSummaryMap()` for things like CI (#2219), in my opinion it would be unwise to introduce a deprecation warning in something other than a major release, as a new warning can potentially break CIs.\n### Deprecation Strategy\n\nWe will keep the old method name working in v15 with a deprecation warning, and remove it during or after v16 when most tutorials have been updated.\n### Reviewers\n\n@sebmarkbage @jimfb \n",
