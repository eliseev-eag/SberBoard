  "body": "Fixes a bug where the timeout passed to `scheduleCallback` represented an absolute timestamp, instead of the amount of time until that timestamp is reached. The solution is to subtract the current time from the expiration.\r\n\r\nThe bug wasn't caught by other tests because we use virtual times that default to 0, and most tests don't advance time.\r\n\r\nI also moved the `initialTimeMs` offset to the `SchedulerWithReactIntegration` module so that we don't have to remember to subtract the offset every time. (We should consider upstreaming this to the Scheduler package.)",
