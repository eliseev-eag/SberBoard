  "body": "Hi, I want to make a feature request for adding a way to delay enter/appear/leave for `ReactCSSTransitionGroup` component.\r\n\r\nI propose adding new props to `ReactCSSTransitionGroup`:\r\n- **transitionEnterDelay** Delay in `ms` after which element begins `enter` transition. *Defaults to 0.*\r\n- **transitionAppearDelay** Delay in `ms` after which element begins `appear` transition. *Defaults to 0.*\r\n- **transitionLeaveDelay** Delay in  `ms` after which element begins `leave` transition. *Defaults to 0.*\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n <ReactCSSTransitionGroup\r\n          transitionName=\"example\"\r\n          transitionEnterDelay={300}\r\n          transitionEnterTimeout={500}\r\n          transitionAppear\r\n          transitionAppearDelay={300}\r\n          transitionAppearTimeout={500}\r\n          transitionLeaveDelay={0}\r\n          transitionLeaveTimeout={300}\r\n>\r\n          {items}\r\n</ReactCSSTransitionGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\n> As all defaults for proposed props are 0 it would't add breaking changes for existing `ReactCSSTransitionGroup` users.\r\n\r\nThe example before describes my reasons behind the request.\r\n\r\n### Use case \r\nI'm currently creating an project that contains navigable subpages and each subpage has a unique enter and leave animation **with a unique enter/leave duration and it is possible to change to any subpage from another in any order**. When changing to a new page the previous subpage leave must end before the new page begins entering in. So I need to delay the entering of the new subpage until old one leaves.\r\n\r\nCurrently I have an object that defines enter/leave durations for each of the subpages and a helper function `calcPageTimeouts(currentPage, lastPage)` that calculates the correct timeouts and delays for current subpage for the  `ReactCSSTransitionGroup` component depending on current state.\r\n\r\nEach subpage contains multiple different elements that in combination creates an enter/leave animation sequences. As `ReactCSSTransitionGroup` enter/leave transitions are CSS class based, it's not possible to add a additional `transition-delay` on an parent element. To add needed behaviour I would need to entirely manage the enter/leave stuff in Javascript rather in CSS by adding a class. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
