  "body": "Adds a better warning for these cases:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Case 1: watching a global (this is broken)\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  console.log(window.innerWidth)\r\n}, [window.innerWidth])\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  console.log(GlobalStore.thing)\r\n}, [GlobalStore.thing])\r\n\r\n// Case 2: just unnecessary dep\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  console.log('hello')\r\n}, [console])\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe used to warn before, too, but the message wasn't very specific (it just said it's unused). Later https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/14967 disabled that message for effects, but that wasn't intentional. This particular case should still warn.\r\n\r\nThis PR re-adds the warnings along with a bunch of new tests covering it. It detects if we used an identifier that's outside the component scope, and warns that it's essentially a mutable value.\r\n\r\nIn the docs, we'll explain that the fix is either to omit it, or (if you really want to track it), put it into state and update appropriately.",
