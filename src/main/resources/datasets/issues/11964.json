  "body": "\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThe shallow renderer defaults a class component's state to empty object if it's not set. \"Real\" renderers don't seem to do this, so a component can render successfully in the shallow renderer, but fail at runtime in the browser with a null reference error.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.**\r\nHere is ReactDOM's behavior (crashes reading an uninitialized state value): https://codesandbox.io/s/4jv82zmp0\r\nHere is the shallow renderer behavior (component able to render): https://codesandbox.io/s/pp733nrxzq\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThey initialize state in the same way.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16. This wasn't an issue in React 15.",
