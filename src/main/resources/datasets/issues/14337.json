  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug (possibly)\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nThis may, in fact, fall under the purview of `Only special keys are supported, all others depend on keyboard layout or browser` but figured I'd enter this to be sure.  Additionally, the bookmark in the link specified in the `@see` comment is no longer valid so I can't confirm the official list of keys.  Looking at [the latest version of the spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents/#determine-keydown-keyup-keyCode), the key in question appears in the `Optionally fixed virtual keys` section rather than the `Fixed virtual keys` section, but then, none of the 1xx keys appear at all in the fixed list.\r\n\r\nThe `translateToKey` hash in the `react-dom` package's `getEventKey` function appears to be missing the `-` (dash) key.  When used with CTRL+SHIFT, this key (and probably others) is reported as `Unidentified` in IE11 and since it's not in the `translateToKey` map, returns back to the code as `Unidentified` which breaks keyboard shortcut handling.\r\n\r\nThis can be seen by navigating to https://w3c.github.io/uievents/tools/key-event-viewer.html and in IE11, pressing `CTRL + SHIFT + -` (note that you will need to check `keydown` under `preventDefault` in the options table or the browser will zoom out.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIf it's a bug, it shouldn't allow resolution to just fall through back to the browser.  If it's not, then the code is correct - but then requires special handling.\r\n\r\nIf I add `'189': '-'` to the hash, it works...on a US Keyboard.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nTested on React 16.6.1 in IE11 on Windows.",
