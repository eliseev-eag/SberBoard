  "body": "a first crack at flushing the scheduler manually from inside `act()`. \r\n- uses `unstable_flushWithoutYielding()` directly instead of `flushAll()` \r\n- for tests to pass, I mostly replaced `toFlushAndYield(...)` with `toHaveYielded()`. \r\n- for a few tests that tested the state of the tree before flushing effects (but still after updates), I replaced `act()` with `batchedUpdates()`.\r\n\r\nOpen questions - \r\n- uh, is this right? - edit: yes. \r\n- `unstable_flushWithoutYielding` is an odd name, especially when it's followed by `toHaveYielded`. Or am I doing something wrong here? Or should one of these named differently? edit: yup, the names are confusing. will change in a followup PR\r\n\r\ntodo\r\n- [x] add a warning when scheduler isn't mocked (but fallback to a version that works in sync mode)\r\n- [x] make a umd build of scheduler/unstable_mock \r\n- [x] more tests for concurrent mode\r\n- [ ] make a docs page/link explaining more",
