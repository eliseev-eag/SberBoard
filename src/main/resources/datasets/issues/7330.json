  "body": "❗️Not ready to be merged into `master`, still a work in progress❗️\n\nIntroducing the React Release Manager, built to replace all of the manual steps involved in maintaining & shipping React.\n\nPrimary focus so far has been the most time-intensive & error prone steps. But automating more of this process is super important as we want to be able to turn around releases much more quickly, and ensure more people feel confident doing it (I've run almost every release since we started)\n\nQuick overview:\n- `docs-prs`: replaces a GH label search, opening a bunch of tabs, copying the merge sha, cherry-pick each of those, push, batch remove label on GH\n- `stable-prs`: similar docs process but with milestones\n- `version`: replaces manually editing a bunch of files before release (or other similar steps, eventually became me using `patch`)\n- `npm-publish`: replaces a couple commands in my shell history, or a fancy `ls build/packages/*.tgz | xargs -n1 npm publish`\n\nPlans:\n- `publish`: do the whole thing\n- `version-start`: create/update branches for release prep work (eg, just shipped 15.3.0, make sure dev branch exists)\n- `changelog`: generate a naive version of the changelog from X to Y (maybe just added to `stable-prs` command)\n- a whole bunch of refinement and error handling, state checking (eg, don't try to do anything if git state is dirty or on the wrong branch)\n",
