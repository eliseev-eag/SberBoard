  "body": "*bug*\r\n\r\nAfter updating from 15.3.2 to 15.4.0, the error is showing up in previously working code.  The app fails to load in **IE11 on Win 7** with the following error:\r\n\r\n`SCRIPT5022: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {$$typeof, type, key, ref, props, _owner, _store}). If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead or wrap the object using createFragment(object) from the React add-ons. Check the render method of `App`.\r\nFile: bundle.js, Line: 13847, Column: 6`\r\n\r\nIt continues to work fine in all other browsers.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n",
