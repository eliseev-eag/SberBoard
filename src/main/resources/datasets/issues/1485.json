  "body": "I'm having a particular problem where the rendering of some HTML is delayed by a CSS3 translate3d animation. This happens on all browsers I've tested (Android 4.1 webview, iOS 7, Chrome for Mac, Safari for Mac).\n\nI have a `<ul>` that acts as a container for my pages. Every li represents a page. The overflow property is set to hidden, so you can only see one page at a time.\n\nWhen I want to transition to a new page, I set translate3d to the correct value, and along with transition-duration property, it slides the new page into the view. The funny thing is, the new page isn't rendered before the transition is finished (so it slides in a white page, when the animation is done, the view is displayed).\n\nI can see that the html is inserted before the transition, so it seems to be delaying the rendering of the new <li> element until after the transition is done.\n\nI've also tried updateing the transform3d property 200ms after I insert the new <li> element, when I do this, the view is rendered halfway through the animation.\n\nIf I remove the transition-duration property, there is of course no animation, but the <li> element is rendered instantly.\n\nAny way I can solve this? Has anyone experienced something similar?\n\nExample code: http://jsfiddle.net/9RrAN/\n",
