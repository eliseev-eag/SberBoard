  "body": "I decided to try out React today, and began following the Getting Started Guide for using[ React from npm](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html#using-react-from-npm).  Unfortunately I was unable to get the example up and running.  The first problem I encountered was the missing HTML file which I scavenged from lower in the page and adapted.  However once I loaded up the `bundle.js` file in the HTML page I received the following error in the browser console:\n\n`Uncaught Invariant Violation: _registerComponent(...): Target container is not a DOM element.`\n\nWas there a step I missed somewhere?\n",
