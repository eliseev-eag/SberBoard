  "body": "This adds `addons/` to the linted directories. I figured this was necessary because it was too easy to introduce undefined variables and similar issues.\r\n\r\nTo do this, I had to introduce Prettier to `addons/`, run it on them (with no manual changes), and then do a few mostly cosmetic fixes in https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/a56ea2a70be3ce4059f292cec46125bfa3c4e9fd to fix all existing lint issues.\r\n\r\nI recognize this significantly touches the source, but since we decided to establish a proper process, I need the confidence that linting gives me before making any other changes, or working on builds.",
