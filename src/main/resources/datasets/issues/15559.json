  "body": "There are multiple problems with it:\r\n\r\n* It requires that React keeps track of currently rendering component (since it can't guess `this`). This makes React a bit slower.\r\n* It doesn't work as most people would expect with the \"render callback\" pattern (e.g. `<DataGrid renderRow={this.renderRow} />`) because the ref would get placed on `DataGrid` for the above reason.\r\n* It is not composable, i.e. if a library puts a ref on the passed child, the user can't put another ref on it (e.g. #8734). Callback refs are perfectly composable.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @gaearon in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8333#issuecomment-271648615_",
