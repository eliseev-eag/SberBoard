  "body": "As proposed in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8495#issuecomment-271311978, I think we should find the warnings where we add a dynamic part to the end (like `\"Check the render method of <...>\"`) and delimit it with two newlines. This way itâ€™s much easier to recognize in the middle of a bunch of errors:\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/810438/21771524/9b3aeccc-d67f-11e6-8f5d-dfe0dd195d2f.png)\r\n\r\nThis is a good first issue to contribute. You would need to find `warning()` calls that include additional info like `Check the render method of` and add a couple of newlines. You'd also need to change the tests in case they fail.",
