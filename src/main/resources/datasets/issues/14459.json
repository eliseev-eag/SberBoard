  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nA feature.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nReact.Suspense currently supports only React.lazy components which are tailored to be used with dynamic `import` of modules with predefined names and default exports.\r\n\r\nIf a promise of a component is supposed to be returned, a component should be wrapped with redundant `{ default: ... }` object:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst LazyFoo = React.lazy(async () => {\r\n  const { Foo } = await import('third-party-package');\r\n  return { default: Foo };\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n`lazy` function has no parameters, it's not possible to make lazy component parametrized with props:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst LazyWetFoo = React.lazy(noPropsHere => import('third-party-package/foo'));\r\nconst LazyWetBar = React.lazy(noPropsHere => import('third-party-package/bar'));\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen `lazy` is used with arbitrary promise of a component, it's not possible to provide dynamic behaviour to a promise via props:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst LazyBaz42 = React.lazy(async (noPropsHere) => {\r\n  const answer = 42; // the component is hard-coded to answer with 42\r\n  const result = await fetchData(`/answer?${prop}`);\r\n  return { default: props => <Answer ...props>{result}</Answer> };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThere is general-purpose promise component type that receives props that were passed to it and returns a promise of React element:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst LazyBaz = React.resolver(async ({ answer, ...props) => {\r\n  const result = await fetchData(`/answer?${answer}`);\r\n  return <Answer ...props>{result}</Answer>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nReact.lazy is a special case of React.resolver, its signature is optionally changed to receive same props as those that would be passed to lazy-loaded component:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst LazyFoobar = React.lazy(({ fooOrBar }) => import(`third-party-package/${fooOrBar}`));\r\n```\r\n\r\nReact.Suspense supports both of them.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nAll versions (16.7.0@alpha.2 and lower)",
