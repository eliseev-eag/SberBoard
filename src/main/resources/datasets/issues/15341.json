  "body": "This PR changes the React `Profiler` to use an experimental `performance.instructionCount` API (instead of `performance.now`) if/when available. This change is gated behind a new `enableProfilerExperimentalInstructionCount` feature flag which has been turned off for open source builds (and is enabled only for Facebook builds).\r\n\r\nThis change has implications for the values passed to `Profiler` `onRender` (since these would be milliseconds _or_ instructions) but I think we can mostly ignore these, since it's highly unlikely the instruction count API would be enabled by default in Chrome for security reasons. Given that, it's likely that this data would only be used by e.g. companies like Facebook who have infra built up around it _or_ perhaps by developers launching Chromium with an opt-in flag (TBD). In either case, it's understood that the values being reported are _intentionally_ not timestamps.\r\n\r\nSebastian and I briefly discussed the possibility of just overriding `performance.now` to return this value so that the `Profiler` didn't need any special awareness of the new API, but I have concerns that (1) this would cause Profiler to be unable to track wall time and (2) potentially cause downstream breakage for e.g. throttling, debounce, etc.",
