  "body": "It would be beneficial to prepend some sort of \"this code is automatically generated, do not modify by hand\" comment to files built with the `jsx` binary. \n\nThis is likely to reduce developer confusion, and can also simplify code reviews so that time is not wasted reviewing both the JSX source and the JS output (plus tools such as Phabricator will auto-detect the string `@generated` in changed files and display an appropriate message in the review)\n\nI'd suggest having this be the default behavior since I don't think there are major downsides to it. Alternate options would include some sort of [managed macro](http://managing.blue/2014/09/30/ansible_managed/) or a `--prefix path/to/file` flag.\n",
