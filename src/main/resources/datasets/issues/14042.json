(maybe) or I could be using the hook wrong*\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen using `useEffect`, the current state value is not available in the state, only the old state value is available.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.

Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.7.0-alpha.0\r\n\r\n[code.zip](https://github.com/facebook/react/files/2532110/5xwjrjwo74.zip)\r\n",
