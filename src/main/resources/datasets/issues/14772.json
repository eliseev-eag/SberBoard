  "body": "React V 16.8\r\n\r\nIm using jsdom and enzyme to unit test my lib. When i updated to V16.8 this morning I started getting the following. I think it has to do with the fact that test utils is a js IIFE, and the jsdom document object has not been created yet. \r\n\r\n```\r\n/Users/n0280500/Documents/Dev/ReactTools/informed/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-test-utils.development.js:944\r\nvar actContainerElement = document.createElement('div');\r\n\r\nReferenceError: document is not defined\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more context: I have a setup file that gets executed before any of my enzyme tests as described by the docs https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/guides/jsdom.html",
