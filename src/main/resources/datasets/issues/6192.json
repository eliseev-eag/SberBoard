  "body": "Using V8 as a backend with snapshots enabled. To optimize performance, it is beneficial to create snapshots to improve server side rendering performance. After creating snapshot with React.js + ReactServer.js, the resulting server side component rendering errors as follows:\n\n```\nInvariant Violation: Trying to release an instance into a pool of a different type.\n```\n\nThe logic that is causing the error is the **Math.random()** function, which has issues with [snapshots and V8](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=4810). There are 5 areas where this function is used. At the moment, the biggest problem for server side rendering is the following location; however, the other 4 will also impact if code reached the Math.random() at runtime.\n\n``` js\n/**\n * Size of the reactRoot ID space. We generate random numbers for React root\n * IDs and if there's a collision the events and DOM update system will\n * get confused. In the future we need a way to generate GUIDs but for\n * now this will work on a smaller scale.\n */\nvar GLOBAL_MOUNT_POINT_MAX = Math.pow(2, 53);\n\nvar ServerReactRootIndex = {\n  createReactRootIndex: function () {\n    return Math.ceil(Math.random() * GLOBAL_MOUNT_POINT_MAX);\n  }\n};\n```\n\nWould it be possible to fix this such that server side heap snapshots can be generated without having to worry about issues with server `Math.random()`? Could some sort of algorithm that doesn't rely on Math.random() be used to generate the nodes, root indexes, etc.?\n# \n\nOS: Ubuntu 14.04 x64\nV8: 5.0.104\nReact: 0.14.7\n",
