  "body": "I want to group package-level imports separately from imports reaching into other packages. I think this provides a better mental picture of what’s being shared between renderers. We were also sort of doing this with `fbjs` anyway before, now we just have more packages.\r\n\r\nI think this is especially useful in DOM client code where there’s a mix of local DOM-specific `../events` and global `events/` references. Same with local `../shared` and global `shared/`.\r\n\r\nIn the past we used the “separate import” convention for lowercase modules like `isCustomElement` but I don’t see much sense in this grouping. It doesn’t convey a real semantic difference.\r\n\r\nFinally, I don’t care too strongly about this. Not enough to enforce it via lint yet. But after ES modules are done, and we don‘t have weird `require`s in `__DEV__` blocks I’d be happy to automatically enforce it with an autofix lint rule that would run right before Prettier.\r\n\r\nI verified FB and open source bundles still work.",
