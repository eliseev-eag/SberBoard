This happens specially after signing in with Facebook account.\r\n\r\n1- To use it first login with the following account\r\nuser: github@myapp.com\r\npassword: github\r\n2- Login with any Facebook account, you will see the cPU starting to raise up to maybe ~100%\r\n3- The app requires to have a FAcebook Page and initiate a Live Streaming event to that FB Page in order to monitor it with the app. (you can use your phone for that and make the stream private). Once your Live stream is LIVE, press the START button... once you press START, cpu goes to 300%. and stays there. \r\n\r\nthe START button initiates a connection to a SERVER-SENT-EVENT. but that's all. \r\n\r\nThe app was created using create-react-app command, and uploaded for production using *npm run build\"\r\n\r\nFirefox on the other hand, stays within 60% cpu. but Chrome.. turns on my fans and my laptop gets hot.\r\n\r\nAny idea what could I be doing wrong ?",
