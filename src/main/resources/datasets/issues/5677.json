  "body": "This is probably a question / documentation issue.\n\n```\nvar Aquarium = ({species}) => (\n  <Tank>\n    {getFish(species)}\n  </Tank>\n);\n```\n\nIn some places of the doc we can read:\n\nhttps://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html\n\n> In an ideal world, most of your components would be stateless functions because these stateless components can follow a faster code path within the React core. This is the recommended pattern, when possible.\n\nhttps://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html\n\n> This pattern is designed to encourage the creation of these simple components that should comprise large portions of your apps. In the future, weâ€™ll also be able to make performance optimizations specific to these components by avoiding unnecessary checks and memory allocations.\n\nWhat I find unclear is these explainations is how React optimize the rendering when using stateless functional components. The good sense would be that React uses something similar to `shallowEqual` to know if it has to call the function or not, but as React does not enforce strict immutability yet (I mean the PureRenderMixin is actually an option, not the default), I wonder how these functional components behave.\n\nI think this should be better documented if any memoization technique is used when rendering these functional components, because it's not so obvious to me if my app will perform almost the same (or better) if I choose to replace all my components using PureRenderMixin and no state/lifecycle methods by functional components as I don't have much insights of the internal working of the optimizations done.\n",
