  "body": "Not sure if it is a bug or just general confusion. Tried only with 0.12.2, not with master.\n\n`this.forceUpdate();` crashes when a component is not mounted, which in itself makes sense, I'd say. However, if you call `this.forceUpdate()` directly in `componentWillMount`, it _doesn't_ crash, which suggests that it's OK to do (just as `setState` is OK to call there).\n\nThis happens if you use a Flux-like architecture but don't use the `componentDidMount`/`setState` combination (as Flux suggests) but `componentWillMount`/`forceUpdate`.\n\nThe error that you get is \"Invariant Violation: receiveComponent(...): Can only update a mounted component.\"\n\nThis example shows the problem: http://jsfiddle.net/8s9we7gj/3/\n",
