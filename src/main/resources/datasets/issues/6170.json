  "body": "I'm just going to start this as a thread to give everyone notice of work being put into the core reconciliation algorithm.\n\nThis will need to include features like:\n- Incremental updates in chunks. Maybe even two different versions of the same tree at the same time!\n- Back and forth yielding (and prerender) to support layout. This probably also includes a new type of \"context\".\n- Error boundaries that catches updates.\n- Make this work with existing tooling such as dev tools, perf tools, server rendering, various renderers.\n\nIf you're working on fixing issues with life-cycles or the core reconciliation parts (like child reconciliation) then you might want to be aware that this is a moving target. There might be requests for changes unrelated to the status quo but related to this future work. It might require a lot of context and commitment to be able to contribute to these parts.\n\nHowever, if what you're fixing is DOM issues, packaging, builds, diffing of props for styles, react native etc. Then it is probably unrelated to this work and you should feel free to send out PRs.\n",
