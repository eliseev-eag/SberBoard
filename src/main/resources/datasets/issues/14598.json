  "body": "Since performance of react 16 boosts so much and thanks to those aweosome talks on YouTube explained fiber so detailed, I hardly figured out even the latest version of react 16 is still in sync mode, no features like time slicing are turned on by default.\r\n\r\nThen I wondered why the perfmance is pretty good compared with react 15 even though? \r\n\r\nTrying to get some info on google, but it seems like no one really looked into this question. Even react 16 is shipped with this “fake” fiber mode for such a long time, it is not well documented or explained on the official website.\r\n\r\nCan someone give me some ideas about this please? ",
