  "body": "The point of running \"derequire\" is to rename the `require` calls to something else. Well, minifying already does this in its mangle step. You still need \"derequire\" for the non-minified bundles though :disappointed:\n\nThis reduces the run time of `grunt build` from ~52sec to ~36sec on my machine (~30% less time). I can also shave off an extra 2-3 seconds by updating derequire's outdated `esprima-fb` and `estraverse` - I'll put in a PR for that in that project later.\n\n/cc @zpao \n",
