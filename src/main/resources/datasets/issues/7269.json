  "body": "This issue was discovered while building an editor in Draft-JS (see original issue filed [here](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/501))\n\nEdge provides a TextEvent - but it's still not useful.  Disabling canUseTextInputEvent in React for Edge fixes the Draft-JS issue.\n\nTo reproduce the bug in Draft-JS:\n\nGo to https://facebook.github.io/draft-js\ntype \"a\"\nhit enter\ntype ctrl-a to select everything\ntype \"j\"\n\nYou'll get a javascript error. The editor (actually, the ReactDomComponent) is then in a confused state.\n\nThe DOM component that the react component points to is prematurely removed.\n",
