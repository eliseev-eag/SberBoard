It appears to be stripped out by React.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nI am testing a Web Component integration with React. Given a collection of possible attributes and values to test, I map through them and create multiple buttons,\r\n\r\n```js\r\n[\r\n...\r\n  {\r\n    href: 'https://google.com/',\r\n    text: 'Link',\r\n    id: 'c'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    size: 'jumbo',\r\n    text: 'Jumbo',\r\n    id: 'd'\r\n  },\r\n...\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<dls-button key={id} href={href} label={label} size={size} theme={theme} type={type} width={width}>{text}</dls-button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `href`, `label`, `theme`, `type`, and `width` attributes are rendered when they have a value, as expected. However, the `size` attribute is missing.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe `size` attribute and its value should be rendered.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nreact@16.3.2\r\nGoogle Chrome 66.0.3359.139\r\n\r\nAll of this custom element's attributes function as expected when integrated with Angular or in a vanilla setup, but not with React.",
