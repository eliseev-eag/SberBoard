  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\n\nAFAIK, this is a bug.\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\n\nWhen setting `checked` on a checkbox, the checkbox indeed is checked, but the attribute isn't actually in the DOM. This means that checkbox will be targeted by `:checked`, but not `[checked]`. In my case, it is a blocker regarding Selenium-powered tests as we use XPath to target elements and `[@checked]` therefore doesn't work either.\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\n\nCheck this out: https://jsfiddle.net/cw4hjLav/1/\n\nQuick copypasta from my browser console (I ran those right after loading the fiddle):\n\n```\ndocument.querySelector('input[type=checkbox]')\n<input type=​\"checkbox\">​\ndocument.querySelector('input[type=checkbox]:checked')\n<input type=​\"checkbox\">​\ndocument.querySelector('input[type=checkbox][checked]')\nnull\n```\n\nThe behaviour is the same with `defaultChecked`.\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n\nThe `checked` attribute actually is in the DOM whenever relevant.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\nTried this out with React 15 (the fiddle uses 15.0.1, my app uses 15.1.0), with both Firefox 47.0 and Chromium 50 on Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nI previously stumbled upon #3005 but didn't find the answer there, as my issue doesn't seem to be `preventDefault()`-related. Thanks a lot!\n",
