  "body": "As discussed on IRC, the lifecycle functions are misleading when using `renderComponentToString`. Namely, because `componentWillMount` is called, but `componentDidMount` is not.\n\nAt the least, this should be documented on the lifecycle docs page. There was also discussion about changing the method names. (Note: there's clearly a need for both hooks; the only issue is that name of the former conveys that the component will mount when, in fact, it won't.)\n\nOne possibility is to add another always-run phase before the mounting phase which is run when rendered to string or DOM (e.g. \"prepare\" or \"initialize\"). The lifecycle would then be easily explained as follows:\n1. Prepare the compoent\n2. Mount the component (if rendering to DOM)\n3. Render the component for the first time.\n\nI'd be happy to contribute a PR for either docs, method names, or both once a decision is reached.\n",
