  "body": "Rather minor issue, but the fix should be simple enough so I thought that I'd file this anyway:\n\nWhen using `react-addons-testutils`, sometimes I write simple errors such as \n\n```\nTestUtils.scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithClass(\"foo\")\n\n// expected:\nTestUtils.scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithClass(reactComponentInstance, \"foo\")\n\n```\n\nThis throws a stack trace of ~80 lines with a type error of `TypeError: Cannot read property 'split' of undefined`. Fixing this is trivial (and the first line of the stack trace points to the offending line as expected), but the error itself isn't really obvious. \n\nSome others such as `scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithTag` don't throw until `findAllInRenderedTree` is reached, which throws a bit more helpful error of `Error: findAllInRenderedTree(...): instance must be a composite component(â€¦)`. \n\nWould it make sense to check that the arguments passed are valid and throw immediately if they aren't, so the user would end up with errors along the lines of `scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithClass: first argument must be an instance of ReactComponent`?\n",
