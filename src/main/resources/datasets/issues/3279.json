  "body": "I would like to humbly request a componentDidReceiveProps hook, often times I would like to do something on both componentWillMount and componentWillReceiveProps, but because `this.props` hasn't been set yet I am forced to pass props around instead of reading directly from `this.props`.\n## Before New Hook\n\n``` javascript\ncomponentWillMount() {\n  this.setup(this.props.id);\n}\n\ncomponentWillReceiveProps(next) {\n  this.setup(next.id);\n}\n\nsetup(id) {\n  UserActions.load(id);\n}\n```\n## After New Hook\n\n``` javascript\ncomponentWillMount() {\n  this.setup();\n}\n\ncomponentDidReceiveProps() {\n  this.setup();\n}\n\nsetup() {\n  UserActions.load(this.props.id);\n}\n```\n\nIn this simple example it may seem like a small thing, but often times the passing of props runs deep and instead of conveniently referencing this.props one is forced to plumb the props throughout the component.\n\nPlease consider adding `componentDidReceiveProps` as a hook to leverage the same code that is leveraged in componentWillMount without forcing both to plumb props throughout the component.\n",
