  "body": "This has been a long standing bug for me with (only) FireFox that has been hard to track down, I'm still not able to reproduce it on-demand, but I am able to reproduce it by manual brute-force so I know it's there.\n\nThe short is that I'm using Flash with React and every now and then React would throw an invariant `ReactMount: Unexpected modification of 'data-reactid'` when calling `React.findDOMNode`. Debugging it however revealed that everything is as it should, but very rarely and temporarily the `object` node for some reason loses its `getAttribute` method (and more, probably) which causes React to return the empty string for the ID, crash.\n\nUpdating `internalGetID` like below actually works and no invariants or errors are ever observed.\n\n``` js\nfunction internalGetID(node) {\n  return node && node.nodeType === 1 && document.documentElement.getAttribute.call(node, ATTR_NAME) || '';\n  //return node && node.getAttribute && node.getAttribute(ATTR_NAME) || '';\n}\n```\n\nPersonally I've currently worked around this by just getting the DOM node on mount, it works well enough for me at the moment (and I don't update the object so it shouldn't surface during updates either).\n",
