  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug. Regression to be more concrete - https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/pull/1191\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nShow Source points to a Function Component body, and Class Component constructor.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIn both cases, you should see \"render\" methods, class constructor is never something you might want to jump straight into. It was working in this expected way in a previous version of Dev Tools.\r\n\r\n**Why this is an issue?**\r\n\r\nWell, until React-Hot-Loader is not 100% deprecated, \"Show Source\" would not work at all, as long as it (and not only it - `mobx` would do the same) is wrapping class constructor, however keeping `render` untouched.",
