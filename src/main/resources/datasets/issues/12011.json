The error message states \"Cannot create property for a non-extensible object\". It originates from the following location:\r\n\r\nFile \"react/packages/events/SyntheticEvent.js\"\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction addEventPoolingTo(EventConstructor) {\r\n  EventConstructor.eventPool = []; // Error: Cannot create property for a non-extensible object\r\n  EventConstructor.getPooled = getPooledEvent;\r\n  EventConstructor.release = releasePooledEvent;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nNo errors.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThe version number is react-dom 16.\r\nPossibly related to #11240",
