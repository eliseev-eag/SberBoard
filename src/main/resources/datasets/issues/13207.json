  "body": "\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nfeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI want to prevent my component from re-rendering  when some special props have changed because the performance is too bad on Android. But I find it is too difficult to make it prefect.\r\n\r\nI'v read the official document, it looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nshouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {\r\n    if (this.props.color !== nextProps.color) {\r\n      return true;\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nBut it is hard to negative comparison. \r\n\r\nThen I'v tried lodash, but failed ,too. Because the `isEqual` method in lodash can not compare DOM node while props.children is a DOM node.\r\n\r\nNow I have to change these special props to component instance method. Anyone can help me?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
