  "body": "Hi,  It is usually difficult to debug reactjs site. I have know how react and redux work, but there are many projects don't follow the official document, they write a bunch code to customize. That make a project difficult to understand(such as https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate).\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to know the whole working flow is follow debugging. But Chrome devtool doesn't play well with reactjs.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n1. breakpoint didn't hit\r\n    [![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n    `console.log('anno reducer',state)` did print `anno reducer State {_map: Map}` , but didn't hit any breakpoint. (Here I want to know where the error come from and find out why, not familiar that node package, so need debug.)\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Some lines can't not set breakpoint:\r\n    [![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Wrong scope:\r\n    [![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n    As you see, `action.type` is `CHANGE_LOCALE` now, but scope shows that `action` is `undefined`.\r\n\r\n\r\nI googled this but nothing helpful.I really want a working debug solution, that would help much.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/C7pyz.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/8fKgk.gif\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/PwUdr.png",
