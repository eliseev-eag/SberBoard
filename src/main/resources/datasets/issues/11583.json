  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nPage can't be rehydrated (but it's probably not a rehydration issue, the same happens when I use `render` on empty div instead). Console error:\r\n```\r\nUnable to set property `nextEffect` of undefined or null reference\r\n```\r\n(`childToDelete` seems to be equal `undefined` when I set breakpoint)\r\nPoint in source: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/4a924a206783df5d2e06755caa0fbd2dd580b14e/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactChildFiber.js#L243\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template for React 16: https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/, template for React 15: https://jsfiddle.net/hmbg7e9w/).**\r\nI can't isolate this bug to provide minimal demo or reliable reproduction steps without providing you the whole app. Spent a day already on this. Still trying to isolate the issue.\r\n\r\nWhen I removed most (randomly choosen) components and added `<div>hi</div>` to render of some deep component - it was fine, but when I defined `Div = () => <div>hi</div>` and rendered it instead with `<Div />` then I got the error. Restoring various components makes React crash on randomly looking points. Every refresh produces the same result though.\r\n\r\nI still report it in hope some dev got an idea what could be triggering it. I'll keep looking meanwhile.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nNo errors, page should be rendered.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16.0.0 & 16.1.1. Windows 7, IE 11.\r\nReact 15 was working just fine.\r\n\r\nThe same is happening with development and production build.",
