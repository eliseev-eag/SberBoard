  "body": "- Added some fixes from http://blog.christoffer.online/2015-06-10-six-things-i-learnt-about-ios-rubberband-overflow-scrolling/ for the overflow scrolling. Seems to work.\r\n- Subtle sidebar transition tweaks\r\n- Redesigned mobile sidebar toggle. Previously there was an issue where you'd have to tap it twice, as only Safari's toolbar would appear on the first tap. ![screen shot 2017-09-20 at 18 38 49](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24449/30658874-0b8a7c3c-9e34-11e7-9f3e-54001d0a9522.png). This caused a bit of yak shaving on the redesign, but I think it works just as well, if not better.\r\n\r\n@bvaughn \r\n",
