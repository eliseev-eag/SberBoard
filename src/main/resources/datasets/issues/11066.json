  "body": "Following up on #11063, it seems like the markdown engine that Gatsby uses encodes the query params in the markdown links. \r\n\r\nThis causes the query params of GitHub issues and PRs links to be double-encoded such that `https://github.com/facebook/react/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3Asemver-patch` becomes \r\n`https://github.com/facebook/react/pulls?q=is%253Aopen+is%253Apr+label%253Asemver-patch` and hence the links do not work. \r\n\r\nLeaving the links in the raw format of `https://github.com/facebook/react/pulls?q=is:open+is:pr+label:semver-patch` gets around this issue. Searched the whole code base for similar occurences and fixed all of them in this PR.\r\n\r\nTested on latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari.",
