  "body": "Calling React.render() from a script tag in the document head implies that React.render() is being called before the document body has been parsed by the browser.  This can lead to a confusing error, especially if the user is utilizing server-side rendering.\n\n> Error: Invariant Violation: findComponentRoot(..., .1ba6uva93i8.1.0.1): Unable to find element. This probably means the DOM was unexpectedly mutated (e.g., by the browser), usually due to forgetting a <tbody> when using tables, nesting tags like <form>, <p>, or <a>, or using non-SVG elements in an <svg> parent. Try inspecting the child nodes of the element with React ID ``.\n\nWe should probably warn if the user calls React.render() before the body exists.\n",
