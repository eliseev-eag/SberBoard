  "body": "Just wanted to write down some perf scenarios that I think might be important for incremental/Fiber.\r\n\r\n## Avoiding unscheduled work\r\n\r\nUnscheduled work is synchronous and can easily lead to dropped frames.\r\n\r\n- Any synchronous work.\r\n- setState in componentDidMount/Update causing synchronous work.\r\n- Life-cycles doing a lot of work rather than doing minimal work to schedule follow up work.\r\n- Event handlers doing all their processing in the handler rather than deferring to doing work in the component or rIC.\r\n\r\n## Starvation\r\n\r\nIf we hit the starvation deadline (expiration time) then something has gone wrong because we weren't able to do it in idle cycles. Some reasons can be:\r\n\r\n- Too much work is done in animations which leaves us too little time in idle. Might be React animations, other JS animations, CSS animations or even GIFs.\r\n- Too much work is done on the main thread and parallelism can be better utilized with a worker. E.g. for video processing etc.\r\n- High priority updates happen to high in the tree so we end up rerendering the whole tree.\r\n- There are not enough shouldComponentUpdate/PureComponents so that high priority updates don't bail out and cause the whole tree to rerender. High priority updates should touch only a small part of the tree.\r\n- There are not enough shouldComponentUpdate/PureComponents so that we can't reuse enough work safely when we resume a tree. Causing resumes to rerender everything.\r\n- Something is causing new trees to get dropped and not resumed. Probably because of a bad Fiber heuristic for when to keep a started tree and when to throw it away.\r\n",
