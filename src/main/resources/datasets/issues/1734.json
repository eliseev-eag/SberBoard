  "body": "It would be good to have `stopImmediatePropagation` support. My current use case is the following I have both a onClick and onTouchEnd event attached, on touch event supporting devices this will trigger the event handler twice.\n\n``` html\n<div onClick={this.handleTap} onTouchEnd={this.handleTap} />\n```\n\nIt's natively supported IE9+ and a simple polyfill will be easy for IE8 since react already has a synthetic event system.\n",
