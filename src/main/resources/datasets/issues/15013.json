  "body": "I screwed up a few months ago when I converted the Suspense placeholder tests to use test renderer instead of noop renderer â€” I forgot that we were using noop renderer because it supports both mutation and persistent mode. This PR corrects that mistake by converting them back to the noop renderer. This exposed bugs in our persistent implementation. (We don't use Suspense in persistent mode anywhere yet, but it's what Fabric will use.)\r\n\r\nThis indicates we should stop using test renderer for our internal React tests, and that we should probably be running all our tests in both modes by default. (I also found a bug related to profiler in persistent mode.) But I'll leave that for a follow up.",
