  "body": "We had written a context \"class\" that we planned to use with `withContext` but it turns out that `withContext` is implemented using `merge` which only copies \"own\" properties. I understand why this is desired other places, but is there any reason why `withContext` couldn't merge all properties?\n\nJust to be clear, here's an example of troublesome code:\n\n``` javascript\nReact.withContext(new MyContext(), function () {\n    ...\n});\n```\n",
