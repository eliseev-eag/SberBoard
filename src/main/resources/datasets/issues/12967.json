  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nRequest a feature. It would be lovely to allow for the second parameter of `ReactDOM.render()` to be a string like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, '#root');\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can try to implement it if it's a wanted feature. I estimate the bare basics can be done in 10-15 LoC, plus all the testing and documentation.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nYou need to specify the HTML Element as the second parameter of `ReactDOM.render()`, while there is a great API that would allow for a lot more flexibility and cleaner code. If you try to pass a string, the `Target container is not a DOM element.` error is thrown (as expected).\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe second parameter can accept a string, which would then be used with `querySelectorAll()` internally.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nAll of them so far.",
