  "body": "I am having a bug using wijmo 5.20182.500 with react. It appears that react is attempting to redraw a control when it has not changed. I have a TreeView control that when selected changes a state property and reveals some other controls on screen. The logic to render both the TreeView and the other content exists together in a single render call. It appears that even though the TreeView has not changed react is re-rendering it, because when I click on a TreeView checkbox the whole control blinks and resets all the checkboxes (which is the default state). I found some related posts, which all indicated wrapping the control in a div, but that has not worked for me. I've included a screenshot but basically what happens is that when checkedItemsChanged is called it updates state, which of course triggers render. However the TreeView control should not re-render but it does every time for some reason and I think that's at least part of reason for the error I included below (chrome browser). \r\n\r\n```js\r\ncheckedItemsChanged = (s, e) => {\r\n        const self = this;\r\n        const currentItem = this.reportsTreeView.selectedItem;\r\n\r\n        if (currentItem.report) {\r\n            if (currentItem.report === 'MarketingMaterials') {\r\n                const selectedReport = \"MarketingMaterial\";\r\n                self.setState({ selectedReport });\r\n            } else if (currentItem.report === 'DataPak') {\r\n                const selectedReport = \"DataPak\";\r\n                self.setState({ selectedReport });\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nrender() {\r\n        if (!this.props.user.id)\r\n            return null;\r\n\r\n        const reportsTreeViewItems = this.securetizeScreen();\r\n\r\n        let paramView = this.getParamView();\r\n\r\n        return (\r\n            <main className=\"container\">\r\n                <div className=\"row PageTitle\">\r\n                    <b>Select Report:</b>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n                <div className=\"row pm-form-container\">\r\n                    <div className=\"col-md-3\">\r\n                        <label className=\"dropdown-label label-inline pm-label pm-label-top\"></label>\r\n                        <div className=\"dropdown dropdown-left pm-treeview-container\">\r\n                            <TreeView\r\n                                initialized={this.reportsTreeViewInitialized}\r\n                                itemsSource={reportsTreeViewItems}\r\n                                displayMemberPath={'header'}\r\n                                childItemsPath={'items'}\r\n                                showCheckboxes={Boolean(true)}\r\n                                formatItem={this.formatItem}\r\n                                checkedItemsChanged={this.checkedItemsChanged}\r\n                                isCheckedChanged={this.itemChecked}\r\n                            />\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n\r\n                    {paramView}\r\n\r\n                </div>\r\n            </main>\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1474935/45365174-ef148500-b5a9-11e8-8d88-70992c9af0e1.png)\r\n\r\n",
