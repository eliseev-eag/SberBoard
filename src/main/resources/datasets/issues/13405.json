Before `componentDidMount` called, any changes will be ignored.\r\n\r\nIf I remount a component wrapped by `create-subscription` component, and do something in its `componentWillMount` which will modify the source value, I will get the wrong value in `componentDidMount` in the new component.\r\n\r\n```\r\nnewComp.constructor -> oldComp.cWU -> newComp.cDM\r\nstate = A              A -> B         A !!
