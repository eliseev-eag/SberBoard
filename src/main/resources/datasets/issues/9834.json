  "body": "I think a `React.Children.find` method would be really useful in situations where you need to iterate over your children and find just one that satisfies a particular condition. I'm running into this situation more and more often in my React code. A few examples:\r\n\r\n- In [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router), the `<Switch>` component [iterates over its children](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/c46e51bfd61343611ddbc173207952e980b81aec/packages/react-router/modules/Switch.js#L38-L49) to figure out which `<Route>` matches the URL.\r\n- In [a `<Select>` component we use in our training workshops](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-subjects/blob/44614bc3c6c8ca1de813e0bd1e14f86a74a5c0fb/subjects/Select/solution.js#L24-L37), we need to iterate over the `<Option>`s to figure out which label we should show in the select box.\r\n\r\nI wonder if there would be any interest from others in seeing something like this.",
