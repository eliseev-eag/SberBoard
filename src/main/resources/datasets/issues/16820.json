  "body": "We encountered an issue internally when using `findDOMNode` and the changes introduced in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/16807. Specifically, setting the fiber `sibling` field to `null` is problematic in that it runs into this invariant:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberTreeReflection.js#L213-L214\r\n\r\nWe traverse through the children of the fiber by going from fiber to fiber using `sibling`. Doing this, we encounter a child fiber that has been detatched earlier and thus has no sibling anymore, but the code for `findCurrentFiberUsingSlowPath` expects it should.\r\n\r\nWe need to revisit this, but for now, let's revert this specific change. I'll also try and make a repro when I get a chance and put in a follow up.",
