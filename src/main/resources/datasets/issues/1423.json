  "body": "Hello!\nI don't want to bother you to make any big changes or something like this, but I would like to know if you have any intention of something like what I'm doing.\n\nMy application has a router and when the route is ran, it gathers all the data that the views needs and then instance the views. Well, this is a little bad for bigger applications so my new design is:\n\nThe route just instance the view, the subview A will load the data that needs, subview B loads the data that needs.\n\nBut how I can do that when the componentWillMount is not called on the server? (Notice that the server and client uses the exact same routes and views. You can see a live example here http://playszone.com/)\n\nThanks for your understanding\n",
