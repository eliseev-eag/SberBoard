  "body": "ReactChildFiber contains lots of branches that do the same thing for different child types. We can unify them by having more child types be ReactElements. This requires that the `type` and `key` fields are sufficient to determine the identity of the child.\r\n\r\nThe main benefit is decreased file size, especially as we add more component types, like context providers and consumers.\r\n\r\nThis updates Call and Return components to use ReactElement. Portals are left alone for now because their identity includes the host instance.",
