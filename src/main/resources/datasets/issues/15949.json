Then click outside to loose focus and check the console, which will read something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrender \"\" false\r\n***EFFECT*** \r\nonChange \r\nrender a true\r\n***EFFECT*** \r\nonBlur \r\nrender a true\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would expect the effect to run after each completed render, i.e. also after the last render of the example above. Not sure if there would be any real use case, but I just came across this behavior and it seems to be a bit inconsistent (at least with the docs). So, IMHO either the last render call should not happen because neither props nor state changed, or the effect should be called after the final render.\r\n\r\n(Note: If you click into the input field and then outside again, there will be no additional render)\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact: v16.8.6\r\nBrowser: Google Chrome Version 74.0.3729.169 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\nOS: macOS Mojave\r\n\r\nI did not test this in previous versions of React\r\n\r\n",
