  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nComponents can only attach event listeners (eg onClick) to their descendent DOM elements. Is there a way for a component to listen to events originating from elements that are not descedents?\r\n\r\nThe use case I have in mind is, I have a bunch of components (marked out with pink borders in the screenshot below) that control their own state, and I want their state to change if a click happens anywhere in the purple region. I could solve this by moving the state up to the parent (the component that renders the purple div) but that seems to be a consequence of the fact that the event-listening tree is tied to the render tree, not that the components state actually interact at all.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/130362/25654804/0eeaf44c-3025-11e7-82af-377dffd71b7a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
