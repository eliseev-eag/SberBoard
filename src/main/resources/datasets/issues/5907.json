  "body": "Chrome treats anchor tags with an explicit `tabIndex='0'` different then if the attribute was not present. Specifically when clicking a link with an implicit tab index (i.e. no attribute on the node) no focus outline is shown. Whereas with an explicit tabindex='0' it does get shown. This is super minor, but maintaining react-bootstrap has taught me that A LOT of people are VERY touchy about browser focus outlines.\n\nIf anything this just makes the behavior consistent across browsers. (tested in recent FF, Chrome, and Edge)\n\nexample: https://jsfiddle.net/7kmck1f7/1/\n",
