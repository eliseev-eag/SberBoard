  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nI'm developing an extension for Firefox with React UI being injected into a website's content and I face a weird issue with events handling in React. I made a minimal project which can be used to reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n1. Use Firefox\r\n2. The code must be executed in an extension's sandbox\r\n3. Reproducable only on several websites (one example is below)\r\n\r\nThe steps:\r\n1. Clone the repository https://github.com/karataev/firefox-addon-react-events-issue\r\n2. Open Firefox and type about:debugging in url\r\n3. Click \"Load Temporary Add-on\"\r\n4. Open manifest.json in the src folder\r\n5. Navigate to the website https://www.ezibuy.com/shop/au/\r\n6. Open devtools, console\r\n7. Click with intervals on the CLICK ME window in the top left corner\r\n8. Notice that after some time \"Click from React\" stops logging, but \"Click from addEventListener\" logs all the time.\r\n\r\nHere's the screenshot.\r\n![firefox-react](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12277086/53738427-bf439b80-3ec1-11e9-931b-462f8facc999.jpg)\r\n\r\nOn first clicks both \"Click from React\" and \"Click from addEventListener\" are being logged. After some time there are only \"Click from addEventListener\" left.\r\nI guess it happens because of some website's code being broken or something. But the extension's code is executed in a separate sandbox and it shouldn't affect React events behavior, right? Why React events handlers stops executing, but native events work as expected?\r\n\r\nOne last note: this bug is reproducable in the extension only. The repo contains direct-injection.js file with almost the same code which can be executed right in the devtools console. And the bug is gone.\r\n\r\nI've spent half a day on this issue and I'm frustrated. Please, halp ðŸ˜«\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\"Click from React\" should always be logged.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nWindows 10, Firefox 65. React 16.",
