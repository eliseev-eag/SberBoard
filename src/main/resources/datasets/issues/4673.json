  "body": "The tutorial says to create a static JSON file in `public/comments.json`. However, in the tutorial repository this file is in the root directory. If you use the node server implementation from the repo and create the `comments.json` file in the `public/` directory, the server crashes when submitting a comment. Everything works fine when the file is in the root directory as it is in the tutorial repo.\n\nThe documentation for the location of the `comments.json` file should be consistent with what's in the repo so a user can just grab a server implementation from there and go.\n",
