  "body": "In terms of performance, is there any difference between using arrow functions and bind manually when using es6 classes? Using arrow functions the methods are not on the class prototype, it will be on the class instance only. Using bind will attach the methods to class prototype. It sounds like bind manually will have better performance, does that mean we should consider using bind instead of arrow functions for class methods? \r\n\r\nAny suggestions or comments are really appreciated!\r\n\r\nSo in terms of performance, would you recommend using\r\n```javascript\r\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  methodA = () => { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```javascript\r\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props)\r\n    this.methodA = this.methodA.bind(this)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  methodA() { ... }\r\n}\r\n```",
