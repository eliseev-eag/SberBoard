  "body": "Most of our test files only have one describe block with the name being the name of the file. This isn't useful and is only noise in the test files. It turns out that jest doesn't require it.\n\nI ran the following codemod https://github.com/cpojer/js-codemod/pull/54\n\n``` js\nfind `find . -name __tests__` | grep -v '__tests__$' | xargs ../js-codemod/node_modules/.bin/jscodeshift -t ../js-codemod/transforms/jest-remove-describe.js\n```\n\nAnd had to manually fix two files where backtick were not properly re-printed by recast.\n\nThis is working both on jest 12 and jest 15.\n",
