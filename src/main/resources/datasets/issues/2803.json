  "body": "The react implementation of `<select>` does not appear to allow an `<option disabled>` to be selected.  This is correct behavior in the user timeline, but not at initial creation.\n\nHTML allows for a `<select>` to offer a selected `<option disabled>` at creation time by [wording its disallow](http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#disabled) to only update a select to a disabled option, and disallows the form to post [if a disabled option is still selected](http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.2).  Whereas not explicitly allowing the pre-loaded `<select>` to select an `<option disable>`, all major browsers permit this.\n\nHTML does not allow a `<select>` to not have a selected option at any time.  As such, [it is idiomatic to have a disabled empty option](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8605516/default-select-option-as-blank) (or one with placeholder text such as \"pick a color\") be the selected element at load time.\n\nI believe that this example code should load to the first `<option>`, but instead it loads to the second.  If you remove `disabled` from the unshifted element, then (and only then) is it selected at load time.\n\n``` jsx\n/** @jsx React.DOM */\n\nvar TestCase = React.createClass({\n\n    render: function() {\n\n        var options = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,\"Eisenhower\"].map(function(X) {\n            return <option>{X.toString()}</option>;\n        });\n\n        options.unshift( <option value disabled selected> -- Select Eisenhower -- </option> );\n\n        return <select>{options}</select>;\n\n    }\n\n});\n```\n\nPlease advise.\n",
