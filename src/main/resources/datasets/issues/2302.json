  "body": "ReactLink supports a sort of adhoc two-way data binding. We've found it to be a distraction rather than helpful so we don't plan on adding it to the core outside of addons anyway.\n\nWe should take the support out of controlled components and make wrappers that can be used instead of the controlled components, and put the wrappers in addons. This provides backwards compatibility without having the legacy remain in core.\n",
