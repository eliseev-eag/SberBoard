  "body": "Currently upon setting state from a parent component and thus triggering a re-render of a `textarea`, the `textarea` always erroneously updates the DOM by removing and subsequently adding the `value` field in two separate updates, even if you don't change the `value` or `defaultValue` props handed to it.\r\n\r\nIt turned out `updateWrapper` was trying to simultaneously set both `value` and `defaultValue` to whatever your new `value` was, even if `defaultValue` was `undefined`. Removing the second part fixed this flashing behaviour by removing the unnecessary DOM updates.",
