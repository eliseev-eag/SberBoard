Right here when info was added and ready to be thrown. The mounting element was recognized with `$$$type` of `Symbol(react.element)` but `type` of `undefined`. Does it mean that it was recognized as a react component alright?\r\n\r\ninstantiateReactComponent (instantiateReactComponent.js?852a:70)\r\ninstantiateChild (ReactChildReconciler.js?dd13:44)\r\n(anonymous) (ReactChildReconciler.js?dd13:71)\r\ntraverseAllChildrenImpl (traverseAllChildren.js?8c0a:77)\r\ntraverseAllChildrenImpl (traverseAllChildren.js?8c0a:93)\r\n......\r\n\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\n\r\nI could not reproduce in jsfiddle coz it involves es6 module though.. \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nthe element recognized and mounted alright :)\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI have react 15.6.1, google chrome 58.0.3029.110 on os x.\r\nstrangely this only happens when built on linux. I have already ruled out any upper-lower-casing issue and tested `<b />` mounted alone working alright.\r\nHaven't tested w/ previous version of react.\r\n",
