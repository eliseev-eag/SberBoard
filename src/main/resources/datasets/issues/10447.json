  "body": "The prior message was a bit wordy and didn't cover all cases (like the one we discovered while researching #10441).\r\n\r\nWe can use the new URL to explain background info on the DEV-mode technique we're using _in addition to_ common fixes (eg `crossorigin` attribute for CDN scripts and Webpack `devtools` settings). Putting this information behind a link will allow us to more easily edit it in the future as common causes for this issue change.\r\n\r\nResolves #10441\r\n\r\n**Note** I have not yet setup the `fb.me/react-crossorigin-error` shortcut or written the content that will live there. It's been a long day and I'm taking off. Technically we can merge this at any time (to unblock the RC) and just follow-up with the link soon. Or I'll add it on Monday if we're not in a hurry. ðŸ˜„ ",
