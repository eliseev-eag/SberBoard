  "body": "A tiny, low-impact (basically non-breaking) change that I find makes a big difference to succinctness when rendering without JSX. I've added a minimal test, checked lint, and submitted the CLA.\n\nRender declaration trees tend to frequently include instances of `div` and `span` which only have `className` and nothing else, because they're purely structural and provide a way for CSS to inject styling.\n\nAlso with ES destructuring assignment, I can say:\n\n```\nvar { DOM: { div, span, p, input, button } } = React;\n```\n\nThis succinctly imports frequently used elements into the scope, and combined with this pull-request, allows me to write render functions like this:\n\n```\nrender() {\n  return div('container',\n           div('heading',\n             span('column1'),\n             span('column2')\n           ),\n           div('blah')\n         );\n}\n```\n\nThis makes it somewhat more succinct than JSX! :)\n\nThe prior code was written to assume that props is an object, so this change simply checks for a string and converts it to an object with a property `className`.\n\nRegarding static typing, no change is required to the `react.d.ts` file on DefinitelyTyped because all the properties of `HTMLAttributes` are optional, so `string` already conforms to it.\n\nFurthermore, designers of components could optionally support a `className` property in their props if they wanted to be able to accept a string in this way (which they could then interpret however they wished). Although the main purpose here is to make plain DOM elements more succinct.\n",
