  "body": "I'm going to close this issue immediately, since I don't have a reproducible\ntest case. We've hit this issue exactly once that I know of, but the code is so\nsimple that we suspect a React bug may be the cause. I'm hoping that documenting\nthis might help someone else who stumbles across it in the future.\n\n---\n\n**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\n\nReport a bug\n\n**Reduced code sample**\n\n``` javascript\nconst STATES = {\n  Alabama: 'AL',\n  Alaska: 'AK',\n  Arizona: 'AZ',\n  Arkansas: 'AR',\n  ... etc ...\n}\n\nclass extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <section>\n        {this.renderRegionFields()}\n      </section>\n    );\n  }\n\n  renderRegionFields() {\n    return (\n      <select>\n        <option disabled value=''>Country</option>\n        {Object.keys(STATES).map(this.renderRegionOptions.bind(this))}\n      </select>\n    );\n  }\n\n  renderRegionOptions(key) {\n    const abbreviation = STATES[key];\n\n    return (\n      <option\n        key={abbreviation}\n        value={abbreviation}\n      >\n        {abbreviation}\n      </option>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe're not referring to the `STATES` module anywhere else in the application (i.e. we're pretty certain it's not being mutated accidentally).\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n\nThe list of states is the list of two-letter state abbreviations in order (AL, AK, AZ...)\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\n\nThe list of states is being intermixed with some other unknown data. It ends up looking something like this:\n\n![](https://cloudup.com/cJpvH_6DJEI+)\n\nNotably, we don't have the strings \"BUT\", \"FROM\" (in all-caps) anywhere in our\ncodebase at all. Then again, it doesn't look like React does either...\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\nReact 15.1.0, Chrome 51.0.2704.103, OSX\n",
