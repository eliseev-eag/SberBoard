I saw that Babel [had an issue open](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/4959) adding a Tradeoffs.md I thought it would be great thing to add to the React repo as well. Maybe we want to move it to the docs directly but I thought i’d get something started, spur some conversation, and make this more of a community endeavor. \r\n\r\nI intentionally left the “pros” sparse for the time being  since I don’t think we’ll all have much trouble enumerating them :)",
