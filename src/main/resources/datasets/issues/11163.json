You get an error:\r\n```\r\nWarning: React does not recognize the `srcObject` prop on a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as lowercase `srcobject` instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent component, remove it from the DOM element.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template for React 16: https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/, template for React 15: https://jsfiddle.net/hmbg7e9w/).**\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn (\r\n      <video srcObject={this.props.stream}>\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is another issue that was closed but the issue was never resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/1474\r\n\r\nFirefox has deprecated using `URL.createObjectURL()` and Safari doesn't support it.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe ability to set the `srcObject` on a video element.  This is common for WebRTC applications now.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n\"react\": \"^16.0.0\"",
