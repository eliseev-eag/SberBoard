  "body": "It would be nice if the React docs had a good, concise explanation as to _why_ they decided to make props immutable. I have developer friends using angular who regularly make use of this technique (child mutates a data structure owned by parent) and think its great.\r\n\r\nThe docs do a great job explaining _that_ you can't do this and what the React way of dealing with this is (passing callbacks). But it would be nice to see some more tangible and specific examples of exactly what problem is solved by making props immutable.",
