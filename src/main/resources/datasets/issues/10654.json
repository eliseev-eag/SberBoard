  "body": "Add initial version of meta og tags to header using react-helmet\r\n\r\n**what is the change?:**\r\nAdds the same 'meta' tags from the old docs site to the new docs site.\r\nSome details;\r\n- some tags were the same for all docs pages afaik so I hard-coded those\r\n  into a reusable component\r\n- the 'og:url' tag is not quite right yet, but follow-up diffs can fix\r\n  it.\r\n- In the old docs each blog post had a description that was the first\r\n  paragraph. That seemed complex to do here - we have access to an\r\n  'excerpt' param in GraphQL and can set the truncation length, but\r\n  can't specify that we want the first paragraph.\r\n  Another option for the excerpt is to grab the HTML, get the first 'p'\r\n  element content, and sanitize it, but that seemed more complex.\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nWe want metadata - the delicious cream center of each webpage :)\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nManual testing\r\n\r\nThis is not quite finished so I didn't test super thoroughly\r\n\r\n**issue:**\r\nChecklist item from Gatsby wiki;\r\nhttps://github.com/bvaughn/react/wiki/Gatsby-check-list\r\nMisc > Make sure helmet title and metadata is working correctly",
