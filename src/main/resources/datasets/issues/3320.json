  "body": "I have a reusable component `Chart` which I decided to [put it up on GitHub](https://github.com/gsklee/react-chartist-tooltip/blob/master/react-chartist-tooltip.js). The weird thing is, although it's the exact same file, it works flawlessly while being part of my original project:\n\n``` javascript\nimport Chart from './chart';\n\n...\n\nrender() {\n  return <Chart />;\n}\n```\n\nBut it's not working at all once I pull it down as a node package:\n\n``` javascript\nimport Chart from 'react-chartist-tooltip';\n\n...\n\nrender() {\n  return <Chart />;\n}\n```\n\nThe error given is `Uncaught Error: Invariant Violation: addComponentAsRefTo(...): Only a ReactOwner can have refs. This usually means that you're trying to add a ref to a component that doesn't have an owner (that is, was not created inside of another component's`render`method). Try rendering this component inside of a new top-level component which will hold the ref.` but I am not sure if I understand it. Is this intended behavior?\n",
