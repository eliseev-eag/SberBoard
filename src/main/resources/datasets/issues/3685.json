  "body": "React was unable to reuse markup but not for the reason stated in the warning message. It seems that React determines a failed checksum, but when it actually tries to determine the part of the code that's different it takes into account such things as `checked` and `checked=\"\"` which actually do not cause a different checksum to be calculated.\n\nIf there is no easy way to find the real discrepancy, I think a better way to deal with this warning is to list all places in the markup where there might be a discrepancy instead of just listing the first place since it's likely not to be the actual problem.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2136203/7205789/68eb8618-e4f1-11e4-9352-f9835e0ad127.png)\n",
