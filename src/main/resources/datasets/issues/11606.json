  "body": "<!--\r\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\r\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nI would like to report a bug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen I use the `<input type=number />`, there is an issue with it displaying one additional decimal point. I noticed that the initial value in state is `1.2`, when I type in a `.` at the end of the input `1.2.` is displayed while the value in state still remains `1.2`.  When I type in another `.` at the end, the value disappears and returns an empty string instead.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template for React 16: https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/, template for React 15: https://jsfiddle.net/hmbg7e9w/).**\r\n\r\nDemo: https://www.webpackbin.com/bins/-KzQwHM22gvWWpedlwg0\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe expected behaviour is either that the input performs no built in validation or that the validation is restrictive enough to disallow the second dot, or if the validation cannot be modified, one must ensure that the second dot changes the value back to the value without the second dot.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThis has affected me in React versions: 15.3 and 15.4, I have not tried this in React 16. I have only tried this in Google Chrome v61 and have not tried this in any of the other browsers.\r\n",
