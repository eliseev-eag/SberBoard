  "body": "Hello React community,\r\n\r\nI'm getting myself familiar with React and I have a question that I would like to clarify about React component life cycle method.\r\n\r\nParticularly, I see that in all documents about React, when implement React component life cycle methods, for example, with render method, we use this syntax\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component{\r\n     render() {\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy question is: is there any problem or unknown side-effect if I change this method to use functional style method, as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component{\r\n     render = () => {\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope to receive your reply soon. I would like to appreciate in advance for detailed explanation about this issue.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
