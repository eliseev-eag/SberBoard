  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug. Inconsistent naming. Leads to poor user experience for developers.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nUsing PropTypes.function in the propTypes object for a React class produces a warning or error, \"Cannot read property 'isRequired' of undefined. You must use PropTypes.Func. \r\n\r\nEvery time I'm typing PropTypes, I have to look up whether it's 'func' or 'function,' and sometimes that makes me wonder if it's 'object' or 'obj' too. None of the other PropTypes names are truncated. This is a poor user experience.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\r\nMyReactClass.propTypes = {\r\n    someFunction: PropTypes.function.isRequired\r\n};\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe above works with no errors or warnings.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n15.4.2 and previous",
