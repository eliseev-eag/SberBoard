Also removes `on*` methods on hooks since in Fiber we call `validateProperties()` directly.\r\n\r\nAdds empty shims for methods RN still depends on. They are already no-ops, so now we just make this explicit (and add a TODO to remove the dependency). Isnâ€™t it nice to learn this before sync? Yay flat bundles.\r\n\r\n",
