  "body": "Jordan wanted an easy way to use React, and specifically behave nicely\nwith browserify. He has been using\nhttps://github.com/jordwalke/npm-react-core as a placeholder, but in\norder to keep doing that, it requires another build step and more places\nfor us to screw up. This just re-uses the NPM module we're already\nshipping and is really easy to update.\n\nNote: we may want to pull this out into it's own project eventually, but\nfor now... move fast?\n",
