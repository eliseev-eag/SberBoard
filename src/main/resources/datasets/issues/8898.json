  "body": "Probably lots of React apps depend on babel-runtime, perhaps directly or maybe indirectly. This can problematic, though, because it can cause such apps to depend on two versions of core-js:\r\n\r\n1. Your babel using React app -> babel-runtime ^6.22.0 -> [core-js ^2.4.0](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/2104ab6c44e807e50a799f010ba3e896f0c2e54d/packages/babel-runtime/package.json#L9)\r\n2. React -> [fbjs ^0.8.4](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/59aac010dd049719394c9cc4b70417302ce73c14/packages/react/package.json#L26) -> [core-js ^1.0.0](https://github.com/facebook/fbjs/blob/e13bb5721844bee2afa065321f260355d080bc3f/package.json#L63)\r\n\r\nThese two versions aren't semver compatible, so it means a project that depends on babel-runtime and also React will have two copies of core-js in use. A concrete example of this is a React app that [also depends on Relay](https://github.com/facebook/relay/blob/7d5e9165ede146c91b3f0b6583f28f6687289eeb/package.json#L32). There are probably many other such examples, though. It'd be nice to collapse this dependency into a single version of core-js.\r\n\r\nReact could bump its dependency to the latest fbjs which is [fbjs 0.9.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/facebook/fbjs/blob/master/packages/fbjs/package.json#L61). That's alpha right now, but it's been alpha for 7 months and probably you guys can arrange a stable release if you want to.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/facebook/fbjs/issues/217\r\n* https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/1421\r\n",
