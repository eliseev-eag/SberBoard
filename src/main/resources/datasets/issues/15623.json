  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nChild elements expressed as an array inside curly braces (eg: `{[<Element />, <Element />]}` are remounted when one sibling is added or removed beside the array.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nI came up with two examples. Their code is exactly the same, except that the first declares the elements directly in JSX and the second declares them inside an array (could be generated by `Array.map`):\r\n\r\n- [First example (works as expected)](https://jsfiddle.net/jvup1ek9/2/)\r\n- [Second example](https://jsfiddle.net/jvup1ek9/)\r\n\r\n`Ticker` is a generic component made up to demonstrate state. `DummyElement` is a generic component with no state whatsoever. `App` is the root component.\r\n\r\nIn the first example, you can see that, when switching between layouts, that is, when adding or removing the `DummyElement`, the `Tickers` states are preserved. This is the behavior that I would expect, given that the `Tickers` `key` props are kept the same.\r\n\r\nIn the second example, however, the `Ticker` state is reset whenever you switch between layouts. This is further shown in the console, that logs that the `Tickers` are being mounted and unmounted at each layout change.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe decision of mounting/remounting elements would be independent of  their siblings.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nLocally, I'm using React 16.8.6 on Firefox 66.0.5 on Windows 10.0.17134. Not sure which version JSFiddle uses.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA Stack Overflow question related to this (it was written by me): https://stackoverflow.com/q/56082557/7835318\r\n\r\nMay be related to Issue https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1493",
