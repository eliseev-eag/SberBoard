  "body": "This PR is prep work for a new 16 alpha release that (temporarily) re-adds getters with deprecation warnings for `React.PropTypes`, `React.checkPropTypes`, and `React.createClass`. I'm hoping to get this new alpha cherry picked into RN 44.\r\n\r\nI've broken this PR into multiple commits to make it easier to review:\r\n* 08bd020: Replace all references to `React.PropTypes` with `prop-types` to avoid triggering our own warning message.\r\n* ef5b5c6: Removed several references to `React.createClass` that appeared after rebasing this branch. (reviewed by @flarnie)\r\n* 524ce20: Added getters for `createClass` and `PropTypes` to the main `React` isomorphic object, behind one-time warning messages. (reviewed by @spicyj)\r\n* db48f54: Fixed Rollup bundles to inline 'prop-types' and 'create-react-class' for UMD builds only. (reviewed by @spicyj, @trueadm )\r\n* cf49cfd: Updated `tests-passing.txt` to remove tests that were deleted in this branch.\r\n* d34109a: Responses to PR feedback from @spicyj. (Added `package.json` dependencies to packages/react and packages/react-dom. Renamed a var. Expanded on an inline comment.)\r\n* 488c8d2: Added warning for moved package to `React.checkPropTypes` accessor too and updated build script.\r\n* 83bcb29: Wordsmithing for deprecation notices (added fb.me links).\r\n* afdc9d2: Tweaked legacy module inlining to remove order-of-deps constraint\r\n* d1348b9: Removed `$FlowFixMe`.\r\n* 7dbc3e7: More wordsmithing of deprecation notices based on Dan's feedback.",
