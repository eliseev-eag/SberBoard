  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nModern browsers no longer permit `Object.create(HTMLElement.prototype)` as a means of creating Web Components. See:\r\n\r\n> It's not possible to use custom elements without ES6 classes.\r\n\r\n- @domenic, https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/587#issuecomment-253993830\r\n\r\n[WebComponent demo](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/7dc5f91d886fcfd5bd9db40449370ce5d88ea188/examples/webcomponents/index.html#L39) uses this now-removed means of creating WebComponents.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\r\n\r\nRunning the linked webcomponent demo will throw an Uncaught TypeError. \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe demo executes & renders.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI'm not sure when this change went into force in browsers. Chrome m55 that I'm on is broken. m54 was broken.",
