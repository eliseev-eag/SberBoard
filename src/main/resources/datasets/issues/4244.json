  "body": "When trying to use [`React.findDOMNode`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/working-with-the-browser.html#refs-and-finddomnode) on a `props.children` item(`ReactElement`), an error is thrown.\n\n```\nUncaught Error: Invariant Violation: Element appears to be neither ReactComponent nor DOMNode\n```\n\n[Here is a small demo](https://jsfiddle.net/MadLittleMods/3fg7qLL7/1/) that shows off the problem.\n\n``` js\nReact.Children.forEach(this.props.children, (child) => {\n    console.log(React.findDOMNode(child));        \n});\n```\n\nThe parent component is mounted `console.log('isMounted', this.isMounted());` -> `isMounted true`.\n\n---\n\nRelated to #1602 and #1373.\n\n> Additionally the behavior of didMount and didUpdate handlers are currently undefined in regards to when they fire in relation to their children and therefore refs. For example componentDidUpdate is not guaranteed to fire after the children has fully mounted.\n> \n> [_From sebmarkbage, Source_](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1373#issuecomment-39811366)\n",
