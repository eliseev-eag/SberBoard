  "body": "To all the Facebook Engineers working on [open source](https://code.facebook.com/projects/),\r\n\r\nLike [last year](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8663#issue-198212596), we at [Reactiflux](http://www.reactiflux.com/) just wanted to take a moment to thank you for all your hard work in 2017. It’s been another big year! After much anticipation React 16 was [released](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2017/09/26/react-v16.0.html) in September, React Native has moved from v0.41 to v0.51 fixing countless bugs and adding new features, Jest has over 20 releases this year, Yarn 1.0 and Relay Modern were released, new engineers have joined (hey @calebmer, @TheSavior, @axemclion) and some have moved on (we’ll miss you @mkonicek), and that is just a tiny snapshot of 2017.\r\n\r\nTalking with some of you, I know that the dealing with the [licensing issues](https://code.facebook.com/posts/112130496157735/explaining-react-s-license/) this year was incredibly difficult and frustrating yet you all handled the situation in such a mature and humble manner all while continuing to iterate and innovate. Thank you! We are so happy that you can continue focusing on the work at hand, especially now that this chapter is finally [closed](https://code.facebook.com/posts/300798627056246/relicensing-react-jest-flow-and-immutable-js/). \r\n\r\nGuillermo Rauch recently [tweeted](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/944281445316550657), “As 2017 wraps up I believe more than ever that React is such a good idea that we will spend the rest of the decade continuing to explore its implications and applications.” We echo this sentiment and as 2017 wraps up, we also believe more than ever that you all embody the spirit of open source with such humility, servant leadership, and true focus on community driven progress that it continues to astound us. We thank you that these qualities are at the heart of our community. We thank you for all the time you have taken to join AMA’s and answer our questions on Twitter. For all the time you have taken to respond to issues and merge PR’s. Thank you for going above and beyond, again this year… as always. \r\n\r\nWe’d like to invite the React community to reply to this thread with your own “thank you” comments to the team at Facebook. Let’s show them how grateful we are! Feel free to include experiences with the team or just how the React ecosystem has helped you as a developer.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the Reactiflux community:\r\n@gabegreenberg\r\n@markerikson\r\n@KyleAMathews\r\n@taion\r\n@jquense\r\n@vcarl\r\n@benigeri\r\n@Phoenixmatrix\r\n@BTMPL\r\n@kyleshevlin\r\n@slightlytyler \r\n@totaldis \r\n",
