  "body": "Purpose:\r\n\r\nAs a developer, I would be really nice to easily identify whether a build failed due to external or internal reasons.\r\n\r\nInternal reasons are where we deliberately fail a build. \r\nAs I experimented with updating the Rollup version I experienced failures due to Rollup warnings.\r\n\r\nIn newer versions of Rollup they introduced \"CIRCULAR_DEPENDENCY\" warning which will fail the react-dom build.\r\n\r\nIf I knew the build fail was due to the build.js file explicitly invoking process.exit(1), then I would have spend less time debugging the reason of the build failure.\r\n",
