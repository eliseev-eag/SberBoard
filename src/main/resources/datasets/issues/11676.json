  "body": "I rewrote one of the two tests to use Public API, but I'm not sure about the other.\r\n\r\nThe test is supposed to verify that in case we have no event listeners attached, the events are not extracted. Isn't this decision taken internally by react though? And since they are not extracted in the first place how can you verify it without tapping into React internals? Any ideas or feedback are welcome.",
