(Unfortunately I can not provide a source of the app where I got this bug.)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nAn app built with Closure Compiler in advanced mode should not throw `this.deleteValueForProperty is not a function` exception\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact v15.4.2\r\n\r\nChanging `this.deleteValueForProperty` to `DOMPropertyOperations.deleteValueForProperty` solves this issue. There are other methods of `DOMPropertyOperations` object which are using `deleteValueForProperty` properly via `DOMPropertyOperations.deleteValueForProperty` call.\r\n\r\nIf this makes sense, I'll prepare a PR.\r\n",
