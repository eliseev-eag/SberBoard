  "body": "I ran into a strange behavior of useReducer. I tried implemeting my own redux and redux thunk for a small project. Here is a small replication of what I try to achieve. https://codesandbox.io/s/delicate-microservice-5qlt5 I do not have the bug here, but on my production build only. When I dispatch this action once, it get triggered three times. The third time, the payload becomes null instead of [] (empty array). \r\nI tried to find where the action/payload was changed and this is in the updateReducer. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25157915/64962655-14f8f780-d898-11e9-8f3c-bed07e0166de.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25157915/64962685-2510d700-d898-11e9-9fa1-3eaa9bdf3051.png)\r\n\r\nI don't have any clue of how this could happen since we juste get the action from the firstRenderPhaseUpdate object. \r\n\r\nTelle me if I missed something, I can give you more information.",
