  "body": "I think many people agree that the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: ... }}` api is gross even though there is great reasoning behind it.\n\nI have a few issues with it beyond it's verbosity that I think could be added as static method on the react class.\n#### My Issues with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`:\n\n1) Verbose and not always dangerous.\n2) Can't mix safe and unsafe html.\n3) Can't mix html with react elements.\n4) Have to manually concat html strings.\n\n---\n\nA better solution would be to provide a way to mark html as \"safe\".\n\n``` js\nvar React = require(\"react\");\n\n// Use #markSafe method to bypass reacts automatic html escaping.\nvar myReactEl = <div>{ React.markSafe(\"<br/>\") }</div>;\n```\n\nThis is still explicitly telling react that we trust the html but solves all of the problems above.\n\n``` js\n// Mixing safe and unsafe html.\n(\n    <div>\n        { React.markSafe(\"<br/>\") }\n        { \"<br/>\" }\n    </div>\n);\n\n// Mixing html with react elements.\n(\n    <div>\n        { React.markSafe(\"<br/>\") }\n        <span>Hello!</span>\n    </div>\n);\n\n// Multiple innerHTML sets.\n(\n    <div>\n        { React.markSafe(\"<br/>\") }\n        { React.markSafe(\"<hr/>\") }\n    </div>\n);\n```\n\nI think this api would be much friendlier than the current html api and probably wouldn't even require a major version bump.\n\nThoughts?\n",
