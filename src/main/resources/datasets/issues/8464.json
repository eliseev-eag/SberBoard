  "body": "Since `ReactTransitionGroup` uses a` for .. in` loop on `this.state.children`, it seems best to make sure that it is always looping an object. Currently, it can end up looping a non-object falsey value, which can cause errors (e.g. in my case, another library was extending the String prototype with enumerable properties).\r\n\r\nThere were two failing tests and 7 lint warnings on my system before and after making this change.\r\n",
