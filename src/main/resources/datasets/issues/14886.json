Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n1. I created an ap using create-react-app\r\n2. I use talkback for android, chrome browser, to access the app and use the swipe mechanism to navigate through the fields\r\n3. When headers and subheaders are in focus, talkback announces ‘double tap to activate’\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nTalkback should not announce ‘double tap to activate’ as the headers and sub headers can not be activated.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact:16.8.1\r\nOS: Oreo 8.1/pie 9\r\nBrowser: chrome\r\nDevice: Samsung edge",
