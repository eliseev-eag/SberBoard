  "body": "I had people on my team sending wrong arguments to oneOf and oneOfType attributes from PropTypes.\n\nThe current message exposed some internal attributes to the user with the following message:\n\n``` bash\nWarning: Failed propType: checker is not a function Check the render method of Chart.\n```\n\nThis warning is a little misleading, I had to spend some time trying to figure out who was invoking this **checker** function, unsuccessfully. Then, after some time, I realized the argument to oneOf and oneOfType was actually invalid and it had nothing to do with checker function.\n\nI've opened a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29995444/react-checker-is-not-a-function) case for this.\n\nThis pull request aims to fix this problem by validating the argument type as an array in both createUnionTypeChecker and createEnumTypeChecker. I've added the corresponding tests for this.\n\nAlan\n",
