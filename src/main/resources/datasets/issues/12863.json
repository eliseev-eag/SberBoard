  "body": "I tried removing `any` there and I noticed the types are a bit wrong.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, `findHostInstance*` reconciler methods return `Instance | TextInstance` rather than `PublicInstance` because they just give you the `stateNode`.\r\n\r\nHowever making that change uncovers that `findNodeHandle` can get a text instance (number in Native, object without a `canonical` field in Fabric). I'm not sure what to do with it; Flow fails.\r\n\r\n@sebmarkbage?",
