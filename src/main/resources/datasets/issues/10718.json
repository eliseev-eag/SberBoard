  "body": "In the first code snippet, this document says the preferred way of _ref_ callback is an inline function. Although the document comments side-effect by the inline callback is negligible at _Caveats_ section, at least it should not encourage users to make inline callbacks. So I turned all the inline _ref_ callbacks in the document into bound methods on the class. I believe this change makes document's stance regarding callback more consistent. (_Handling Events_ guide also discourages callbacks as inline functions)",
