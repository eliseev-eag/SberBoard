  "body": "This adds a warning for when components are mounted with lower case letters rather than uppercase convention used by react.\n\n> React's JSX uses the upper vs. lower case convention to distinguish between local component classes and HTML tags.\n> [Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)\n\nIt should however NOT throw warnings for valid components as stated in the #3596 issue dicussion.\n\nThe warning is only triggered on `__DEV__` environments. \n\nThe warning logic checks the following:\n- component being rendered is instanceof `HTMLUnknownElement`\n- component is not a \"whitelisted\"/supported html tag, like SVG, etc... which are instances of  `HTMLUnknownElement`, React actually already has a list of these supported tags so we just checked against it. `ReactDOMFactories.js`\n- component does not contain a hyphen or space character. Valid custom HTML elements must contain hyphen characters so we should not warn about it [(See spec)](https://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/#h-note2), also whitespace in component tag will throw its own error thanks to the \"sanitize tag\" tests/code already in react.\n\nLet me know if I missed something obvious. Thanks!\n",
