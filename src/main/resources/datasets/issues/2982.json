  "body": "The following is a snippet to demonstrate the use case I am trying to achieve. \n\n``` javascript\nvar Parent = React.createClass({\n  componentDidMount: function() {\n    React.Children.forEach(this.props.children, function(child) {\n      console.log('test' in child);\n    });\n  },\n\n  render: function() {\n    return <div>{this.props.children}</div>;\n  }\n});\n\nvar Child = React.createClass({\n  test: function() {\n    console.log('this is a test');\n  },\n\n  render: function() {\n    return <span>Child</span>;\n  }\n});\n\nReact.render(<Parent><Child/></Parent>, document.body);\n```\n\nLike you'd know, while iterating through `this.props.children` I am unable to get a reference to the actual component, or at least not able to figure out how so that I could access the child component's API.\n\nIs there anyway I could do this !? If not, why !?\n\nEdit: I am aware that I can add a ref to the child component and then use that to do this, but my goal is that the parent should not care about what it's children are or restrict / limit that in any way.\n",
