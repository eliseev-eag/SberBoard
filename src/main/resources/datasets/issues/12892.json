  "body": "> Looks like we're not catching functional components here. They can also have contextTypes and should also be warned about.\r\n\r\nAs is mentioned by @gaearon in the previous PR, functional components should also be warned if they have `contextTypes`. Previously it only warns in class components.\r\n\r\nTo reduce extraneous check, the logic is put into `mountIndeterminateComponent`.",
