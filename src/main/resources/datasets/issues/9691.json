  "body": "Currently, React Native has internal implementation details of how Fiber and Stack work in order to make the built-in React Native Inspector tool. This PR aims at adding an API to  ReactNativeRenderer so React Native can access the internals via an externally made public API. This API is DEV only, so should not affect file size in production.\r\n\r\nAn upstream React Native PR will follow too, adding support for React Native to use this new API.",
