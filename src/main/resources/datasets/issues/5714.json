  "body": "# Update: this was reverted in favor of a different approach in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6243.\r\n\r\n# If any attribute is missing please file an issue and we'll add it.\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nAll attributes defined on SVG elements will now be passed directly regardless of the whitelist.\r\nThe casing specified by user will be preserved, and `setAttribute()` will be used.\r\n\r\nIn the future we will remove support for the camel case aliases to the hyphenated attributes. For example, we currently map `strokeWidth` to `stroke-width` but this is now deprecated behind a warning. When we remove support for this, we can remove some of the code paths introduced in this commit.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this change is to stop maintaining a separate SVG property config.\r\nThe config still exists for two purposes:\r\n- Allow a migration path for deprecated camelcased versions of hyphenated SVG attributes\r\n- Track special namespaced attributes (they still require a whitelist)\r\n\r\nHowever it is no longer a blocker for using new non-namespaced SVG attributes, and users don't have to ask us to add them to the whitelist.\r\n\r\nFixes #1657\r\n\r\nReviewers: @spicyj @jimfb @sebmarkbage \r\n",
