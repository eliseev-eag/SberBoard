Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n```javascript\r\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\r\n  static sayHello() {\r\n     console.log('Hello')\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  static getDerivedStateFromProps() {\r\n     this.sayHello()\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI would expect the above to work. To me it is unexpected that a static method is not getting called on the class.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16.5.1\r\n\r\nThis seems like an easy fix to me, [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/a129259ad6a61790fe1912a87cb45018d942f90c/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberClassComponent.js#L161)\r\n\r\nIs there a reason not to change line 157 and 161?\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// From this\r\ngetDerivedStateFromProps.(nextProps, prevState);\r\n\r\n// To this?\r\ngetDerivedStateFromProps.call(ctor, nextProps, prevState);\r\n```\r\n",
