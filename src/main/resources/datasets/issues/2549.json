  "body": "If several children complete leaving before rendering TransitionGroup,\nonly the last one was removed. This could easily happen if\ncallback in componentWillLeave is called synchronously and several items\nare removed from array. The other case is when ReactCSSTransitionGroup\nhas transitionLeave={false} and array is also cleaned up.\n\nThe bug was happening because this.state.children was used as a base for\nchildren removal and it wasn't updated until the render, so only the last\nremoval was actually happening.\n\nFix involves keeping the updated children state between invocations of\n_handleDoneLeaving. After updating this.state and rendering,\nupdatedState is cleaned up and ready for subsequent array modifications.\n\nTest case included.\n",
