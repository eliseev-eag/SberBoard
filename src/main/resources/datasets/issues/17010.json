  "body": "The `performance.now` returns a timestamp in milliseconds as a float. The browser has the option to adjust the precision of the float, but it's usually more precise than a millisecond. However, this precision is lost when the timestamp is logged by the Scheduler profiler, because we store the numbers in an Int32Array.\r\n\r\nThis change multiplies the millisecond float value by 1000, giving us three more degrees of precision.",
