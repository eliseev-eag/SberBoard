  "body": "I’m deleting addons packages (and a few other abandoned packages) and “React with addons” UMD build on master. See https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9207 for rationale and the plan.\r\n\r\nWe will be releasing 15.5 with some updates to addons, and some deprecations (as explained in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9207) but we'll be cutting it from a branch since it diverged too much already. I’d like to delete them in master so that we can fork a copy in www for old code that still depends on them.\r\n\r\nNote this means that **15.5 release must be done manually and not with the release manager**.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [x] Fix tests to not depend on ReactFragment.\r\n- [x] Fix warnings to not mention createFragment.",
