There's a web app that I use that is built with React, which has made certain design decisions that I disagree with. The design is actually simple to change exactly the way I want by just opening the chrome devtools and changing the props assigned to a specific component. But I don't want to manually do this every time, that's not worth it. I want to write a (super hacky) personal script that automatically modifies the props being passed to this component. Wondering if anyone knows a simple hack for this.",
