  "body": "I want to request a ***feature*** or ask ***question***?\r\n\r\nI was faced with the dilemma of using two versions of React at the same time. This problem occurs when writing a large project-container (on the React 16), which within themselves can download the app-widgets (previously written that using an older version of React).\r\n\r\nCan I without changing old projects to put them to respond with the old version React and for new projects to put to React 16?\r\n\r\nFor example, webpack solution, something like this... (this example renames the old version to the new one, but I'm looking for the reverse solution)\r\n\r\n`module.exports = {`\r\n`    // ... other settings ...`\r\n` `\r\n`    resolve: {`\r\n`        alias: {`\r\n`            \"react\": __dirname + '/node_modules/react',`\r\n`            \"react/addons\": __dirname + '/node_modules/react/addons',`\r\n`        }`\r\n`    }`\r\n` `\r\n` `    // ... other settings ...\r\n`}`\r\n",
