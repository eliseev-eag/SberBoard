  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug (Out of date documentation)\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThe [current React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#profiling-components-with-the-chrome-performance-tab) talks about a flag `?react_perf`, however, since React 16 it appears this behavior is the new default in development builds. (And with shinier output! Yay!) [This pull request](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9071) seems to be where it became the new normal.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI would expect the first step suggesting to add ?react_perf gets deleted. I would also expect the screenshot to reflect the new and improved output, perhaps one of the screenshots from @gaearon'spull request linked above. \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16\r\n\r\nI am more than happy to make this pull request if my expectation is aligned with the projects. :-) ",
