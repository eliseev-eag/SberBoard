  "body": "If an error is thrown, and there is lower priority pending work, we retry at the lower priority. The lower priority work should expire at the same time at which the high priority work would have expired. Effectively, this increases the priority of the low priority work.\r\n\r\nSimple example: If an error is thrown during a synchronous render, and there's an async update, the async update should flush synchronously in case it's able to fix the error. I've added a unit test for this scenario.\r\n\r\nUser provided timeouts should have the same behavior, but I'll leave that for a future PR.",
