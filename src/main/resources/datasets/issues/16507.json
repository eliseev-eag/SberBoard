  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nIt is a bug in dev tools I believe.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhenever I go to specific page that uses react it shows me blank page. \r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I cannot provide steps to reproduce.\r\n\r\nWhen I set the React dev tools to load only when I click, then page loads. But when reloading the devtools, it shows blank again. Seems like renderer is being overridden and it is unable to show anything when devtools are loaded.\r\n\r\nIn the console I get error on row, but might be irrelevant:\r\n```\r\nwindow.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__ && Object.keys(window.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__._renderers).length && (window.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__._renderers = {});\r\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe page to load as it did with previous version.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nIt did work before Chrome restart, now Chrome 76.0.3809.100. Tried reinstalling React DevTools, so they should be the newest. Most likely before restart of Chrome extension was older version.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere might be code issue on webpage side, but dev tools should not cause blank page still. Maybe to show warning, but not break the page. Since I am not maintainer of the web site side code, then it is something I cannot change. Observation was that the Dev Tools is for some reason breaking the loading of page.\r\n",
