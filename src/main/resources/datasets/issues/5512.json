Inspired from the mobile nav of [Framer's docs](framerjs.com/docs/)\n2. Nav docs is hidden on mobile screens by default. Revealed by pressing a button.\n3. Footer text is center-aligned.\n\nYou can try the mobile friendly version of the docs site: http://yangshun.im/react/docs/getting-started.html.\n\nNote that this is still work in progress, wanted to get the opinions and suggestions of the team before I polish things up and test each page on various mobile devices. Suggestions and feedback are welcome!\n\n<img width=\"432\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-11-20 at 9 25 46 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1315101/11289521/c1536808-8f68-11e5-84ac-ed14e7cd1d1c.png\">\n",
