  "body": "Not sure who to tag for review, but this and adding the warnings for `React.createClass` should be the last two things blocking the 15.6RC. So anyone who wants to unblock by reviewing feel free~ ðŸš€\r\n\r\n**what is the change?:**\r\nUpdates the warnings for -\r\n - `React.createMixin` (was never implemented!)\r\n - `React.PropTypes`\r\n - `React.DOM.*`\r\n\r\n**I think we never added the warning for `React.createClass` to the 15.5 line**, unless I'm missing it, so\r\na follow-up PR will add that, with a link to docs etc.\r\n\r\nDoes *not* update the older warnings for -\r\n - Factory.type\r\n - 'isMounted' and 'replaceState'\r\n - ReactPerf\r\n\r\nWe could do a second pass if we want to improve those three warnings, but for now I don't think they are as hi-pri.\r\n\r\nStill TODO:\r\n - Do an initial release of the [`react-addons-dom-factories`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-dom-factories#react-addons-dom-factories) package on npm, making it 1.0.\r\n - Improve the docs for `react-addons-dom-factories` adding documentation and mention the [codemod](https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod/blob/master/transforms/React-DOM-to-react-dom-factories.js)\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\n - We want to make updating as easy as possible. Warning messages should increase clarity, and in the past they have caused confusion.\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\n`yarn test` and running these messages past some folks who use React.\r\n\r\n**issue:**\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9398",
