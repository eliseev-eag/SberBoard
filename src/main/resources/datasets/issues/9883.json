  "body": "I need to know if a Fiber bailed or not.\r\n\r\nI currently have a [comparison like this](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/blob/94206873bcfc2f131edcaf264a84706b9dc9d2a2/backend/attachRendererFiber.js#L40-L59) but it’s not exhaustive and doesn’t catch `shouldComponentUpdate` bailouts. This is especially bad because Fiber DevTools actually traverse the whole tree on every commit, so we need to be more aggressive about bailouts there than with Stack.\r\n\r\nI talked to @acdlite and we couldn't find any reliable way to deduce it from the structure (which would change anyway). Feel like an explicit hook is more appropriate.\r\n\r\nHaving this information should both help me avoid unnecessary traversal and updates in DevTools, and fix https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/issues/337 once and for all (which unfortunately makes the “trace update” feature pretty much useless).\r\n\r\nExample before (note how even bailed out AddTodo and other TodoItems are highlighted):\r\n\r\n![](https://d2ppvlu71ri8gs.cloudfront.net/items/1z3W2R0E1n2Q0X3B3h3r/Screen%20Recording%202017-06-07%20at%2005.26%20PM.gif?v=bea5092f)\r\n\r\nExample after (note how TodoList and one TodoItem are highlighted, others are skipped):\r\n\r\n![](https://d2ppvlu71ri8gs.cloudfront.net/items/3W3I312q273v2a461l0r/Screen%20Recording%202017-06-07%20at%2005.22%20PM.gif?v=aac71c5e)\r\n\r\nInternally, @emilsjolander is very interested in this for his project, and I'm sure we can find many people interested in www as well who gave up on this tool before (since it wasn't accurate).",
