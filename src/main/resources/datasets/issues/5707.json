  "body": "This PR lays the groundwork for [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) support to address #5704.\n\nThe required bit for Coveralls will be [setting up an account](https://coveralls.io/authorize/github).\nYou can add a \"secure\" token to the [travis.yml](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/.travis.yml).\n_(If you've recently upgraded to OSX El Capitan you may need to [reinstall Ruby](https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.11-el-capitan))_\n\n``` bash\ngem install travis\ncd react\ntravis encrypt COVERALLS_TOKEN=<token_specified_in_the_coveralls_setup>\n```\n\nThen add the generated secure string to another `- secure:` entry in the travis.yml.\n\nOnce the jest tests are run you can add a line to the travis.yml\n\n``` bash\ncat ./coverage/lcov.info | coveralls\n```\n\nThe Coveralls output will [look something like this](https://coveralls.io/builds/4524690).\n\nA neat thing about this PR is it also works in glob support for the \"collectCoverageOnlyFrom\" field and works when \"collectCoverage\" is `false` or removed. Ideally this would just be supported by [jest-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-cli) but until this it's p cool.\n\nRelated to #5703.\n",
