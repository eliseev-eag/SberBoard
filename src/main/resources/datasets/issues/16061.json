  "body": "I am extracting this feature request from #12906, which was already closed when the feature was requested, so was likely lost.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behaviour?**\r\n\r\nWhen `<React.StrictMode>` is used, some functions will be intentionally double-invoked such as the render method. This is fine, but can lead to confusion for developers months later, as they try to figure out why something is being called twice during debugging, etc.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behaviour?**\r\n\r\nFrom my comment on the other thread:\r\n\r\n> The problem is that if strict mode was added long ago, it is not obvious what the source of the double-render is (I was hunting react-router and redux logic).\r\n>\r\n> I think it would be nice if strict mode printed a console statement when used anywhere on the page and currently enabled (i.e. in dev mode), akin to the existing \"Download the React DevTools for a better development experience: https://fb.me/react-devtools\" advert.\r\n>\r\n> Something like \"Strict mode is enabled; some lifecycle methods including constructors and render will be double-invoked to check for side-effects\"\r\n\r\nThe suggestion received some support on the original issue, and I think adding this feature would save developer time and confusion when working on codebases which have enabled strict mode during development.",
