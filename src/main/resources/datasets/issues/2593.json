  "body": "ART, just like MultiChild adds an expando property to manage it's diffing\nstate. This is ugly and bad. We should be moving this state outside the\ncomponent for use by the diffing algorithm. This state is not needed by\ncomponents nested in composites, and varies by diffing algorithm.\n\nIt sucks that I have to add it to every component just to support ART,\nbut that's the quickest solution, other than disabling preventExtensions.\n\nAt least now we know that it sucks.\n",
