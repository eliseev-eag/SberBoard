  "body": "We have a few use cases that we support which shouldn't rely on `document` or other DOM specific globals to be available.\n- Shallow Rendering\n- Worker Renderers (e.g. react-native like environments)\n- Server Rendering (setState etc shouldn't look for document)\n\nUnfortunately we often screw this up. Which leads to work arounds:\n- https://github.com/gaearon/library-boilerplate/pull/6\n- https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/JavaScriptAppEngine/polyfills/document.js#L28\n- https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3620\n\nPart of the problem is that jest comes with JSDOM always on. We need to have a test environment that allow us to execute in a DOM-less environment.\n\nWe also need to add separate unit tests for these three test cases that execute in a DOM-less environment.\n\nWe could potentially add a lint rule against using globals in files in the `shared` folder.\n\nWe should also get rid of all uses of `canUseDOM` since it varies by render tree, not environment.\n",
