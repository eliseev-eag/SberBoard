  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?** Bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nexhaustive-deps does not play well with 3rd party hooks like useBoolean that return objects instead of arrays because they work better when not destructured.\r\n\r\nFor example in the following:\r\n```js\r\nimport { useCallback } from 'react';\r\nimport { useBoolean, useInput } from 'react-hanger';\r\n// ...\r\n  const pending = useBoolean(false);\r\n  const email = useInput();\r\n  const submit = useCallback(() => {\r\n    pending.setTrue();\r\n    Promise.resolve()\r\n      .then(() => console.log(email.value))\r\n      .then(pending.setFalse);\r\n  }, [email.value, pending.setTrue, pending.setFalse]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nexhaustive-deps complains with `React Hook useCallback has a missing dependency: 'pending'. Either include it or remove the dependency array`.\r\n\r\nHowever this is a bad idea, since `pending` will change every time that `pending.value` changes resulting in the `submit` event handler changing each time. Despite the fact that it only uses `pending.setFalse` and `pending.setTrue` which are static and already included in the deps array. Destructuring `pending` would also \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nexhaustive-deps should not complain because the exact deps are already present in the deps array.\r\n",
