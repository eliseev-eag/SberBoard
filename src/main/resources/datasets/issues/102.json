  "body": "The biggest improvement is that we'll now insert each parsed JSX script\nback into a `<script>` tag with the body set. This allows the browser to\nexecute these scripts normally. Using `Function(functionBody)` or\n`eval(functionBody)` both execute in window scope, but `var` assignments\ndon't actually get set on window (unlike everywhere else).\n\nI also did some cleanup to make the code a little bit more readable.\nIn my minimal test cases this didn't break anything (scripts loaded in\nthe right order).\n",
