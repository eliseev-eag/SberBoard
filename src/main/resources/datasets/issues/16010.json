Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/elated-butterfly-r2jpe\r\n\r\nIn the above example, I am not able to use the `env variables` in the `index.html` and `callback.html`. This is different from CRA in which, I can at least access the `env variables` in the `index.html`.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe title of `callback.html` should be changed according to the `REACT_APP_CALLBACK_TITLE` in the `.env` file.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nreact -> 16.8.6\r\nreact-dom -> 16.8.6\r\nreact-scripts -> 3. 0.1\r\nbrowser: Google Chrome -> Version 75.0.3770.100 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\nNope, it didn't work in previous versions of React.",
