  "body": "I came up with a rather crude (but I think promising) way to autogen component rendering tests. I'm throwing a big list of values at my components' propTypes validators (kind of like using a fuzzer). I use that to construct a set of supposedly-valid values for each prop, and subsequently combine those into supposedly-valid sets of props.\n\nWith direct calling of prop validators being deprecated, is there some other way to accomplish this that I'm missing? I think this test generator would be really useful, but given that I'm dependent on a deprecated feature, I'm not clear if it has a future.\n\nfiddle demo: https://jsfiddle.net/6g3r6amb/1/\n",
