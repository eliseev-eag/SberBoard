  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nThis is a feature request.\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\nThere doesn't appear to be a way to pass context when calling `renderer.create`\n\nI'm attempting to use snapshot testing in Jest with a component that uses `react-intl`. If I could provide context, I could create a similar [helper function to those for enzyme](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/wiki/Testing-with-React-Intl#helper-function-1).\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nBe able to provide a context, similar to `shallowRenderer.render`: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3721\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n\nI'm using React 15.13.2 and haven't tried any previous versions of React.\n",
