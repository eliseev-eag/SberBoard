  "body": "The idea for this pull request came up when @trueadm and I were talking about being able to differentiate between focusable and tabbable elements (to implement something like roving tabindex for focus management as recommended within aria best practices guide: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#kbd_roving_tabindex).\r\n\r\nThe current `getFocusableElementsInScope` implementation treats elements with `tabIndex === -1` as not focusable. This introduces as boolean flag (`includeNegativeTabIndex`) that disables the `tabIndex < 0` filter. Also made the logic more generic to accommodate for `tabIndex` values other than `-1` and `0`. And I added some tests :)",
