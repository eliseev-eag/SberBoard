  "body": "I believe this is a bug and potentially related to https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3298, but the specific details are different enough that I wanted to file a separate issue. Feel free to close if it's the same root cause.\n\nI have a repro here: https://jsfiddle.net/7s6mwccu/2/\n- ClickMe is a component that runs `causeError` on click\n- `causeError` first renders components of type A and B (let's call them A0 and B0)\n- B0 has a componentDidMount function that calls setState (comes into play later)\n- `causeError` then updates A0 with a new prop\n- A.componentDidUpdate unmounts B0 and mounts a new B, B1\n- After `causeError` is all done, React's runtime performs some ops (presumably due to B0's setState) that leads to:\n\n> Warning: React can't find the root component node for data-reactid value `.2`. If you're seeing this message, it probably means that you've loaded two copies of React on the page. At this time, only a single copy of React can be loaded at a time.\n> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'firstChild' of undefined\n\nPeeking at the stacktrace, it looks like `didPutListener` is trying to findDOMNode on an already-unmounted component.\n\nSome weird details:\n- Leaving off onClick removes this error\n- Not calling setState in B.componentDidMount also removes this error\n\nSo it's a bit different from #3298 because it's not erroring if we only unmount B during a click; it's erroring if we have onClick and setState.\n\nThis is on React 0.14 - I tested it briefly on React 15 and got\n\n> Invariant Violation: React DOM tree root should always have a node reference.\n\nwhich presumably is a better formed version of the same error.\n",
