  "body": "Hey folks,\n\nHere at [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) we do use React on some of our projects internally and found that searching the React documentation could be improved. So I was considering sending you a PR which adds such search to your documentation.\n\nI saw that the website is using Jekyll, and we do actually have a [Jekyll plugin](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-jekyll). If you don't known Algolia, we're a SaaS provider, offering an hosted search engine, accessible through a REST API. Pushing data to our API will be as easy as `jekyll algolia push`.\n\nYou can see a live demo of a similar (currently pending) PR on the [Bootstrap documentation here](https://bootstrap.algolia.com/). We've already provided such free accounts to other popular open-source projects that we love and use ([Laravel](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1), [HackerNews](https://hn.algolia.com/?query=rubygems&sort=byPopularity&prefix&page=0&dateRange=all&type=story), [FontAwesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) or [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/) for example).\n\nI just wanted to check with you first if that is something you would be interested for the React documentation before I start coding anything. If so, I'll start hacking something and if you like it, we could then move forward together. We would of course give you full access to your unlimited free account (we only ask for a small \"powered by Algolia\" logo).\n\nJust hit reply if you have any questions, I'd be really happy to make this happen.\n",
