Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nPlease find the example copied from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) (the first HTML example): https://codesandbox.io/s/8z5wyo2.\r\nOpen browser's console and run it. In the console you will see warning: `validateDOMNesting(...): <tr> cannot appear as a child of <table>. Add a <tbody> to your code to match the DOM tree generated by the browser.`\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nAccording to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) `table` could have `tr` as a child (there are such examples on their pages [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) and [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr)), so I'd expect that warning does not appear\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThe issue is found in v16.x.x in Chrome / FF. It may affect other browsers and prior versions",
