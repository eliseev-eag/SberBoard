  "body": "I'm trying to use the addon in a layout component with react and react-dom as peer dependencies, but if I include it my build goes from 55k to 750k.\r\n\r\nThe published npm module is simply this line of code:\r\n`module.exports = require('react/lib/ReactTransitionGroup');`\r\n\r\nIf I look at react/lib/ReactTransitionGroup, I see this line\r\n`var React = require('./React');`\r\n\r\nWhich causes webpack to pull in all of react, since I only defined `'react'` as an external module\r\n\r\nI could make 'react-addons-css-transition-group' external to my webpack build, but there's no distributed script for just that addon that adds it to the window variable (similar to how including the `react` script adds `window.React` and `react-dom` adds `window.ReactDOM`)\r\n\r\nThe `timeout-transition-group` module depends on `react-addons-css-transition-group` so it has the same problem\r\n",
