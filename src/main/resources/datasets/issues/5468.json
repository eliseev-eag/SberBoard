  "body": "Right now we validate some of our proptype definitions, but we don't surface the issue until that component class is consumed. We should instead validate these, in `__DEV__` only as warnings when the class in created. This means that a call to `React.PropTypes.onOf('foo')` results in an immediate warning logged.\n\nThis is a relatively contained bit of code so would be a good candidate for somebody looking to start contributing to React.\n",
