  "body": "Fixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11789.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, non-string `dangerousInnerHTML.__html` is now handled during hydration the same way as we handle it during a pure client-only or server-only render. Specifically, we coerce any value `__html` value that isn't `null` or `undefined` to a string. Previously, hydration behaved inconsistently.\r\n\r\nThese are the same tests run against on master:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1260\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-08-09 at 5 54 52 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/43913592-64245a08-9bfd-11e8-8c10-f7dda763ca40.png\">\r\n\r\nYou can see that the only ones that were failing are related to hydration. This tells us that the PR doesn't change the behavior for purely client-only or server-only renders, but it fixes the inconsistency when hydrating on top of good markup.",
