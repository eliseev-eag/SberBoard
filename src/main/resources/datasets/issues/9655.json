  "body": "I get the unknown prop warning:\r\n\"Warning: Unknown prop `onResize` on <object> tag.\"\r\n\r\nBut, as best I can tell, this is actually something that should be expected to work, since browsers support it (on <object>). I also found a post from someone discussing this behavior:\r\nhttp://www.backalleycoder.com/2013/03/18/cross-browser-event-based-element-resize-detection/\r\n\r\nI looked at the HTML5 spec, and after a cursory glance it apparently tells me it might actually be supported on many more elements. (But it also tells me the event is a bit complicated.)\r\n\r\nSo, should this work, or should this not work? I'm not looking for a workaround, but if this is indeed a bug as I expect, I would rather fix it than work around it.",
