  "body": "Known issues:\r\n\r\n* Passing `nextContext` to `componentDidUpdate()` would require changing the approach and adding a field to Fiber. For now we decided to bail on supporting this use case (e.g. Facebook doesn't have a single component in thousands using this pattern). We'll probably make a breaking change in Stack as well for this in 16.\r\n* Deep updates blocked by sCU still don't work: this is about feature parity.\r\n* It might be broken with error boundaries. I will address this in later PRs.",
