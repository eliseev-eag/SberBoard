  "body": "I dislike the current way the blogs page is setup. When I click on blog, I want to see some blog posts, not being redirected on a page that only has previews of the articles. If I'm presented a choice of ten things to click on, I'm going to click on 1 or 2. It's best to show the content directly on this page. I can just scroll to see more. If I'm really interested in one article in particular, there's always the listing on the left column.\n",
