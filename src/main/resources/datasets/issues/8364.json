  "body": "Fixes the ReactComponentWithPureRenderMixin test by shallow cloning the component's initial state. Prior to this commit, the test was modifying a property on the state object passed into `setState`. This had the side-effect of also modifying the component's state, since the object was shared.\r\n\r\nThe alternative here was to update the test; I wasn't sure of the overhead of a shallow clone was forgivable. But at the very least, this diagnosis the issue and proposes a fix.",
