  "body": "I have a situation where I simultaneously render multiple instances of the same component. During componentWillMount a check is made against one of the props passed to the component and an event may be raised that causes other components to update their state like in this example:\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/rTv4n/\n\nThe problem seems to be that if one of the components' render method was called but the component has not yet been mounted and then you call setState, it throws this exception:\n\nUncaught Error: Invariant Violation: findComponentRoot(..., .0.$child1): Unable to find element. This probably means the DOM was unexpectedly mutated (e.g., by the browser). Try inspecting the child nodes of the element with React ID ``. react.js:15374\n",
