  "body": "Currently when hydrating server-rendered markup we ignore changes the user makes before hydration. We also don't reset their changes once hydration finishes. The motivation there was likely to avoid losing user input. See this test:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-dom/src/__tests__/ReactDOMServerIntegrationForms-test.js#L543-L552\r\n\r\nThe problem with that is that it assumes the value will continue to be changed after hydration completes (e.g., a user keeps typing). If they _don't_, then the DOM and React will be out of sync.\r\n\r\nWe should try to detect if there have been any changes made to an input when hydrating, and if so dispatch a change event so that the component is notified of the new value.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12939 for some more discussion.\r\n",
