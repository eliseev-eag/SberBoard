  "body": "Hi React team,\r\n\r\nI am the creator of NPM's `server` [(Website)](https://serverjs.io/). The main goal of the library is to simplify Node.js development, think of it as a modern `express` with all the middleware included by default and ES7 full-on.\r\n\r\nThere will be plugins soon, and I want one of the first ones to be based on React. I like the simplicity of `create-react-app` so I want to make a plugin with a similar functionality, but without needing a CLI. Something like this for getting started:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install server @server/react\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Load the main library. All installed plugins will be automatically loaded\r\nconst server = require('server');\r\nconst { render } = server.reply;\r\n\r\n// Will render any request using 'App.jsx'\r\nserver(ctx => render('App.jsx', { user: 'Francisco' }));\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// App.js\r\nexports default (props) => {\r\n  <div>\r\n    <h1>Hello { props.user }!</h1>\r\n    React code goes here as normal ...\r\n  </div>\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen just running `npm start`, without any other library should make React work with `server`. I have a local proof of concept with `sass` that works great, and I want to implement React now.\r\n\r\nI am implementing a first proof of concept today ([during this event in Tokyo](https://www.meetup.com/React-Hack-Tokyo/events/242980328/)), but I have few questions:\r\n- What do you think? Do you think users might find it easy to use in a similarly to `create-react-app`?\r\n- I would like to invite any React dev who is interested. You can do as much (or as little) as you want, from just keeping tabs on it to actively helping me develop this plugin. Is anyone interested?",
