Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nYou can test the issue at [https://github.com/CongoCash/react-router-testing](url).  First run it with 'npm start' and navigate to http://localhost:3000/test.html?test=5. Then run 'npm run build', followed by 'serve -s build' and navigate to http://localhost:5000/test.html?test=5\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nWhen you run react-scripts start and navigate to http://localhost:3000/test.html?test=5, it will correctly navigate to http://localhost:3000/test.html?test=5.  Upon running react-scripts build and serving the build, navigating to http://localhost:5000/test.html?test=5 will result in a redirect to http://localhost:5000/test with a status code of 301 Moved Permanently.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThis occurs in version 16.10.0 and is affected in Chrome, Safari, Firefox.\r\n",
