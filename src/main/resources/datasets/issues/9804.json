  "body": "Hello\r\n\r\nI have a react application running in our local intranet.\r\nAll our apps run behind a web proxy with a Basic Authentication, user/password checked against our AD server.\r\n\r\nWhen accessing my react app directly, or via unauthenticated proxy, everything works fine.\r\n\r\nWhen I access the app with the proxy authentication enabled, I manage to fetch the very first page, but every other request performed using 'fetch' fails with a 401 Unauthorized.\r\n\r\nBasically the Authorization Header with the hashed credentials is not passed to the fetch request, while it works seamlessly for any other <script> or <css> request.\r\n\r\nI looked on the internet for a workaround, but I couldn't find anything other than hardcoding the Authorization Header in the fetch request, which is really not a feasible solution. Nor is implementing specific login logic to work around the proxy issue.\r\n\r\nCould you please advise?",
