  "body": "`yarn build` worked but `yarn build -- --type=FB` failed.\r\n\r\nI tracked it down to a mutation in the bundle config. Since NODE builds ran just before FB, the newly added `object-assign` external was already there and `yarn build` worked even though it was still missing in FB configuration.\r\n\r\nThis deep freezes the config, removes the mutation, and explicitly adds `object-assign` as an external for FB builds. (We’ll need to set up an internal www `node_modules/object-assign` shim that just points it at our `Object.assign` polyfill or even `Object.assign` itself since our polyfill is global.)\r\n\r\nI want to note that technically that `object-assign` import ends up unused in the FB bundle. It was a hack to remove UMD duplication. But it doesn’t harm to keep it IMO. Better than forking the entry point again.",
