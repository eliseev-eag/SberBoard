  "body": "We want to be able to track various things like number of files that are flowified, number of tests passing with Fiber...\n\nThis introduces a tool that lets you do that. The API is very simple, you execute the script with a list of tuples [key value] and it's going to create a `facts` branch and put a txt file for each fact and values over time.\n\n```\nnode scripts/facts-tracker/index.js \\\n  \"flow-files\" \"$COUNT_WITH_FLOW/$COUNT_ALL_FILES\"\n```\n\nTest Plan:\nThis is tricky to test because Travis only exposes the private variables (github token) when it processes a committed file and not on branches. The reason is that otherwise anyone could send a pull requests that does `echo $GITHUB_TOKEN` and steal your token.\n\nGiven this constraint, I did all the work using two of my repos:\n- https://github.com/vjeux/facts-tracker\n- https://github.com/vjeux/facts-tracker-test\n\nand am sending this pull request that should work as is /fingers crossed/, but we won't be able to test it out until it is committed.\n\nNote that once this lands, I'm going to kill those two repos.\n",
