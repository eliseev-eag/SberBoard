  "body": "# If the state is an array of object, it seems cannot listen the state updating when I modify any object\r\n\r\n> It may be my fault, but the issue seems exist. \r\n\r\n### Version\r\n16.8.6\r\n\r\n### Related\r\n[React useState Hook don't rerender the changes #15595](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/15595)\r\n\r\n### Situation\r\n1. I used `useState` to create a state which is an array of object.\r\n2. I used the either function below to update state:\r\n    ``` jsx\r\n     const onChangeData = (key, value, id) => {\r\n      state.forEach((a, i) => {\r\n        if (a.id === id) {\r\n           state.splice(i, 1, { ...a, [key]: value });\r\n         }\r\n      });\r\n      setState(state);\r\n     };\r\n    ```\r\n    ``` jsx\r\n     const onChangeData = (key, value, id) => {\r\n      const temp = data;\r\n      temp.forEach((a, i) => {\r\n        if (a.id === id) {\r\n           temp.splice(i, 1, { ...a, [key]: value });\r\n         }\r\n      });\r\n      setState(temp);\r\n     };\r\n    ```\r\n3. I used `useEffect` to listen the state updating and do something, but it doesn't work: \r\n    ```jsx\r\n     useEffect(()=>{\r\n        // do something\r\n     }, [state]);\r\n    ```\r\n4. I modified the function above, and it works:\r\n    ```jsx\r\n     const onChangeData = (key, value, id) => {\r\n      let temp = [];\r\n      temp = temp.concat(state);\r\n      temp.forEach((a, i) => {\r\n        if (a.id === id) {\r\n           temp.splice(i, 1, { ...a, [key]: value });\r\n         }\r\n      });\r\n      setState(temp);\r\n     };\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n###  Possible reason \r\nSo I guess React checks the first layer of the array state only (own properties? ), or checks the memory stack of the state only, no deeper comparing. (Just my guess)\r\n\r\n### Expect\r\nI am not sure the reason of the issue, maybe it is my fault, maybe it is a solution for the performance. I hope that someone can tell me the real reason, and how to use it exactly. \r\n\r\n### At last\r\nThanks in advance for anybody who answers me!",
