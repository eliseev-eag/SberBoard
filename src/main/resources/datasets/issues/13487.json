  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nQuestion\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI am trying to use `react-test-renderer` and I notice that the lifecycles methods (ex: `componentDidMount`) need to be fired manually - `rendered.getInstance().componentDidMount()`, what solves my problem but reveals an other: I want to use shallow render, to test only the component under test, but then `react-test-renderer/shallow` API is minimal for rendering.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI was expecting that `react-test-renderer` would support testing my component reaction to the different lifecycles and be capable to use `shallow` rendering. Is there some way to use `react-test-renderer` in this scenario? Or is better I move to another library like `enzyme`?\r\n",
