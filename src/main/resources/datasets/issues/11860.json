  "body": "An interactive update is the result of a user interaction. They have higher priority than default, non interactive updates (like server events).\r\n\r\nWhat's special about interactive updates in async mode is that one interactive update may affect the behavior of a subsequent one. For example, a \"Submit\" button on a form field that disables itself once it's clicked. If the user clicks it twice, but the first update hasn't flushed by the time the second click occurs, the form will submit twice because we haven't updated the event handler yet.\r\n\r\nThe behavior we want is for the final result of a series of interactive updates to be deterministic.\r\n\r\nThe solution I've used here is to detect when an interactive update is scheduled while another one is in flight. In that case, the first one is synchronously flushed. This must happen *before* any event handlers are called.\r\n\r\nI've added tests to prove this works with ReactNoop. Still need to add it to ReactDOM.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Wrap all appropriate events in ReactDOM with `interactiveUpdates`.\r\n- [ ] ReactNative?",
