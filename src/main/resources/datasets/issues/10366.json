  "body": "_(This isn't needed for 16.0.)_\r\n\r\nI think we're missing a top-level API. If you want to integrate with non-React code around you in an async way, then you probably have some parents around you. It's not always the case that you want to show those parents before React is done. Maybe you can hide them and then show them at the callback time.\r\n\r\nHowever, it would be better if you could start building the tree async with React, and then get a callback *before* we trigger life-cycles so that you can insert the tree into the actual DOM and do whatever manipulation you need. Only after that do we trigger the life-cycles. That way they will have the CSS and layout information available to them by virtue of being in the document already.\r\n\r\nI see two possible routes:\r\n\r\na) We just call out for this hook and then commit immediately after.\r\n\r\nb) We invoke a callback and pass another function. That function, when invoked, does the actual commit. This approach has precedence in the DOM with \"append async\" and offscreen canvas.\r\n\r\nThe second option is probably preferable but we should only do that if we can do it efficiently and cleanly.",
