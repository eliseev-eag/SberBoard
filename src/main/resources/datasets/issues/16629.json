Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nIt stopped working somewhere between react 16.8 and 16.9 , you can change the react and react_dom version in the demo project and see that it works as expected in 16.8\r\n\r\n**Workaround**\r\n\r\nFor now the issue can be worked around as demonstrated: https://github.com/mikecann/bgpage-hooks-issue/blob/master/bg.tsx#L5\r\n\r\nSo im not really sure whats going on but perhaps because background pages arent actually visually rendered to the screen then React has optimized things so that effects arent triggered?",
