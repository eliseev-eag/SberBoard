  "body": "The goal is to make it so we're not locked in to these existing as a gist on on any single person's account. This way if we want to make changes to the contents while 1 person is unavailable, it's totally doable. There are other ways we could solve that (easiest if we wanted to keep this on github is a standalone repo with each warning getting a file)\n\nDownside: There is currently some discussion happening on the gists, which could be helpful and it's a slightly longer turnaround to updating the content. Not sure what we should do about that, if anything.\n\nI grepped for all the unique fb.me links in master (15-stable matches) and opened all of them. These 4 were the ones that don't already link to some part of our docs (1 currently links to a specific issue which is probably ok). Only some minor changes were made to keep formatting and markdown consistency. We should probably do a pass over previous version (0.14, 0.13 should be enough) and do the same. I can do that if we want to take this.\n",
