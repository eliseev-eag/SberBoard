On any other modification, the cursor remains where it is, presumably because the value isn't \"overwritten\" by react.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe cursor should remain at the current position.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact: 15.3.1\r\nBrowser: Chrome 58\r\nOS: Win 7",
