  "body": "While writing tests for unsafe async warnings, I noticed that in certain cases, errors were swallowed by the `toWarnDev` matcher and resulted in confusing test failures. For example, if an error prevented the code being tested from logging an expected warning- the test would fail saying that the warning hadn't been logged rather than reporting the unexpected error. I think a better approach for this is to always treat caught errors as the highest-priority reason for failing a test.\r\n\r\nI reran all of the test cases for this matcher that I originally ran with PR #11786 and ensured they all still pass.",
