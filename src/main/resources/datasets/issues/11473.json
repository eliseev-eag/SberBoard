  "body": "Alternative to https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11346\r\n\r\nAPI for batching top-level updates and deferring the commit.\r\n\r\n- `root.createBatch` creates a batch with an async expiration time associated with it.\r\n- `batch.render` updates the children that the batch renders.\r\n- `batch.then` resolves when the root has completed.\r\n- `batch.commit` synchronously flushes any remaining work and commits.\r\n\r\nNo two batches can have the same expiration time. The only way to commit a batch is by calling its `commit` method. E.g. flushing one batch will not cause a different batch to also flush.\r\n\r\nTODO: Specify error handling behavior.",
