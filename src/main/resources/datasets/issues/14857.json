  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?** *feature* but I can send a PR\r\n\r\nA gold nugget we're missing in the React toolbox is a new onChange event (with a separate name) that uses the native browser change event. It's not impressive, and it's not good for updating things as the user types, but it's great for validation.\r\n\r\nConsider this case (which could be simplified greatly with a bit of metaprogramming):\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<input onWhicheverEventName={e => { this.setState({ theValue: e.target.value }); this.validate() }} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt doesn't make sense to use onInput here (which is what React is making me do currently). You would have to implement extra logic to detect two events, `input` and `blur`. This doesn't make sense to me, coming from implementing stuff in pure DOM for performance.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nNo easy way in React to add a browser change event handler without a ref.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThere should be a new event, pick your poison:\r\n\r\n - onChangeAndBlur\r\n - onChangeNative\r\n - onChangeCompleted\r\n - onCompleteChange\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?** latest\r\n",
