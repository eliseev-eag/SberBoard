  "body": "The renderer package contains a fixture that has to be updated every time we change APIs. However it is not covered by Flow nor by full test coverage so it is very tedious to make sure you get it exactly right.\r\n\r\nI messed it up in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11213\r\n\r\nMaking changes to the API also means updating a lot of renderers at this point. It would be nice if the fixture could be built on top of the Noop renderer or something.\r\n\r\ncc @iamdustan @gaearon ",
