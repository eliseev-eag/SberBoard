  "body": "First of all, during my attempt to show you this bug, I found this weird behavior:\n\n1) http://jsfiddle.net/kb3gN/4092/ does not show any time wasted (on user click action)\n2) http://jsfiddle.net/kb3gN/4093/ does\nI don't know why one does show wasted time and not the other\n\nOn 2) I use shouldComponentUpdate=true, and we can see the time waste grows with the list size as well as the number of instances in the table.\n\nSo finally, to demonstrate my problem, see http://jsfiddle.net/kb3gN/4094/\nI've implemented correctly shouldComponentUpdate and now each time I add a new element in the list, it is considered as a waste of time. My table always show 1 instance: the one that just got inserted.\n\nI've had this problem on my app, when dealing with a paginated list (loading more items from the server as the user scrolls down). I don't think this newly inserted node should be printed in `printWasted` \n",
