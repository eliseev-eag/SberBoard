The hasAttribute function was the only thing causing React to not work in IE7 when using the appropriate shims. \n\nI tried to find a shim/sham to accomplish this, but it doesn't seem like it can be accomplished with it. \n\nAll tests pass, the lint doesn't, but it doesn't pass in master either.\n",
