  "body": "This is the base class that will be used by ES6 classes.\n\nI'm only moving setState and forceUpdate to this base class and the other\nfunctions are disabled for modern classes as we're intending to deprecate\nthem. The base classes only have getters that warn if accessed. It's as if\nthey didn't exist.\n\nReactClass now extends ReactComponentBase but also adds the deprecated\nmethods. They are not yet fully deprecated on the ReactClass API.\n\nI added some extra tests to composite component which we weren't testing\nto avoid regressions.\n\nI also added some test for ES6 classes. These are not testing the new\nstate initialization process. That's coming in a follow up.\n",
