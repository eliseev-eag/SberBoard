  "body": "This PR fixes a bug that we discovered earlier this week. It was hard to pint-point until the recent `invariant` was added to detect duplicate root event types being added (when they've already been added). I tracked the issue down to the fact that we don't always clear the root event types in `Press`. Furthermore, I was able to make a regression test that fails before this fix.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/15257",
