  "body": "It seems that in react@16 every React element children contains cyclic property `._owner.alternate.alternate.alternate.alternate`....\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19988985/56009001-c2c41100-5d10-11e9-839f-b4a4a608cf86.png)\r\n\r\nSo it is easy to cause \"Maximum call stack exceeded\" error when developer compares `props.children` in deep way(like [deep-equal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deep-equal)).\r\n\r\nThis caused bugs for community libraries like [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet): \r\nhttps://github.com/nfl/react-helmet/issues/441\r\n\r\nI am extremely curious about:\r\nWhy React has `_owner.alternate`, and what it stands for?\r\nAs it is named as “_owner”, could it be better if we make “owner” not enumerable?\r\n\r\nI tried to search source code and but still can’t find any clue.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.",
