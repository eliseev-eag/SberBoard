Rollup calls named exports on these with dot notation. This seems very non-ideal in hot paths.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if there's an easy way to fix it on the build level. But scheduler is the only external module we use and it's easy to fix at callsites. So I just did that. Star imports for everything else stay an anti-pattern.\r\n\r\nThis also removes some re-export junk in the UMD bundle.\r\n\r\nFixed version:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"617\" alt=\"screen shot 2019-02-27 at 4 02 16 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/53504026-16540580-3aa9-11e9-9129-d621ec3f6f2f.png\">\r\n",
