  "body": "Depends on #1758.\n\nFixes #1698.\n\nPreviously, controlled components would update too soon when using something like ReactLayeredComponentMixin (i.e., before the layer's updates could propagate from the parent), causing the cursor to jump even when always updating the new model value to match the DOM state. With this change, we defer the update until after all nested updates have had a chance to finish, which prevents the cursor from misbehaving.\n\nAlso cleaned up the logic around updating a bit -- the .value and .checked updates in ReactDOMInput weren't being relied on at all so I removed them and opted for a simple forceUpdate instead. I also got rid of _isChanging which hasn't been necessary since the introduction of update batching.\n\nTest Plan: Tested the example in http://jsfiddle.net/Bobris/ZZtXn/2/ and verified that the cursor didn't jump. Changed the code to filter out numbers and verified that the field prevents typing numbers (attempting to do so still causes the cursor to jump to the end). Also verified that controlled and uncontrolled radio buttons, textareas, and select boxes work.\n",
