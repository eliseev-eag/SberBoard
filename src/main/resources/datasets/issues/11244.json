  "body": "A bit opinionated but here goes. Let me know if you disagree. I don’t feel very strongly about either, just cutting down things that aren’t necessary.\r\n\r\n* `name`: It's not published on npm so there's no need for a name there. Having a name makes it a bit more confusing because then it seems like it would be published.\r\n\r\n* <s>`version`: It, too, doesn’t *really* mean anything and can be safely deleted. People who want to see the current version would be better advised to look at the changelog since it also describes what’s new in that version.</s> Decided to keep it in in case some services depend on it.\r\n\r\n* `commonerConfig`: [Commoner](https://github.com/facebookarchive/commoner) has long been archived. Since this file isn’t on npm, dropping this can’t be a breaking change.",
