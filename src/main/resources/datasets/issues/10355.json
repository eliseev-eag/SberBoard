  "body": "React 16 comes with a new, completely rewritten [shallow renderer](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/testing/ReactShallowRendererEntry.js). The new renderer doesn't currently provide an `unstable_batchedUpdates` method. This issue is for discussion about whether it _should_ implement that method.\r\n\r\ncc @flarnie and @lelandrichardson who recently discussed wrt its potential impact on Enzyme.\r\n\r\ncc @koba04 who initially added the integration with Enzyme and who also provided [an example implementation](https://github.com/koba04/react/commit/ca78c92635525ad2dfd8012e7e5527a5876ce130).",
