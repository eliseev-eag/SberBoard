It's easy to misunderstand.\r\n\r\nIf `getDerivedStateFromProps` is also executed after `setState`, then the name should be named as `getStateFromProps`. \r\n\r\nIn addition, can `getDerivedStateFromProps` and `getStateFromProps` both exist?\r\n\r\n**getStateFromProps:** Called every time a component is rendered, regardless of the cause of the update.\r\n**getDerivedStateFromProps:** Only called if the component was re-rendered by its parent.\r\n",
