  "body": "DO NOT MERGE: Doing a PR so I can test on fb first. \r\n\r\nYou should read this whitespace changes off. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds act() by default to react-test-renderer's `.create`, `.update`, and `.unmount` methods. \r\n\r\nWe risk a major breaking change with having added warnings on unqueued effects outside of an act scope. Eg: A lot of people's snapshot tests will break; this would be good, if they didn't have to first wrap their renderer helper with `act()`, and then update snapshots.\r\n\r\nBroadly, we could also make a case why this makes sense to any consumers; they'll be using it only in testing scenarios, which we'd want to wrap in `act()` anyway\r\n\r\nFor our internal tests, this had the effect that a larger portion of the test was just wrapped with an outer `act()`, letting us test incremental updates by advancing the `Scheduler` manually.\r\n\r\n- In the second commit, I also fix act()'s flow signature\r\n- in the third commit, I update our fixtures to account for the change",
