Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/qx3m4rl7wq\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe documentation should explain whether components utilizing `memo` should re-render on context change\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"react\": \"^16.8.6\",\r\n\"react-dom\": \"^16.8.6\"\r\n```\r\n",
