  "body": "Implements the HTML5 `key` property for all browsers and normalizes behavior of those that already do, only special keys are supported. Non-special keys **cannot** be supported because they depend on the user's keyboard layout which cannot be determined, among other things. IE (IE9+ even) and latest FF both support the `key` property, but they are broken for anything but special keys.\n\nDeprecates my PR https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/502, while you can listen to other values for which and keyCode, doing so relies on the user having a specific keyboard layout, which is quite simply broken behavior (and quite dangerous as it is not immediately apparent).\n\nSo all-in-all, this is pretty much as good and reliable as is humanly possible today, in **any browser**, and it's compatible with the future of HTML5.\n\nWhy would you want this? If you're making a webapp that should be in any way \"keyboard friendly\", like say, listen to enter in a field, or support pressing the arrows keys in a slideshow, then you need this, or you need to make it yourself. In my opinion, this is a hugely useful feature that is quite broken by default in browsers and something that should be solved and not thrust upon the users.\n\nYou can play with it here: http://dev.cetrez.com/jsx/ (check the console)\n\n```\n   raw     gz Sizes\n341286  68450 build/JSXTransformer.js\n135467  27432 build/jasmine.js\n1033330182163 build/react-test.js\n495169 103484 build/react-with-addons.js\n103829  29131 build/react-with-addons.min.js\n461512  96312 build/react.js\n 97113  27265 build/react.min.js\n\n   raw     gz Compared to master @ 564c8669f8ef511b9fc59e7006af5c8db30e4585\n     =      = build/JSXTransformer.js\n     =      = build/jasmine.js\n     =      = build/react-test.js\n +1379   +551 build/react-with-addons.js\n  +691   +387 build/react-with-addons.min.js\n +1379   +545 build/react.js\n  +692   +381 build/react.min.js\n```\n",
