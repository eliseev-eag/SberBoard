  "body": "I have a list with many children (>1000). When a change occurs in my scenario I have to setState on the list, which re-renders the list and all its children. I have optimized the children - they are keyed properly  and also have shouldComponentUpdate implemented to be very very quick. When the change in the list occurs, I only have to update 1 or 2 children (I know exactly which ones), even if I may have hundreds/thousands of children. Yet it still takes a noticeable amount of time, since React reconciliation loops over all the children and checks if they should be updated or not.\n\nIs there any special approach I can take that I may be unaware of?\n",
