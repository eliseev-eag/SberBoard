Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nSee the React 16 repro here: https://codepen.io/matthewg0/pen/XymjYo\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIn React 15, and in plain HTML, the behavior is that the cursor is placed at the _start_ of the input.\r\nReact 15: https://codepen.io/matthewg0/pen/NEGRzv\r\nPlain HTML: https://codepen.io/matthewg0/pen/wQKoap\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReproduces as of React 16.  Worked as expected in React 15.",
