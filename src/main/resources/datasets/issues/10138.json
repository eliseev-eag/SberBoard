  "body": "react-native-web and react-primitives currently access a few internals\r\nfor shimming DOM events into native ones.  Changes in react@16 packaging\r\nhide these internals, which has made it difficult for these projects to upgrade.\r\nchange adds a submodule to react-dom, unstable-native-dependencies that\r\nincludes the necessary modules to continue enabling that method of\r\ndom-native event injection.\r\n\r\nThe bundle config is currently a bit of dogscience.  The one thing I really changes were:\r\n\r\n- basically copied it from react-dom\r\n- added an externals / globals alias for react-dom in order to import it from inside the module\r\nwhich was required to inject the shared ComponentTree into this module.\r\n- removed the fb entry point since I wasn't sure what it did or if it would be necessary",
