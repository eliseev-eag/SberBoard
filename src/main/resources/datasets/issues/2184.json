  "body": "For new developers such as myself understanding exactly when component functions are called, such as `shouldComponentUpdate` and `render`, can be very confusing. I have read `http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html` many times but have failed to piece together a coherent image.\n\nIs there a more detailed reference that perhaps contains diagrams?\n\nIf not it would be a great thing to have. In the meantime I could read the source but I think would benefit others.\n\nThanks\n",
