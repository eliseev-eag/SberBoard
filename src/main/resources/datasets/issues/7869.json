The main example is based on [Dan's blog post](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/13/mixins-considered-harmful.html).\n\nI've avoided any discussion of mixins, since these are new docs and mixins are effectively deprecated. What do people think of this? Should we at least mention that they exist, even if we don't want people to use them?\n\nAfter this, I'll work on a companion doc about render callbacks that compares the two approaches.\n",
