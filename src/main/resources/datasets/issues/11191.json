  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen a `onMouseEnter` event is triggered on an element, the event is lost when the mouse comes over a child rendered based on this event. This didn't happen in React 15, where hovering over the newly created child would persist the event.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template for React 16: https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/, template for React 15: https://jsfiddle.net/hmbg7e9w/).**\r\n\r\nReact 15 (expected behavior): https://codepen.io/anon/pen/mBKmzN\r\nReact 16 (same code): https://codepen.io/anon/pen/NazjBN\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, hover anywhere in the red. Then when the menu opens, try to hover anywhere with blue background.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nHovering over the newly created child element should persist the `onMouseEnter` event\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nTestes with React 16 on Chrome/Linux (latest Ubuntu Mate), have not tested anywhere else\r\n",
