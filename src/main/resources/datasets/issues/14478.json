Just wanna confirm the desirable behavior so that I can fix them at once.\r\nCase 1. \r\n```js\r\n// Pass the linter. Since it's an early return, should it pass?\r\nfunction Foo() { \r\n  return true;\r\n  useEffect(() => {});\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCase 2. \r\n```js\r\n// Linter breaks. Hooks should not allowed in loops. Maybe we should throw a warning?\r\nwhile(value) { \r\n  break;\r\n  useEffect(() => {});\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCase 3.\r\n```js\r\n// Linter breaks. Conditional throw error passes. Should we pass this one, too?\r\nthrow new Error(\"Oops!\"); \r\nuseEffect(() => {});\r\n```\r\nCase 4.\r\n```js\r\n// Linter breaks, but hooks after infinite while loop passes. \r\n// Should we pass this one or we should throw warnings for both unreachable cases?\r\nfor (;;) {}\r\nuseEffect(() => {});\r\n```\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThrow a warning or pass.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
