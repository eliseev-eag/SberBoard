  "body": "This fixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5027 by making entering/leaving transitions interruptible, just like CSS:\n- It internally keeps track of whether a component is appearing, entering, or leaving\n- If a component is removed while it's entering or appearing, its state is set to leaving and its `componentWillLeave` is called immediately\n- If a component is added back while it's leaving, its state is set to entering and its `componentWillEnter` is called immediately\n- When `componentWillAppear` calls its callback, no action is taken unless the component is in appearing state.\n- When `componentWillEnter` calls its callback, no action is taken unless the component is in entering state.\n- When `componentWillLeave` calls its callback, no action is taken unless the component is in leaving state.\n\n**I haven't yet edited the tests to reflect the new behavior, work in progress.**\n",
