  "body": "Currently while building React a warning appears:\r\n> No parser and no filepath given, using 'babylon' the parser now but this will throw an error in the future. Please specify a parser or a filepath so one can be inferred.\r\n\r\nThis occurs because no config has been passed to Prettier invoked in build process.\r\n\r\nAs a solution I purposed adding `{parser: 'babylon'}` option but you should decide if whole config should be passed here.\r\n\r\nI have also tested importing and passing whole Prettier config on my local machine and I stumble across a problem. Parameter `overrides` is not supported from other sources than while reading Prettier config file by Prettier CLI itself (https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier/issues/68#issuecomment-343069185). It means that in this case any overrides should be done manually inside `build.js` file.\r\n\r\nSo it seems that even when you decide to pass whole config there is no option to have only one version of Prettier config in project (located in `.prettierrc.js`).",
