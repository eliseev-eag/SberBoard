Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nTested and reproducible in React 16.2.0, 16.0.0, and 15.6.2, in iOS simulator (iOS 11.x) and actual device. \r\n\r\n**Edit: On further investigation, it seems like this might be an issue with Safari itself, or the underlying rendering engine...I can close this if it's a no-op for the React team.",
