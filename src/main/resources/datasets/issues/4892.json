  "body": "Our React app was triggering the following error during navigation events:\n\n`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'firstChild' of undefined`\n\nThe error was occurring in the function `findComponentRoot`, when it failed to find a component for an event callback.\n\nIn our app, this was happening when we would navigate during a blur event, and call `unmountComponentAtNode` on the rendering, in order to refresh the page. The docs for `unmountComponentAtNode` say\n\n> Remove a mounted React component from the DOM and clean up its event handlers and state\n\nHowever, this does not seem to be the case. After we refresh the page with `unmountComponentAtNode`, there were other React-bound callbacks still in React's queue for that event. Leading to the error.\n\nThe docs and intuition seem to imply `unmountComponentAtNode` should clear these callbacks, since it knows the components will no longer exist to handle them.\n",
