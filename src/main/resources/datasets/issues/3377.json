  "body": "See http://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/3887/ for example code.\n\nWhen setting and removing focus from an empty `<input />` field with some `placeholder` text, the `onChange` event is triggered for IE 11 (I have not tested older versions). It does not trigger for other browsers.\n\nMy current work-around is to test the `value` that was last passed to the input with what is returned by `event.target.value`, and only act if they are different, but it would be nice if React would not send the change-event in the first place.\n",
