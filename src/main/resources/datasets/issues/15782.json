Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nCreate a new CRA\r\nChange index.js to register service worker\r\nfollow steps to deploy to gh-pages\r\nfill out manifest to include all required fields for installabiity \r\nNotice you cannot install because `This page is controlled by a service worker, however no start_url was found because no manifest was fetched.`\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nBe able to install this PWA. \r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nAll browsers. Mac OS, React 16.86\r\n",
