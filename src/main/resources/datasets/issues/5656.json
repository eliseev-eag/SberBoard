  "body": "Documentation doesn't have neither any examples nor links to examples.\n\nI want to know how, step by step, to use React on a server in an Expressjs application. How component files should look, how they are connected to templates and layouts, how Expressjs' `response.render('template')` should behave if I render react on server, how to include React components in a template, should components be compiled in advance, and many other questions.\n\nIn particularly, I have a Dust.js template that is rendered this way in a controller:\n\n```\nrouter.get('/', function(req, res, next) {\n    res.render('index', {\n        title: 'Title',\n        page: 'index',\n        foo: 'Foo'\n    });\n});\n```\n\nI compile and concat my `js` assets in one `app.js` file and include it in my template like this:\n\n```\n        <script src=\"/js/app.js\" type=\"text/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\" async></script>\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nAnd now I want to know how to use React on a server. How I need to change my current routine to compile/render react AND my template on a server.\n\nFor now when I use `ReactDOMServer.renderToString` and `ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup` I get these errors and I don't know what does it mean because React documentation doesn't have any errors explanations:\n\n`Error: Invariant Violation: renderToStaticMarkup(): You must pass a valid ReactElement.`\n`TypeError: Cannot read property '__reactAutoBindMap' of undefined`\n",
