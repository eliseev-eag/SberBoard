  "body": "I posted a [SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/50055552/1270459) and created an [issue on the Voyager project](https://github.com/vega/voyager/issues/798) but thought I'd also document it here. \r\n\r\nI'm using components from [Voyager](https://github.com/vega/voyager) which uses React 15. I have the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning: React.createElement: type is invalid -- expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in. Check the render method of  DataSelectorBase.\r\n\r\nUncaught Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in. Check the render method of  DataSelectorBase.\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"996\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-04-26 at 11 41 45 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/822034/39348317-78951274-49ab-11e8-9c37-0d5b4fb4bc97.png\">\r\n\r\nI know in most cases this error implies `import`/`export` problems but I don't think there's anything wrong with how [`LoadData`](https://github.com/vega/voyager/blob/master/src/components/load-data-pane/index.tsx#L37) and [`DataSelector`](https://github.com/vega/voyager/blob/master/src/components/data-selector/index.tsx#L272) are exported in Voyager. I also believe I imported `DataSelector` right:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { LoadData } from 'datavoyager/build/components/load-data-pane/index';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe most weird thing is that when I `npm link` to the same version of Voyager locally, I don't get this error, but when I use the released version, the error shows up?!\r\n",
