  "body": "We went past the tipping point on this a while ago and we need to surface our translated docs. I spent some time this week looking into other options for generating our site but this gets us there way faster with minimal changes. It's only half the work though - there but there's still a bunch to do. The infra is here now but we're still going to have some hacks we have to do to make links work right.\n### How it works (we're using http://jekyll-langs.liaohuqiu.net/):\n- translated files live side by side like we already have with the exact same file naming convention (though perhaps we will end\n- translated phrases live as key-value pairs in `_i18n/lang.yml`. I've done as much of the Korean as I can (copy + paste from the titles in the docs files)\n- We can use these keys in a lot of places, `{% t string|key %}` outputs the value and will fall back to English (default).\n- Due to limitations in how Jekyll passes things around there unfortunately a lot of duplicate keys in these files. I tried to cut it but couldn't make it work.\n- English is unchanged (well except for 1 tiny thing which actually is broken on 1 page)\n### Give it a try:\n\nI set up a testing server - http://reacti18n.zpao.com/react/ko-KR/docs/getting-started.html\n\nLinks are definitely broken right now so no need to remind me :)\n\nBut I wanted to get some feedback before I took it any further, namely from the people who have been doing the bulk of the translation work - @tako-black, @makky3939, @marocchino, @sairion (and many others, perhaps you can spread the word amongst the translators you've been working with?), @spicyj . Does this approach so far seem like it's more maintainable for you moving forward? All of your current links will be broken but I'm not too worried about that (are you?).\n### TODO:\n- [x] make next / prev / sidebar links actually go to current language. Might need to do full paths in next/prev, needs more investigation\n- [ ] link to other language entry points somewhere\n- [ ] decide if we want full locale in the url or the short version (`/ko-KR/` vs `/ko/`, `/ja-JP/` vs `/ja/`, `/zh-CN/` vs `/zh/ (or cn?)`)\n- [ ] Make header fragment links work\n- [ ] language specific CSS (eg, font-size)\n",
