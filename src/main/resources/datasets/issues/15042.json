  "body": "Possible **bug** in v**16.8.3**.\r\n\r\nWhen I push the `.` key on the numpad (with \"Num Lock\" turned on of course), it produces the following property values within the `onKeyPress` handler, in the event object in Chrome: \r\n```\r\ncharCode: 46,\r\nkey: \".\",\r\nkeyCode: 0\r\n```\r\nBut in Internet Explorer, it produces:\r\n```\r\ncharCode: 46,\r\nkey: \"Delete\",\r\nkeyCode: 0\r\n```\r\nI would expect the `key` property to be equal in both cases. The value `\"Delete\"` is incorrect as it is the decimal which is being pushed. But the decimal key is in fact the Delete key when the Num Lock is off... but it's weird that Chrome would understand that, but not IE, especially considering the key is producing the same `charCode` on both browsers.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that I am dealing with a \"Synthetic Event\" whose job it is to normalize the cross-browser differences. This seems like it would've been caught via tests or other issues, so I'm not sure this is a React issue. Does React own the library which provides the Synthetic Event implementation?\r\n\r\nThank you for any help :)",
