  "body": "With React 16 we don't have an attribute whitelist so both `src={obj}` and `myattribute={obj}` would be valid. The objects get stringified and added as attributes for smooth migration path because a lot of the existing code already depends on this behavior.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one pitfall here. Sometimes you made do `<div {...rest}>` and not realize that `rest` includes an object whose stringifying is unusually expensive. For example a deeply nested Immutable Map. Now, this wouldn't produce an error, but it would slow down rendering for no good reason.\r\n\r\nWe could protect against this by putting `performance.now()` counters around the places where we stringify attributes. If stringification takes more than, say, 2 milliseconds, then something bad is going on, and we should probably warn.",
