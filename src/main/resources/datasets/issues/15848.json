  "body": "This adds a `within` prop to the `Focus` event component, which makes events fire when descendants are focused and blurred in addition to the immediate child. This allows additional flexibility when building more complex components. The `within` name aligns with the CSS [:focus-within](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-within) pseudo class.\r\n\r\nFor example, in a Date Picker component I'm working on, the focus ring CSS class is added to an outer element when one of the descendent elements is selected. Doing it with one `Focus` component wrapper is easier than wrapping each individual focusable element, propagating the focus state (and focus visible state) upwards and maintaining state manually on the common parent.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"210\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-06-09 at 3 42 42 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19409/59165208-4447dd80-8acd-11e9-96bc-2e4835f61363.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"957\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-06-09 at 3 43 52 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19409/59165217-6c374100-8acd-11e9-8683-9261bb12c486.png\">\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the DOM structure above, the div with `role=\"combobox\"` gets the focus ring class applied to it, but the individual divs with `role=\"spinbutton\"` are actually focusable. This PR allows me to wrap the entire combobox in a `Focus` component with the `within` prop set in order to apply the focus ring class rather than each individual spinbutton.",
