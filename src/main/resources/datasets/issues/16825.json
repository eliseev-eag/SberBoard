This test fails because the code doesn't give any warnings, but it should.\r\n\r\nSpecifically this should give a warning:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst debouncedCb = useCallback(debounce(cb, {wait: 300}), []);\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore context: https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1174382572052180992\r\n\r\nLet me know if you'd like me to continue with fixing this or if I'm missing something.",
