  "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nIt seems that currently if you pass a React attribute to a custom component, it doesn't replace it with the html counterpart but just renders it as text.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```<amp-img className=\"my-image\" />``` will render ```<amp-img classname=\"my-image\" />```.\r\n\r\nApparently, that's by design, since we found that [there are tests](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/ce8c51f8d3c26723c134e23002e7f5195f7b8c68/src/renderers/dom/shared/__tests__/ReactDOMServerIntegration-test.js#L667-L670) explicitly checking this behaviour.\r\n\r\nDo you really think that this should work the way it is? It feels a bit strange that for custom components you would need to use `class` instead of `className`. \r\n\r\n(thanks @jacksbox for the pairing session ðŸ˜ƒ)\r\n\r\nCheers",
