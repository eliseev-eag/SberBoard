  "body": "Looking at https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/client/wrappers/__tests__/ReactDOMButton-test.js - there are tests stating that `onClick` doesn't get fired if you click a button that is disabled. This doesn't seem to be shown anywhere in the documentation.\n\nSlightly tangental, if there's an `onClick` on a parent element of a `<button disabled={true}>`, and somebody clicks the button, is the `onClick` fired for the parent element?\n",
