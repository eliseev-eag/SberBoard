When there are two words - no whitespace is there.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nConsistent behaviour. As I understand, for React that would be second line in the fiddle (no whitespace).\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nLatest React. Tried in latest Firefox and Chrome, Win10. HAve no idea about previous versions.\r\n",
