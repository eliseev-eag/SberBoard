  "body": "**For the changelog, this also implements #7267 in Stack.**\r\nIt implements it for Fiber too, in addition to other Stack-related Fiber warnings and invariants.\r\n\r\n==========\r\n\r\nWhile working on the fiber implementation of ReactTestRenderer I came across this warning which is not yet implemented for fiber.\r\n\r\nInitial questions:\r\n\r\n* Are there any areas of the fiber impl where errors and warnings are expected to live? This is the first instance added to BeginWork which I think may indicate this warning should exist elsewhere\r\n* This doesnâ€™t actually stop any ref from being attached. How should that be done?\r\n* A related test seems to show refs throwing an error if used on a top-level SFC. Should that exist in the same area of the code or elsewhere?",
