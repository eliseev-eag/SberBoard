  "body": "useStateObject is using useState for create single object and exposing it's properties as accessors.\r\nIt removes the use of [val, setVal] array and use property accessor for both get and set.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n`const state = getStateObject({ test: 1 });\r\n\r\nconst update = (val) => {\r\n\tstate.test = val;\r\n}\r\nreturn <div>{state.test}</div>`\r\n\r\n**Before submitting a pull request,** please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n1.
