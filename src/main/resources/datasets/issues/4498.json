  "body": "Hi,\n\nI'm using React for certain modules in a mature project which is primarily built around jQuery and server-side rendered HTML. The main routing mechanism loads a particular URL via `$.ajax` and then replaces the HTML of the content container of the page via `$('#content).html(result)`.\n\nWhen using React components on a page I noticed that I manually have to unmount the root components before leaving the page and loading a new page with `$('#content).html(...)`. In that case the React components are rendered into a `div` deeply nested somewhere in the '#content' container.\n\nUnmounting the root components rendered into the content container manually via `React.unmountComponentAtNode` works as expected. But I'm concerned that developers could forget to unmount their components which could lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior I guess.\n\nTherefore I would like to unmount all possible root components in a generic way directly from the router. Unfortunately I don't know how to get all the DOM nodes from a particular parent container in a generic way. \n\nThis doesn't work because the components are not rendered directly into the content container but somewhere in the content container hierarchy:\n\n``` js\nReact.unmountComponentAtNode(document.getElementById(\"content\"));\n```\n\nIs there any way to retrieve all root components for a given DOM element? Selecting all elements with `data-reactid` would not only select the root components but also child components. \n\nIt would be helpful if React would directly support unmounting of a whole container.\n\nThanks in advance for your help and keep up the good work!\n\nBenjamin\n",
