  "body": "Throughout my work on #10024, I found that I would get intermittent prettier errors from CI, and some of them seemed arbitrary. Changes that didn't fix any prettier issues would make CI prettier stop complaining, and changes that didn't add any bad formatting would make CI prettier get unhappy. Further, `npm run prettier` or `yarn prettier` (the recommended fix) never fixed the CI problems I was having.\r\n\r\nI've since realized that the reason that `npm run prettier` wasn't working was that that command attempts to run prettier over only the changed files, but CI checks all files to make sure they are correctly formatted. And, for whatever reason, `master` has a few dozen files that are incorrectly formatted right now. I suspect these files creeped in because of some problem in CI that was causing the arbitrariness I was seeing, but I'm not entirely sure.\r\n\r\nThis PR is just a result of running `npm run prettier-all` over the codebase and then fixing one tiny problem with linting (prettier eliminated three `eslint-disable-line` comments in `ReactDOMServerIntegration-test.js` which I had to reinstate).\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't fix the core problem that CI seems to sometimes approve of builds that violate prettier's formatting and thereby lets incorrectly formatted files in, but I honestly can't really figure out why that happens. In the meantime, though, I'm hoping that this checkin will reduce the number of times CI complains about my other PRs.",
