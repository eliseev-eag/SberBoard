  "body": "To all the Facebook Engineers working on [open source](https://code.facebook.com/projects/),\r\n\r\nWe at [Reactiflux](http://www.reactiflux.com/) just wanted to take a moment to thank you for all your hard work in 2016. Your job isn’t easy. You have a million requests coming at you all the time from both your internal teams and the external community. Dan Abramov once compared managing issues and pull requests to [juggling chainsaws on fire](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/804365646540709888). Yes, we know all of you get paid really well to do open source full time, and that your work meets Facebook’s needs, but we think that you have gone above and beyond in the way that you have treated the community.\r\n\r\nThe way that you guys respond to emails and Twitter mentions. The attention you give to each issue/PR. The time you give to different organizations doing podcasts and AMAs. The list goes on.\r\n\r\nWe’ve personally seen an amazing humility in each of you, and it’s a pleasure to be around you wonderful people. Thank you for what you do and the excellence you put into all your efforts.\r\n\r\nWe’d like to invite the React community to reply to this thread with your own “thank you” comments to the team at Facebook. Let’s show them how grateful we are! Feel free to include experiences with the team or just how the React ecosystem has helped you as a developer.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the Reactiflux community:\r\n@gabegreenberg\r\n@markerikson\r\n@KyleAMathews \r\n@taion\r\n@jquense\r\n@vcarl\r\n@benigeri \r\n@Phoenixmatrix\r\n",
