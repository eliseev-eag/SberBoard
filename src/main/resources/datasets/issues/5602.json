  "body": "Implements error boundaries for initial render, which allow React components to become isolation boundaries.  If a child of an error bounadry crashes, the error boundary has the ability to handle the error and render something different (like an error message or a frown face).  This allows application authors to partition their app into regions, and a crash in a single region won't take down the entire page/application.\n\nFixes #2461\n",
