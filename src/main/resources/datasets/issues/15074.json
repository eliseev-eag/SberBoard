  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug (maybe)\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIf wrapped in React.StrictMode and a function component contains a call to `useState`, the function (render) is called twice - even if the state setter is never called.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/lyw9514j4q\r\n(please see console)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI would expect it to only render once.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16.8.3 in Chrome on macOS Mojave; requires hooks so not tested with previous versions.\r\n\r\nThis may be related to https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12961 - but note that nowhere am I setting state (only initializing it).\r\n\r\nIf this is expected behavior please feel free to close. Thank you!",
