  "body": "There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding in the react community about how `defaultValue` works. It is often expected that if the `defaultValue` of an element is changed then that should be reflected in the UI. This is not the case since `defaultValue` is only set when the component is first rendered. \n\nWhen people complain about this (#1484, #1663, #2764) it is usually suggested that they use `value` instead of `defaultValue` but this is often seen as unpractical in a form were there are many input fields since all fields now need an `onChange` listener to be editable. (This is not actually true, you can put an `onChange` listener on a wrapping element but this generates a lot of warnings #1118, #3070).\n\nI feel that none of the above solutions are practical, but an easy solution is to set a `key` attribute on a wrapping element. If the form contains elements with `defaultValue` fields that are changed along with the key, the change will be reflected in the UI.\n\nI think this is a good solution for a common UI case where you have a list of entities you want to be able to edit. If you click one of them a form shows up with the entity value populated and if you click on another element you want the form to be updated with that entity's data.\n\nPerhaps it could be documented in order to avoid future confusion. Or is there an even better solution?\n",
