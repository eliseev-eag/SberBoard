  "body": "This allows classes to avoid the performance hit associated with autobinding on a per class basis, allowing a migration path for applications trying to increase their throughput. I added tests to ensure that even if a class opts out, its mixins are still autobound.\n\nInternally, while all of the usage of `createClass` within core have been removed (:fireworks: :tada: ), many of the addons are still using it and fully rewriting them does not seem like a priority. This PR would also allow these components to be optimized to remove autobinding as well.\n\nI'm leaning towards making `autobind` be part of `statics` rather than doing the `RESERVED_SPEC_KEYS` noop, but thought I'd see if there was any input.\n",
