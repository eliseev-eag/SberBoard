  "body": "Sorry if this already exists in some form or if I'm misunderstanding how everything works, but certain libraries (e.g., [react-hot-api](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-api)), depend on the use of `require('react/lib/ReactMount')._instancesByReactRootID`, which won't work if the only script available is  the React bundle (e.g., `react-with-addons-0.13.1.js`).\n\nFor my own projects, I've added a single line to essentially `src/browser/ui/React.js` to expose `ReactMount` as `React.Mount`, so that `require('react').Mount._instanceByReactRootID` will work.  It would be nice to have this available by default, however.  Apologies if it's available by default in some other form.\n",
