  "body": "**Bug**\r\nThis is due to version incompatibility of react and react-dom for certain versions. I've managed to fix the issue by using compatible react and react-dom versions:\r\n\r\n  \"react\": \"^15.3.2\",\r\n  \"react-dom\": \"^15.4.1\"\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWe've had a react codebase work for 2+ years, and as of recently, we encountered run time \"TypeError: internal instance is null\" errors. The cacheBuster was of no help as it would point to a generic window.onerror function. \r\n \r\nThe following is the error message in the browser:\r\n\r\nThe following error occurred: \"TypeError: internalInstance is null\". You may need to refresh the page. \"File: http://127.0.0.1:8080/dist/js/app.js?cacheBuster=1498505575156\" Line Number: 102926\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nNo runtime errors\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThe version that we encountered issues with are:\r\n  \"react\": \"^0.14.7\", \"react-dom\": \"^0.14.6\".\r\n",
