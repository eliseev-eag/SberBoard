  "body": "Is this all of them? I hope so.\n- Set text content after creating hierarchy, like the text is a child. I should've done this originally but I guessed it wouldn't matter. I was wrong (~20% perf difference in IE11).\n- IE throws when setting an enum-like property to an invalid value. I tried setting every property to the string 'a' and changed the ones that threw to be MUST_USE_ATTRIBUTE. I think these are all correct -- encType is the most suspicious one based on the existing comments but I tested in IE8 and it works fine as an attribute.\n- Avoid lastProps[key] lookup in initial render: This makes both Firefox and IE 15-20% faster in initial render (!!). On my PE benchmark, createElement is now on par with HTML in Firefox and faster in IE11 (before, it was slower). (**Edit:** Maybe not. I might've screwed up the benchmark.)\n",
