Instead we can organize the code in terms of explicit states - which is what the original prototype did.\n\nBefore componentDidMount (i.e. `current === null`):\n- Never begun.\n- Have been begun before but never completed.\n- Have been completed before, not committed, but hasn't begun this time around.\n- Begun but not yet completed.\n- Completed but not yet committed.\n\nAfter componentDidMount (i.e. `current !== null`):\n- Haven't begun an update yet\n- Have been begun before but never completed.\n- An update have been completed before, not committed, but hasn't begun this update.\n- Begun update but not yet completed.\n- Completed update but not yet committed.\n\nThe \"children\" set of a component also have some states:\n- Never reconciled.\n- The current set last committed.\n- A previously reconciled set that hasn't committed yet.\n",
