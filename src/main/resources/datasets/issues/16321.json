  "body": "When React detects a deprectated/unsafe lifecycle method, the warning points to a page with more details on the why/what of the warning. However, the actual link (https://fb.me/react-async-component-lifecycle-hooks) uses the phrase \"lifecycle-hooks\" which is confusing since it doesn't have anything to do with hooks. This PR changes the link to something less confusing - https://fb.me/react-unsafe-component-lifecycles.\r\n",
