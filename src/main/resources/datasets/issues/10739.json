  "body": "### Background ###\r\nI see from [this issue thread](#1471) that recent changes were pushed in `15.6.x` that have – to my mind – broken some of the expected behavior when it comes to firing `onChange` events in a group of radio button inputs.\r\n  \r\nI am aware of the conversation in #1471, but the problem it's describing is not exactly the same as this so far as I can tell. \r\n  \r\nNote that the problem I'm about to describe *does not occur* in React <=`15.4.x`.\r\n  \r\n### Expectations ###\r\nWe would expect an individual radio button's `onChange` to fire in these two conditions (among others):\r\n1.  A radio input is clicked and it's state changes\r\n2.  A label for any radio input is clicked, causing (1).\r\n  \r\nIndeed, native elements work precisely this way:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<html>\r\n    <head></head>\r\n    <body>\r\n        <input type=\"radio\" id=\"radio1\" name=\"radiogroup\"/>\r\n        <label for=\"radio1\">One</label>\r\n        <input type=\"radio\" id=\"radio2\" name=\"radiogroup\"/>\r\n        <label for=\"radio2\">Two</label>\r\n    </body>\r\n    <script>\r\n        var r1 = document.getElementById('radio1');\r\n        var r2 = document.getElementById('radio2');\r\n        var handler = function(event){\r\n            console.log(event);\r\n        };\r\n        r1.addEventListener('change', handler);\r\n        r2.addEventListener('change', handler);\r\n    </script>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n  \r\nIf you click the above radio buttons and observe the console output, you'll see that the event is firing as expected: only when a desired input's state is being changed to something new.\r\n  \r\n[Here is a Codepen example](https://codepen.io/darth-cheney/pen/PJZjEq/)\r\n  \r\n### React Expectations ###\r\nThe following React component will work as expected in `15.4.x` but not `15.6.x`:\r\n   \r\n```jsx\r\nconst RadioTest = (props) => {\r\n    let handler = (event) => {\r\n        console.log(event);\r\n    }\r\n    return(){\r\n        <div>\r\n            <input\r\n                type=\"radio\"\r\n                name=\"radiogroup1\"\r\n                id=\"radio1\"\r\n                onChange={handler}/>\r\n            <label htmlFor=\"radio1\">One</label>\r\n            <input\r\n                type=\"radio\"\r\n                name=\"radiogroup1\"\r\n                id=\"radio2\"\r\n                onChange={handler}/>\r\n            <label htmlFor=\"radio2\">Two</label>\r\n        </div>\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\nIn `15.4.x` React, this the inputs in this component will work as you'd expect and as the native DOM elements work. [This Codepen shows it working properly with 15.4.1](https://codepen.io/darth-cheney/pen/yzeXKo/)\r\n  \r\nIn `15.6.x`, the `onChange` event **seems to only fire once**. [Here is another Codepen showing it doesn't work](https://codepen.io/darth-cheney/pen/MEKoxV/) when 15.6.1 is imported.\r\n  \r\nIt is, of course, entirely possible that I am doing something incorrectly (and have been doing so for a couple of years now), but the breaking change to my components only came with recent updates.",
