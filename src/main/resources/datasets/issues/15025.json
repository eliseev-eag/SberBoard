  "body": "They serve no purpose without a deps array. We have a similar rule on internally and it caught mistakes.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction MyComponent(props) {\r\n  const value = useMemo(() => { return 2*2; }); // Warning\r\n  const fn = useCallback(() => { alert('foo'); }); // Warning\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe still allow it from type perspective. In the future we might have a smart compiler that fills them in. But if you use this rule, you're doing it manually so you should be aware when your optimization doesn't work.\r\n\r\nThis is also a missing piece for the `useCallback` enforcement thing I'm working on separately. I'll send another PR for that.",
