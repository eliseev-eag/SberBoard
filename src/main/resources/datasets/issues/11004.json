  "body": "Adds lifecycle methods that are invoked during the complete phase. These can be used to prepare external resources, like subscriptions, before work is committed.\r\n\r\nCorresponding lifecycle methods are invoked if work is dropped without committing. Otherwise, the normal commit phase lifecycles (`componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`) are called.\r\n\r\nIn theory, the same underlying mechanism could be used to create and destroy persistent Yoga views in React Native without leaking memory.\r\n\r\nThe complete phase lifecycles are:\r\n- `unstable_prepareMount`\r\n- `unstable_prepareUpdate`\r\n\r\nThe garbage collection lifecycles are:\r\n- `unstable_abortMount`\r\n- `unstable_abortUpdate`\r\n\r\nTo avoid memory leaks, every call of a \"prepare\" lifecycle must have either a corresponding commit phase lifecycle or a corresponding \"abort\" lifecycle.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [ ] Dropped trees don't need to be garbage collected immediately. Defer by scheduling a callback. Requires refactoring to give `createWorkInProgress` access to the scheduler.\r\n\r\nBased on top of my other open async PRs. Relevant work starts with the commit titled \"Garbage collection.\"",
