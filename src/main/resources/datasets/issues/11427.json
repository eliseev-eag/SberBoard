I updated to 0.49 as it was out for a while, and doesn't have the regressions from more aggressive 0.50.\r\n\r\nThe size has *increased* but the reason seems to be mostly duplication of `'use strict'` that's now added in the bundle many times (for every module?). I don't understand why yet. We'll get rid of them with ES modules though (I think) so maybe not a big deal.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"499\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-11-02 at 01 03 32\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/32304805-a94168b8-bf69-11e7-9951-36b646029013.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"664\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-11-02 at 01 05 17\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/32304843-e674dbac-bf69-11e7-8b6d-b4c14ecced3c.png\">\r\n\r\nDiff: https://gist.github.com/gaearon/8de8c9d5f47c76061a900e16c938872c\r\n",
