  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nA bug maybe?\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nError caught in React lifecycle methods thrown twice in development mode.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template for React 16: https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/, template for React 15: https://jsfiddle.net/hmbg7e9w/).**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/nwp77vk9ql\r\n\r\nIf you look in the console you will see that one of the errors is caught, but the other one is still thrown as `Uncaught Error`. This could possibly be confusing to some people when they will see two identical errors in the console.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nShould an error be thrown only once?\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16\r\n\r\nI stumbled on this while fixing one of the tests that checked that component should throw in some conditions. This test started failing in React 16 because of the second `Uncaught Error` thrown by React. \r\n\r\nI'm not really sure that this is a bug, just wanted to clarify whether it was made intentionally or not. Seems like [this \"trick\"](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/e932ad68bed656eed5295b61ba74e5d0857902ed/src/renderers/shared/fiber/ReactFiberErrorLogger.js#L68) causes this behavior.\r\n\r\nIf this is a bug, I'm happy to help to fix it, if someone would suggest where to start with this :)",
