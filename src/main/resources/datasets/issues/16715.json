  "body": "## Based on #16663 and #16678 \r\n\r\nThis is a fragile pattern because there's only meant to be a single task per root, running at a single expiration time. Instead of binding the expiration time to the render task, or closing over it, we should determine the correct expiration time to work on using fields we store on the root object itself.\r\n\r\nThis removes the \"return a continuation\" pattern from the `renderRoot` function. Continuation handling is now handled by the wrapper function, which I've renamed from `runRootCallback` to `performWorkOnRoot`. That function is merely an entry point to `renderRoot`, so I've also removed the callback argument.\r\n\r\nSo to sum up, at at the beginning of each task, `performWorkOnRoot` determines which expiration time to work on, then calls `renderRoot`. And before exiting, it checks if it needs to schedule another task.",
