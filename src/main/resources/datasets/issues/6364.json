  "body": "Fix for #5700\n\nDev builds wrap synthetic events inside other events for a better debug experience. However IE/Edge won't allow access to the DataTransfer.dropEffect property if it's wrapped in this way.\n\nDataTransfer objects can't be constructed by JavaScript, you can only use ones that the browser hands to you. So the first time a drag event is fired, we test if we're in an environment that behaves this way and disable React's improved development experience if we are.\n",
