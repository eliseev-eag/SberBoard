  "body": "I came across this intriguing problem when trying to set value for an input from state.\nI want to have an input get its value from state (that is connected to a store), and also I want to update _onChange_ the value in the store through an action.\n\n```\n_updateInputField(type, e) {\n    ActionToStore(type, e.target.value) // Store will 'trigger' modification for type variable in state\n}\n\n[...]\n\n<input\n       onChange={this._updateInputField.bind(null, 'name')}\n       value={this.state.name} />\n```\n\nA huge problem this approach presents is that the input will get _very_ _slow_ when typing new characters due to the fact that this requires a new render of the component.\n\nSo, I started implementing _onBlur_ method and drop _onChange_, but I got a warning saying that the component will only be _read_ _only_ because it doesn't have an _onChange_ method.\n\nI also looked into _Two Way Binding_ that handles setting the state and updating the value of a component but got the same laggish result.\n\nAlso, another big problem with this is whenever I set state with a new value, i.e. when I type new characters, the typing cursor is reset to the end of the text in the input, so if I try to edit inside the current text I only get to enter one character before the cursor moves to the end.\n\nIs there a better official approach for these problems and if not is this a known problem and set to be solved in React's next versions?\n",
