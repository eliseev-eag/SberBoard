  "body": "The various React addons express a peer dependency on their matching React version. You can write a React component library that runs with multiple versions of React but depends on some specific addons as an implementation detail:\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-awesome-library\",\n  ...\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"react-addons-update\": \"^0.14.0 || ^15.0.0\"\n  },\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"react\": \"^0.14.0 || ^15.0.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you consume this library in a host environment that uses react@14, npm will still helpfully install the latest version of react-addons-update, which of course peer-depends on react@15, causing rather confusing UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY warnings since I, the consumer, am only looking around the `peerDependencies` block for version issues.\n\nSo my question is this: what are best practices for a library in this situation? Should I declare react-addons-update as a peer dependency, meaning that my consumer has to personally install not just React itself but also every react-addons-\\* that any of their dependents use? Seems annoying to my consumer and also a sort of an abstraction break for the sake of version matching.\n\nPerhaps react-addons-\\* should be more independently versioned so they accept multiple versions? Or maybe not declare a peer dependency on React if they don't actually need it (like for react-addons-update, which only uses a couple of the small, non-React-core utilities)?\n",
