  "body": "The `yield` method isn't tied to any specific root. Putting this on the main export enables test components that are not within scope to yield even if they don't have access to the currently rendering root instance. This follows the pattern established by ReactNoop.\r\n\r\nAdded a `clearYields` method, too, for reading values that were yielded out of band. This is also based on ReactNoop.",
