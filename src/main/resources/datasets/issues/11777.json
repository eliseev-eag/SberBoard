  "body": "I have a ReactVr object which I am rendering with the code below. After React is initialised I am periodically receiving server updates which I want to pass into React as props, how can I do this? Can props in the React object be set from my \"normal\" JS?\r\n\r\n```js\r\nReactVR.init(\r\n    './build/index.bundle.js',\r\n    document.body,\r\n    // third argument is a map of initialization options\r\n    {\r\n      initialProps: {\r\n        source: 'world.json',\r\n         userType: \"typ1\"\r\n        },\r\n      cursorVisibility: 'visible'\r\n    }\r\n  );\r\n```\r\n\r\n Server updates are coming via a Websockets connection, but from within React the messages are not being received, only in the \"normal\" JS.\r\n\r\nIn \"normal\" JS this returns data from the server, if I use the same within React the connection gets opened but the message is never received. However messages can be sent from within React.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nsocket.addEventListener('message', function (event) {\r\n        console.log('Message from server ', event.data);\r\n  });\r\n````",
