  "body": "New API for wrapping event handlers that need to fire before React yields to the browser. Previously we thought that `flushSync` was sufficient for this use case, but it turns out that `flushSync` is only safe if you're guaranteed to be at the top of the stack; that is, if you know for sure that your event handler is not nested inside another React event handler or lifecycle. This isn't true for cases like `el.focus`, `el.click`, or `dispatchEvent`, where an event handler can be invoked synchronously from inside an existing stack.\r\n\r\n`flushControlled` has similar semantics to `batchedUpdates`, where if you nest multiple batches, the work is not flushed until the end of the outermost batch. The work is not guaranteed to synchronously flush, as with `flushSync`, but it is guaranteed to flush before React yields to the browser.\r\n\r\n`flushSync` is still the preferred API in most cases, such as inside a `requestAnimationFrame` callback.",
