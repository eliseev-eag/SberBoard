  "body": "I have a use case where I am creating a `UIPane` element in one place (a window manager), passing its reference to an application bootstrapper and then the application is responsible for injecting other elements into its `UIPane`.\n\nSince the `setProps`-esque methods were removed for ES6 classes, how can I accomplish this?\n\n``` js\n// uiPaneElement (instance of UIPane) is created and rendered, reference is passed back\nwindowManager.createWindow().then(function(uiPaneElement) {\n    MyApp.mount(uiPaneElement);\n});\n\n// MyApp.mount - somewhere else in the system\nfunction(uiPaneElement) {\n    uiPaneElement.setProps({\n        children: this.content\n    });\n}\n```\n",
