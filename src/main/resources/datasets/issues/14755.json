It works well otherwise (if the breakpoint is at some other line , or no breakpoint in onKeyDown)\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/1yp35l2z54\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nonChange should be fired whether we are debugging or not.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact - v16.0.0 on sandbox, also happens with v16.7.0-alpha on local.\r\nChrome v71\r\nWindows\r\n\r\nI have created a video of me trying to debug it , can't seem to attach the video, so here is a poor quality gif\r\n![ezgif-1-cfc1584459db](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12510548/52216384-13a42d00-28bc-11e9-900c-4b32b35aa08c.gif)\r\n\r\n",
