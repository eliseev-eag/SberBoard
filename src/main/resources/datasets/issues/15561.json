I am using a controlled component for one of my input fields. When I try to type into the input field, it allows me to type one character, and then the cursor disappears. I have to use my mouse to place the cursor back in and continue typing.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/embed/oonxlv6y79\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nAs a user types in the input field, the letters should continue appearing, the cursor should remain in the input field, and the state should update.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.8.6\r\nChrome v73.0.3683.103\r\nFirefox v66.0.3\r\n\r\nNever tried it on previous versions.",
