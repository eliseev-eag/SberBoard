  "body": "This moves HTML and SVG configs in the same file as `DOMProperty`.\r\n(Literally copy and paste).\r\nThe injection hasn't been exposed, so we can get rid of it.\r\n\r\nI liked that it was easy in the past to search for \"SVG\" and find the list, but the downside is that it's harder to make this code more static when it's split between files. Putting it all in one place is the first step towards removing the metaprogramming.\r\n\r\nIn the second commit, I replaced some unnecessary invariants with warnings.",
