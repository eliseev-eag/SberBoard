Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n```\r\nconst Card = (\r\n  <Card>test</Card>\r\n);\r\n\r\n<Card />\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nwarning in dev tools or throws an error\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
