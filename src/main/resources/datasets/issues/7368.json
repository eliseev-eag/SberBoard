  "body": "This only applies to 15.2. I'm curious first as to if this would cause any problems or if theres a strong reason why allowing people to disable these warnings would be disagreeable.\n\nI would be open to alternative solutions. We have the problem that some of our props are used only in lifecycles or HOC's.\n\nWe often do this in render:\n\n```\nclass Child {\n  componentWillMount() {\n    // do something with this.props.otherProp\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const { children, ...props } = this.props\n\n    return <div {...props}><span>{children}</span></div>\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSo now otherProp gets passed to `div`, causing an error. But destructuring it out leaves an unused variable in render, which is not very nice either.\n\nMy initial thought was create a helper `eventProps()` that filters out just event props, but that is both verbose and potentially heavy (lots of O(1) lookups I guess).\n\nSecond thought is we could patch React.createElement, but that seems a bit hacky as well.\n\nI don't see much downside in passing in props to elements, though I guess I could see some dangers.\n",
