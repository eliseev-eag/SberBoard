  "body": "Ideally, we want to be able to leverage stronger minifcations/optimizations in our tooling so we can provide even smaller bundles. Tools such as Uglify and Google Closure Compiler can do this when set to mangle internal properties. However, this can break things when properties are expected to be consumed in the wild/public or by contract from another module. \r\n\r\nThe simplest way to deal with this limitation is to manually specify that the property shouldn't be altered when it's a string literal. Whitelisting is also an option, however that has some limitations and can result in properties that aren't public not being mangled simply because of them being a common name.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a WIP.",
