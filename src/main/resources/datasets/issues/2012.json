  "body": "Consider the following:\n\n``` js\nvar MixinNameHere = {\n\n    componentDidMount: function() {\n         // Do some stuff yo!\n     }\n}\n\nvar ComponentNameHere = React.createClass({\n\n     mixins: [MixinNameHere],\n\n     componentDidMount: function() {\n         // So some stuff here, then (or before) the parent should be called.\n     }\n});\n```\n\nThe above will not work because as you can see I have declared the existence of `componentDidMount()` twice. This would be fair if we didn't have libraries such as underscore or similar libraries that make the use of `_.extend` which then lets us do:\n\n``` js\nClassName.__super__.method.apply(this, arguments);\n```\n\nSo my question is, as some one who likes to abstract common logic out and use inheritance (I mix backbone with react) - _Why can I not use inheritance to say \"did my component mount, yes do this - oh and call the parent_\n",
