  "body": "Hello, I have had a crack at solving #12753. This change gives people the ability to traverse a component tree rendered by ReactDOM in a sanctioned way. Having a public API that provides this ability will be useful for testing libraries like Enzyme.\r\n\r\nThis is the most straight forward approach I could come up with.
