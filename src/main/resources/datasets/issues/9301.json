But there are so many other outdated browser versions that are unreasonable to support or worry about.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful if we had more specific guidelines on what browsers we should target. Does Safari on iOS 3 matter? FireFox 4? You get the idea.\r\n\r\nIf we had a well-documented range of browser version that we *know* should work it would make it a lot easier to run through our DOM fixtures in BrowserStack and know we're safe.\r\n\r\nMaybe the internal core team can work internally with analytics to see what browsers Facebook needs to support and work forward from there?\r\n\r\ncc @gaearon @nhunzaker ",
