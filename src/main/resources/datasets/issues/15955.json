  "body": "This PR makes some refinements to the `useEvent` hook API and also adds in a way to provide the responder a way of finding out if it is responding to an event hook (`context.isRespondingToHook()`).\r\n\r\n`useEvent` now takes an `EventComponent` rather than an `EventResponder`. This was an open question on the original PR and I wasn't sure what people would prefer to use when defining how hooks can be formed, but the general consensus is that it makes more sense to provide the event components instead of their raw event responders.\r\n\r\nAs a follow up, it would be great if someone could leverage the `isRespondingToHook` method to ensure `<Press>` side-effectful props (`preventDefault`, `stopPropagation`, `preventContextMenu`) become no-ops in the event responder when used with hooks â€“ probably with a nice warning too.",
