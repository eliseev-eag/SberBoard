Changing the first variable to null and rerunning will display the issue I'm experiencing. I'm not sure if this is expected behavior. Thanks in advance for any guidance.\n\nNote: I'm experiencing this on version 0.13.3. I created the fiddle on version 0.14.0 to be sure that upgrading wasn't going to resolve my problem.\n",
