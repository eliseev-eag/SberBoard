  "body": "Follow-up to work loop refactor in #16743.\r\n\r\nAfter the recent changes, the `isSync` argument to `renderRoot` is only used in a single place, to determine whether to call `workLoop` or `workLoopSync`. All other forked behavior was lifted into `performConcurrentWorkOnRoot` and `performSyncWorkOnRoot`. So, this goes one step further and inlines `renderRoot` into its callers.\r\n\r\nMost of the changes here are copy-pasting and moving stuff around. The high level flow is essentially the same. I split the work into small commits to help with reviewing.\r\n\r\nThe final commit is unrelated, but I've included it because it fixes the test I added in #16800. The fix relies on the `handleError` function I extracted as part of this refactor PR. I could also submit a separate fix that's independent of this PR; however, since it's not a super urgent bug, and I was planning to do these refactors regardless, I think it's fine to group these.\r\n\r\nFixes #16800",
