  "body": "@gaearon You're [arguing](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9328) that `ref` functions need to be called twice (once with `null`) *due to internal implementation details that are insignificant with respect to how end users use React*.\r\n\r\nEnd user don't care how their ref functions are called, just that they work. Honestly having them called twice is strange from a perspective of an end-user who knows nothing about React's internal implementation.\r\n\r\nYou haven't stated why end users *actually need* to guard against `null` values from duplicate calls to ref functions. It only complicates end-user code.\r\n\r\nI would urge for the internal implementation to be modified to stop calling ref functions twice.",
