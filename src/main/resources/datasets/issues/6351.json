  "body": "We have previously considered bundling React into a flat file without `require`s and a module map. \n\nFor example, #4230 is a (somewhat outdated) implementation of this.\n[Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) is another tool that, if Iâ€™m not mistaken, bundles modules in the same way.\n\nDo we really want to do this? What problems does this solve for us? If we want to try, what is the plan, and how do we evaluate whether the switch is worth it?\n",
