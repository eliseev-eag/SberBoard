  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nThis is a feature request.\n\nWe've discovered that it would be quite useful for us to be able to have React call some user-defined function after every batch of updates. In our case, we would like to ask our datastore to remove unneeded data after every round of updates (say, after a user clicks a button and after the resulting UI changes are done).\n\nThe existing lifecycle methods don't seem to provide us a way to achieve this behavior. Currently, we are releasing data from the datastore when we unmount components, which is suboptimal, as the new component we mount in its place might ask for very similar data. If we could have React execute a callback after each round of updates (when all the UI changes quiesce), we could avoid these unnecessary unload/reloads.\n\n@alexcole @pspeter3\n",
