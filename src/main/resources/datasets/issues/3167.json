  "body": "Summary:\nThis section was confusing. I reworded it from:\n\n\"JSX is completely optional. You don't have to use JSX with React. You can create these trees through `React.createElement`. The first argument is the tag, pass a properties object as the second argument and children to the third argument.\"\n\nto:\n\n\"JSX is completely optional; you don't have to use JSX with React. You can create React elements in plain JavaScript using `React.createElement`, which takes a tag name or component, a properties object, and variable number of optional child arguments.\"\n\nand additionally added another child element to the example code.\n\nTest Plan:\nRead the new paragraph!\n",
