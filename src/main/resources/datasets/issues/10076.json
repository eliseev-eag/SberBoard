More or less, using `nodeName` as an ID on an input causes references to the `nodeName` prototype property to be overriden. \r\n\r\nI've rebased @jimfb's original PR and added some test coverage. I've also browser tested this against IE11, Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.\r\n\r\nI would like to test down to IE9, however it looks like I need the Set polyfill on our DOM fixtures. **Is there a preferred method of adding the Set polyfill?**",
