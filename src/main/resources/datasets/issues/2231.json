  "body": "In the product I'm currently developing, there's a case where the `marginBottom` value gets dropped by React sometimes. Unfortunately I couldn't manage to reproduce the issue in my attempts at a reduced test case, and I can't post the link to the unreleased product yet, but I thought I'd report it anyway in case someone has additional information to go by.\n\nBasically the case is that in the application, I have components whose style value I set to an object that is something like this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar style = {\n    margin: \"0 10px\",\n    marginBottom: \"6px\",\n};\n```\n\nThese values are dependant on the screen size, which is listened to with `window.onresize` and then updated with something like `setProps({ screen: { width: screen.width, height: screen.height } });`.\n\nHowever, what I noticed is that when resizing the screen, more often than not, the components end up not having a vertical margin at all. I know that this is caused by React because I tried logging the value assigned to `style` in `render()` and its sound, and actually the `render()` is not even called when you hit this behavior. Something that makes the problem go away is setting the style as\n\n``` javascript\nvar style = {\n    margin: \"0 10px 6px 10px\",\n};\n```\n\ninstead, which is what I'm doing for now. The application is running v0.10.0, but I just tried with v0.11.2 and it's still reproducible.\n",
