  "body": "In the text, it used to say that the \"current version of the example\" ignores the input. But since the new version of the code is shown before this text, this is confusing. If I try to input a search using the code shown after the headline in step 5, it will not ignore my input. It is the code from the previous step that behaves this way. It is confusing for the reader to first see the code in step 5 (that has inverse data flow added to it), and then after that read that it will ignore the input.\n",
