  "body": "ISTM that it would be very useful for the library to detect (and test as needed) required language features (e.g. Map and Set). If they are found to be missing or lacking, then the library could either self-destruct (abstain from creating its interfaces) or set a flag to indicate that it is unusable in the present environment.\r\n\r\nWhat is the point of presenting interfaces to callers that have no chance of working? As it sits, the only way to work around this issue is for applications to detect the required features themselves. Of course, this requires careful analysis of the React scripts to determine the full extent of the requirements (e.g. partial implementations of Map and Set won't cut it).\r\n\r\nIt is the same story for DOM feature requirements (e.g. requestAnimationFrame) but one step at a time.\r\n\r\nThis is a common issue with libraries that makes cross-browser scripting more difficult than it should be. For more information:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-better-web-applications-david-mark/\r\n\r\nAs this is a very popular library at the moment, it would be nice to demonstrate some leadership in this area.",
