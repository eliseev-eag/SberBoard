  "body": "According to semver, only non-breaking changes are supposed to go into minor and patch version releases. With the release of 16.4, you have made breaking changes to `getDerivedStateFromProps`. Our entire codebase, running perfectly on 16.3.2 is a dumpster fire as soon as we raise that dependency to 16.4.\r\n\r\nThe only thing in your CHANGELOG about this *breaking* change is:\r\n\r\n> Properly call getDerivedStateFromProps() regardless of the reason for re-rendering. (@acdlite in #12600 and #12802)\r\n\r\nPlease revert this change and save it for 17.0.0, or provide proper documentation to what this change actually entails so that its use can be adjusted by those who have already implemented `getDerivedStateFromProps`.",
