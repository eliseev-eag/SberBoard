  "body": "**What is the current behavior?**\nIf I write a JSX component without an upper case, React gives me the [unknown prop warning](https://facebook.github.io/react/warnings/unknown-prop.html)\nI finally remember that \n\n> React's JSX uses the upper vs. lower case convention to distinguish between local component classes and HTML tags.\n\nBut I think it could be useful to remind it in the unknown props warning page as a reason of this warning.\nI spent some time debugging and not understanding this warning in this case. And I might not be the only one! \n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nUpdate [unknown props warning page](https://facebook.github.io/react/warnings/unknown-prop.html) and add a reason this warning could be appearing:\n4. You are using a JSX component without an upper case. React treats it as an HTML tag and probably doesn't recognize its props. React's JSX uses the upper vs. lower case convention to distinguish between local component classes and HTML tags.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\nI use React 15.2.1\n\nLet me know if you think it could be useful or it's just me who hasn't been enough careful!\n",
