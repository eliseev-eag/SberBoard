  "body": "Feature request: Can you consider renaming the byzantine lifecycle method names? I mean, come on, componentDidUpdate(), componentWillReceiveProps(), shouldComponentUpdate() ?  React is declarative, huh? How about concise method names that \"are easy to reason about\" as React claims to be? How about rendered() ? Or updated(). \n\nSometimes I think if the React team had invented REST, instead of GET and POST, we'd have clientWillRetrieveData and clientWillTransmitDataWithParameters. \n\nA lifecycle implies the passage of time. How about method names that succinctly indicate where things are within that cycle? How about method names that are useful to developers building applications, not compound, portmanteau words that reflect internal engineering complexity. \n",
