  "body": "I stumbled upon #1718 because I had the same issue in my application and tried to fix it by copying the code from the `ReactDOMImg` component as suggest by @syranide in a [comment](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1718#issuecomment-57080315).\n\nI removed the `error` event because as far as I am aware an `iframe` will never trigger it ([Source](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=365457)).\n\nThe test code is pretty ugly but I tried using `ReactTestUtils.SimulateNative.load` and when using it the tests passed with or without my changes. May be someone has a suggestion on how to make a prettier :smile: \nI also tested it in the different browser I have available (Chrome, Safari, Firefox and IE10).\n",
