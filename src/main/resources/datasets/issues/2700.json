  "body": "This moves ReactClass, ReactElement and ReactPropTypes into a legacy folder\nbut since it's not quite legacy yet, I call it \"classic\".\n\nThese are \"classic\" because they are decoupled and can be replaced by\nES6 classes, JSX and Flow respectively.\n\nThis also extracts unit tests from ReactCompositeComponent, which was\nterribly overloaded, into the new corresponding test suites.\n\nThere is one weird case for ReactContextValidator. This actually happens in\ncore, and technically belongs to ReactCompositeComponent. I'm not sure\nwe will be able to statically validate contexts so this might be a case\nfor dynamic checks even in the future. Leaving the unit tests in classic\nuntil we can figure out what to do with them.\n\nThis is only moving tests around. No new tests nor changed behavior.\n",
