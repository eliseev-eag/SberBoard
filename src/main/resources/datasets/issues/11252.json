  "body": "Here’s an overview of what happened:\r\n\r\n* `src/` is gone.\r\n* `packages/*` is now the source of truth.\r\n* Running `yarn` in the root sets up the symlinks in root `node_modules`.\r\n* Sources live in `packages/*/src`. I intentionally haven’t touched them.\r\n* Entry points in `packages/*/*.js` redirect to the sources. They are used for Jest and Rollup.\r\n* Entry points in `packages/*/npm/*.js` redirect to flat bundles. They are used for npm.\r\n* For now, you can still use Haste, but I plan to tighten it up (see future work below).\r\n* Internal fixtures now only work with Yarn, not npm. We depend on it anyway.\r\n* The +13K line diff is due to a bunch of lockfiles I added to fixtures.\r\n\r\n## Must Do\r\n\r\n- [x] Move all code\r\n- [x] Fix the build\r\n- [x] Update all configs referencing `src/`\r\n- [x] Why did some files get lost first time I committed? Any bad gitignores?\r\n- [x] Fix release script\r\n- [x] Fix fixtures now that `NODE_PATH` doesn't work \r\n",
