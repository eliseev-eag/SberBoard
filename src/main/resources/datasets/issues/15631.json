It isn't a viable options since we'd have to disable a whole lot of tests that run in yarn test-build See https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15763 instead \r\n\r\n---\r\nbased on #15591. this might be a bit controversial, but I agree with the reasoning. of note, we don't modify our own tests to satisfy this warning, instead using a feature flag to disable the warning for some tests. this is because we're testing the actual sequencing of work in these tests, and don't want to flush everything with act().\r\n\r\nyou probably want to see just this commit - https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15631/commits/9f7a346ee33f161e033484a3336ffdf966b82324",
