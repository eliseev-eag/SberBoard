  "body": "#### Scenario:\n- Have a react library & my own code that is using `react-addons-transition-group`\n- During webpack build process React gets bundled twice (I am including `react` in my webpack build process and `react-addons-transition-group` which does `require('react/lib/ReactTransitionGroup')`)\n- Apart from increased build size this is fine in webpack build process\n\nHowever when I try to use the react component that I built in another project (angular project using ngReact) where I load React globally for `ngReact` library, it creates an issue as there are multiple copies of React [refs-must-have-owner](https://facebook.github.io/react/warnings/refs-must-have-owner.html)\n#### Problem:\n\nIt now comes down to which React I am using. The one I have globally or the one that gets bundled with `react-addons-transition-group`?\n\nHas anybody else encountered this issue? Is there a workaround? Is there a plan to make `react` as peer dependency(and not require it directly)? I'm sure that will be a major change but asking it anyways. Please correct me if I have mis-understood the problem in anyways.\n##### PS:\n\nSorry about the previous issue, accidentally hit ENTER and github created the issue.  \n",
