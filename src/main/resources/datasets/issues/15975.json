  "body": "react-art is a renderer that's usually embedded inside other renderer trees (like react-dom, etc) we fire a warning for being wrapped in the 'wrong' renderer's act. For an embedded usecase like react-art, this would mean you'd always see the warning. we could expose a new act() for react-art, but really we just want embedded renderers to not trigger the warning.   \r\n\r\n- the first commit just fixes test infra for fixtures/dom (forking toWarnDev into itself)\r\n\r\n- the second commit is mostly what we're interested in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15975/commits/88fe0b416a7be82ddf34c6cb9c3051e1d130c4cc. For 'secondary' renderers like react-act, we don't want to fire missing act() warnings; the wrapping renderer will fire warnings anyway, and when it flushes, it flushes effects *across* renderers.\r\n\r\n- I could have used `isPrimaryRenderer` as the flag, but this is marked as false for react-test-renderer, and we *do* want the warning to fire for it. Hence a new flag.\r\n\r\n- I'm open to a new name for `shouldWarnUnactedUpdates`. ",
