  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?** Feature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe `ref` attribute passed to a DOM node can be either a callback or a `RefObject`, but not both. Sometimes, that's exactly what's required: for example, a library like [react-pose](https://popmotion.io/pose/api/posed/#posed-usage-create-a-posed-component-existing-components) demands ref forwarding to work with a React Component, but you'd also like to retain a reference to the _same_ parent DOM node within that component itself for a different reason. It's often not possible to nest DOM nodes to achieve a similar thing using two different ref attributes as that breaks layout.\r\n\r\nHere's a link to a naive attempt to achieve this: https://codesandbox.io/s/4jyw3q3v57\r\n\r\nI'm not surprised this doesn't work as there's no reason for the parent ref callback to fire, but I don't know how else to go about it.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe callback provides the component with its own reference to the parent DOM node, whilst also providing it to the parent component via the passed `RefObject`.\r\n",
