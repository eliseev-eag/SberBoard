  "body": "If I create a component that accepts functions as its children, I'm not able to use `React.Children.map` to map through them (it returns nothing). I instead have to just use `props.children.map()` - but that throws an error if there's only one child.\n\nHere's a JS Bin illustrating the issue: http://jsbin.com/fufaga/edit?js,output\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug, or intended functionality, or if it's just not recommended to build components this way.\n\n(The JS Bin example is using React 15.1, but I'm experiencing this on 15.3.1 as well.)\n",
