  "body": "I am aware that:\n\n> Note that for performance reasons propTypes is only checked in development mode\n\nhttps://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#prop-validation\n\nIn development mode, we have \"models\": collections of `propTypes`, e.g.\n\n``` js\nimport { PropTypes } from 'react';\nimport Layout from './../../component/Layout';\n\nexport const schema = {\n    direction: Layout.propTypes.direction.isRequired,\n    components: PropTypes.arrayOf(Component)\n};\n```\n\n`Layout` is React component. I am expecting to access `propTypes.direction` property of `Layout` component. This works in development environment. However, because `propTypes` are stripped in production, I am getting an error:\n\n> Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read property 'direction' of undefined(â€¦)\n\nThe only fix that I can think of in user land is adding a safe-check that eliminates the dead-code during the build stage, e.g.\n\n``` js\nexport const schema = __DEV__ ? {\n    direction: Layout.propTypes.direction.isRequired,\n    components: PropTypes.arrayOf(Component)\n} : null;\n```\n\nThis is sub-optimal, because it would require updating each instance where `propTypes` are used to declare data shapes.\n- Is there an environment variable that would force to keep `propTypes` but disable validation?\n- Can you suggest an alternative approach to this issue?\n",
