  "body": "Once the API stabilizes, we will move Schedule into a separate repo. To promote adoption, especially by projects outside the React ecosystem, we'll remove all React-isms from the source and keep it as simple as possible:\r\n\r\n- No build step.\r\n- No static types.\r\n- Everything is in a single file.\r\n\r\nIf we end up needing to support multiple targets, like CommonJS and ESM, we can still avoid a build step by maintaining two copies of the same file, but with different exports.\r\n\r\nThis commit also refactors the implementation to split out the DOM- specific parts (essentially a requestIdleCallback polyfill). Aside from the architectural benefits, this also makes it possible to write host-agnostic tests. If/when we publish a version of Schedule that targets other environments, like React Native, we can run these same tests across all implementations.",
