  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug, but maybe this is a question...\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIn chrome (and I'm sure other browsers), chrome extensions can mutate your DOM willy-nilly.  In turn, when React goes to update the node, we get a critical error (NotFoundError), if you don't have an Error boundary in place, your whole app blows up.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce**\r\n- Here is a fiddle with a simple phone number with a counter, it should work: https://jsfiddle.net/67htecf5/1/\r\n- Install the [Google Voice Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-voice-by-google/kcnhkahnjcbndmmehfkdnkjomaanaooo?hl=en)\r\n- Reload the fiddle once you enable the extension.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nNot sure honestly. It's annoying that the entire page crashes rather than, maybe throwing a warning type error and skipping the corrupt node (I'm afraid of the cascading effect this type of change might have).\r\n\r\nMaybe React shouldn't cater to this type of error, in that case, what can I do about it? I have added error boundaries and they help to track these issues down, but the amount of places I have to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is getting a bit absurd, and it's making it tricky for new feature development. At this rate I might as well just be setting any user input text as `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` but this doesn't seem like a good solution.\r\n\r\nIt's common enough that since I've added React 16 to my project, I've fixed about 10~15 different instances, and I find one or two each week right now. They do seem to be slowing down though, but I fear this will be an ongoing fight/maintenance issue.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16.0 - Previous version of react also had similar issues, but they didn't seem to crash like react 16 does. Thankfully react 16 does have error boundaries and is more predictable in how it handles.\r\nChrome latest",
