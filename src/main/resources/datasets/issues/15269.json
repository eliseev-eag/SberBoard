  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nbug\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nI'm trying to write a component that uses hooks. This component executes a request as an effect on component initial render with `useEffect`, and passing `[]` as its second param so the request only happens once. For some reason, in my test code, I can't this async call to resolve synchronously. I've made an [example repo](https://github.com/kyleholzinger/hooks-effect-bug-repro), but here are some code snippets so you don't have to navigate there! Here's the simple component I'm trying to render:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Component</summary>\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction TodoList() {\r\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([])\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    console.log('executing effect')\r\n    axios\r\n      .get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos')\r\n      .then((res) => {\r\n        console.log('unwrapping request')\r\n        return res.data\r\n      })\r\n      .then(setTodos)\r\n  }, [])\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      some things:\r\n      {todos.map((todo) => (\r\n        <div className=\"todo\" key={todo.id}>\r\n          {todo.title}\r\n        </div>\r\n      ))}\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Test code</summary>\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\ndescribe('<TodoList />', () => {\r\n  let wrapper\r\n\r\n  beforeEach(() => {\r\n    console.log('mounting component')\r\n    jest.useFakeTimers()\r\n    axiosMockInstance = new MockAdapter(axios)\r\n    axiosMockInstance\r\n      .onGet('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos')\r\n      .reply(200, [{ id: 1, title: 'a thing' }])\r\n    act(() => {\r\n      wrapper = mount(<TodoList />)\r\n      jest.runAllTimers()\r\n    })\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  afterEach(() => {\r\n    axiosMockInstance.restore()\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  it('calls its effect', () => {\r\n    console.log('in example:')\r\n    console.log(wrapper.debug())\r\n    const todos = wrapper.find('.todo').at(0)\r\n    console.log('this is a test')\r\n    expect(todos.text()).toBe(10)\r\n  })\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot of output when executing test</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![failing test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyleholzinger/hooks-effect-bug-repro/master/images/before.png)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nFrom my understanding of how everything is set up, I think that the combination of using `act` with `jest#runAllTimers` should be executing that effect as well as resolving the promise from axios within that `act` call, but it seems like the promise handlers are either not getting executed in time (I can't tell because jest intercepts logs), or if the component simply isn't rerendering after `setTodos` is executed. Sorry if this is a bit of a convoluted example, I couldn't find one much simpler! Also let me know if this should belong in jest or enzyme or something as well; I'm really unsure of where the bug lies. Thanks in advance for checking this out, I hope I can get this working! I've been really enjoying hooks so far üôè \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nreact: v16.8.6\r\nenzyme: 3.9.0",
