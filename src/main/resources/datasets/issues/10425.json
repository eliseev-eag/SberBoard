  "body": "This PR is a fix for #10388. It renames `renderToStream` to `renderToNodeStream` and `renderToStaticStream` to `renderToStaticNodeStream`.\r\n\r\nIt's basically just a find-and-replace job. Note that the fiber test results changed a **lot**, but I'm pretty sure after running them that they weren't up-to-date in master, so I'm not worrying about that.\r\n\r\nAlso, we should also merge the documentation pages `reference-react-dom-server.md` and `reference-react-dom-node-stream.md` before release, but I left that out of this PR as it is independent of this change.\r\n",
