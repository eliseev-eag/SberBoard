  "body": "I am currently doing an evaluation of React vs Angular for a new project and one criterion that we are looking at is performance (particularly on mobile devices).\n\nWe built prototypes in React and Angular and found that there we were seeing huge (2-3s) render times for a particular page which was basically just a huge list of prices. (~2000 prices) on React, but on Angular it was much quicker (~200ms).\n\nSo I distilled my prototype into two sample apps here. It is basically just rendering a list of 2000 numbers and printing them out as currencies.\n\nReact: https://github.com/pselden/react-render-test\nAngular: https://github.com/pselden/angular-render-test\n\nWhen running the React version, using the locale switcher took React around 200ms to re-render the entire list of 2000, while Angular was taking 30ms. I worked with the react-intl people and found out that the currency formatting is only consuming about 40ms of that time.\n\nSo I thought: \"well this test heavily favors React because basically every node has to be re-rendered when the locale changes\".\n\nSo I added a simple button/click counter to the top of the page and did some more measurements. React took an entire 117ms just to increment the click and re-render (almost the entirety of that was in the \"wasted\" section of React Perf tools). Angular took 5ms.\n\nSo clearly I must be doing something wrong -- react is being beaten handily by Angular in initial render, re-render of page, and incremental render. But everything looks very straightforward -- so what's the problem then?\n",
