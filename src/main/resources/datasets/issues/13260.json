  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nReport a Bug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nI have just come across what _looks_ like a bug with react reconciliation when rendering in a browser over an existing version of the same component (rendered on the server).\r\n\r\nThis appears to only happen in react and react-dom 16, I have tried 16.4.1, 16.4.0, and 16.0.0 and all display the same behaviour. Whereas react & react-dom 15 seem to work as expected.\r\n\r\nIf we take this (simple but rather contrived) component as an example:\r\n\r\nHeader.js\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport default (props) => {\r\n    const classes = `header--${props.name}`;\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className={classes}>\r\n            <p>{props.name}</p>\r\n        </div>);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen server side render it like so: \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport {renderToString} from 'react';\r\nimport Header from '../Header';\r\n\r\nrenderToString(<Header name=\"leonardo\" />);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe get something like the below:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"the-mount\">\r\n    <div class=\"header--leonardo\"}>\r\n        <p>leonardo</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, later, in the browser:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport ReactDom from 'react-dom';\r\nimport Header from '../Header';\r\n\r\nconst mount = document.getElementById('the-mount');\r\nReactDom.render(<Header name=\"donatello\" />, mount);\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe component updates to:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"the-mount\">\r\n    <div class=\"header--leonardo\"}>\r\n        <p>donatello</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote, the class value has not changed despite being driven by the same prop as the `<p>` content which _has_ updated, and so is now incorrect.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would expect to see the following after the render call in the browser:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"the-mount\">\r\n    <div class=\"header--donatello\"}>\r\n        <p>donatello</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI can replicate this in multiple versions of react and react-dom 16, however I see the expected behaviour in 15.\r\n",
