  "body": "My mental model is that we have a polyfill layer (`ReactDOMInput`) to support what the browser would support, and will support in the future once these ideas propagate through the standards. The fact that it is currently implemented as a wrapper should be an unobservable implementation detail, and perhaps it shouldn't be implemented as a wrapper.\n\nAs an upgrade path we would need to monkey patch existing legacy methods (`props`, `setProps`, `getDOMNode`) onto it as an upgrade path. These would work but immediately warn when used.\n\n`setProps` will be replaced by some other imperative layer, or simply multiple calls to `React.render`.\n\n`component.getDOMNode` is being replaced by `React.findDOMNode(component)` which can take either an arbitrary component or a DOM node directly. So you can use it on something that you're unsure about. In most cases, you can simply get rid of the call all together and use the DOM ref directly.\n",
