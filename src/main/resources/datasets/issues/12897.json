  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nThis is a question.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThe error boundary successfully intercepts the JavaScript errors and displays our fallback UI but it seems the JavaScript errors still gets thrown; they appear in red in the browser's console and they are caught in our Cypress tests, making them fail.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI don't know, that's what I'm asking. Does the Error Boundary throw the original JS error again? Or it lets JS throw it as it would normally do? Or does the Error Boundary catches the original thrown error and then prints it using `console.error`? _What is the designed behaviour for the Error Boundary regarding the original JavaScript thrown error?_\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nI use Google Chrome `Version 66.0.3359.181 (Official Build) (64-bit)` and React 16.3.2",
