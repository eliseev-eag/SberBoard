  "body": "hi, everyone:\n  we are planing to rebuild our project using React, we tried to use `reactify` to translate jsx, gulp to pack up js files, but there are 2 problems:\n1. using watchify in gulp, when we change our code, it will take about 15 seconds to repack, feeling terrible.\n2. we need to using breakpoints in js file, we used `vinyl-source-stream` in gulp file , and Chrome is able to split the packed js file to raw files(in developer tools->sources tab), but, in some case, there are something wrong with raw files, breakpoints will not work, more seriously, the error info(in developer tools->console tab) is obvious marked at wrong line.\n\nwe also tried `webpack` with`webpack-dev-server`, but we cannot find a proper config.\n\nso, please share any idea about debug a project based on React.\n\nthanks a lot!\n",
