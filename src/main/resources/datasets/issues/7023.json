  "body": "When writing out propTypes to ensure the accuracy of my components it is sometimes necessary that a component _not_ receive a particular prop as it may cause problems with the component receiving props or lead to other confusion. I suggest the following:\n\n```\nMyComponent.propTypes = {\n  onChange: React.PropTypes.deny\n}\n```\n\nwhich would then output a warning like:\n\n`Warning: Failed propType: prop 'onChange' was specified in 'MyComponent' and should not be used. Check the render method of 'MyComponentParent'.`\n",
