  "body": "All the way at the very bottom of the [Reusable Components](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#stateless-functions) page there is a section on Stateless Functions. Below that section is a note:\n\n> In an ideal world, most of your components would be stateless functions because in the future weâ€™ll also be able to make performance optimizations specific to these components by avoiding unnecessary checks and memory allocations. **This is the recommended pattern, when possible.**\n\n_(emphasis mine)_\n\nIf this is indeed the recommended pattern, it should be made much, much more prominent. For example by using it in the `A Simple Component` section on the homepage. That now has this `HelloMessage` component as the visitor's very first example of a React component:\n\n``` js\nvar HelloMessage = React.createClass({\n  render: function() {\n    return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis function qualifies for being a stateless function component:\n\n``` js\nfunction HelloMessage(props) {\n    return <div>Hello {props.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\nAs a bonus, it's now much, much simpler and postpones introduction of `React.createClass` to later, when the examples go more in-depth.\n\nLet's start teaching people the right patterns.\n",
