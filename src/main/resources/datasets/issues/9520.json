  "body": "React binds the 'this' keyword of event handler functions to 'null' explicitly. But what I have noticed is, it calls the function associated with 'onChange' event with 'this' as  'undefined' .For other events such as 'onClick' , 'onBlur' the value of 'this' is bound to 'null' as usual. But there is no extra call to make 'this' as 'undefined' in the associated handler function. What could be the reason for this ? Is this a bug ? . Although both 'null' and 'undefined' are not of any use to the developer as we have to bind it explicitly.\r\n\r\nHere's the link for the code on jsfiddle :\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/nikhilgoyal104ah4/69z2wepo/76915/\r\n\r\n\r\n",
