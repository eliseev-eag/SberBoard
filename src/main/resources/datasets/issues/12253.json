It also schedules a `setTimeout` call to ensure that callbacks with timeouts get called.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [ ] create two entry points, one that writes to global and one that doesn't\r\n- [ ] See if we can detect native rIC implementations and warn when people do the wrong thing\r\n- [ ] figure out the actual name for the package\r\n- [ ] figure out the correct build config for `rollup/bundles.js` (probably don't need prod/dev builds?)\r\n- [ ] determine the final API <sup>[1](#apifootnote)</sup>\r\n- [ ] remove the previous polyfill from `ReactDOMFrameScheduling` and import this one\r\n     - [ ] Depending on this answer, potentially re-export the native `requestIdleCallback` if it exists\r\n\r\n________\r\n\r\n<a name=\"apifootnote\">1</a>: For example, should it export `requestIdleCallback` or write to `window`?",
