If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!\n3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.\n4. Ensure the test suite passes (`grunt test`).\n5. Make sure your code lints (`grunt lint`) - we've done our best to make sure these rules match our internal linting guidelines.\n6. If you haven't already, complete the [CLA](https://code.facebook.com/cla).\n\nTo demonstrate multiple arguments `bind(this, arg1, arg2, ...)`, also not to pass in more than what `handleClick` needed, namely props, or maybe even just pass single item itself, etc.\nGoing to change the kor file after review.\n",
