  "body": "Articles in Add-Ons have incorrect Prev Next links. For example the first `Performance Tools` has Prev link to the `Keyed Fragments` which is actually the fourth. `Immutability Helpers` does not have Prev Next links at all. I think the easiest way is just to remove the Prev Next links from Add-Ons articles. It will allow to add/update/remove articles without need to update Prev/Next links. What do you think?",
