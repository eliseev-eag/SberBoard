  "body": "This PR addresses issue #11570, which rewords the warning message \"invalid DOM property\" to be less obnoxious.\r\n\r\nI tried to avoid making the warning message too long, and focused on 3 points.\r\n1) The reason the warning was displayed? ` Invalid DOM property `class`.`\r\n2) Why? `In React, all properties should be camelCased to avoid issues with JavaScript reserved words, such as \"class\".`\r\n3) How can I fix it? `Did you mean `tabIndex`?`\r\n\r\nIt could be expanded more by adding the exceptions to the rule as well which are `data-*` and `aria-*` attributes, or mentioning that the camel-case naming convention also helps to avoid confusion between HTML attributes.\r\n",
