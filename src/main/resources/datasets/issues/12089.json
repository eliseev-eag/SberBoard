  "body": "Relates to PR #12083\r\n\r\nCurrently we double-invoke component `constructor`, `render`, `static getDerivedStateFromProps` and `setState` reducer functions if the `debugRenderPhaseSideEffects` feature flag is on. We should also do this if we're inside of a `StrictMode` subtree.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is likely that the new `StrictMode` element will be present in production apps, so I believe it is important that it not negatively impact performance.\r\n\r\nStrict warnings (like all warnings) only impact dev mode, but up until now the double-invoked lifecycles impact both dev and prod. This is actually a good thing at Facebook, since it helps us identify potential bugs in production and we can easily limit it to only impact developers, but I think it would complicate the story for external users because of the negative performance impact.\r\n\r\nI propose that we continue to observe the `debugRenderPhaseSideEffects` flag for dev and prod (since this impacts Facebook only) but only double-invoke for \"strict\" mode in dev.\r\n\r\nEnabling this behavior greatly complicates our incremental rendering tests ([see below](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12089#issuecomment-360517198) so I will also be converting these to be internal so they can explicitly override the feature-flag before running. I think this is okay since the tests that break all use the noop-renderer which is not published to NPM.",
