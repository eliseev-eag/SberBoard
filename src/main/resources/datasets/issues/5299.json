  "body": "This should fix the issues with shallow rendering and `_owner` mentioned in #5292. Assertions around the equality of component children expect `_owner` to be `null`, but shallow rendering was setting a real `_owner`.\n\nThe test case I provided is based on the failure mentioned in #5292. Setting the component body directly still worked with the original `NoopInternalComponent`, and using simpler children didn't require the full fix - that's why the component is kind of unusual :)\n\nI've seen similar issues when composing (functional) components, but there's a secondary issue there around the component's `type` that I can submit a separate issue and PR for.\n",
