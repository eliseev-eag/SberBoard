  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug!\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen rendering an `input` element of type `checkbox` with an `onClick` and `onChange` handler, `onChange` is still called even though `event.preventDefault()` is called in the `onClick` handler.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\r\n\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/rf3w7apc/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nCalling `event.preventDefault` in the `onClick` handler should prevent the default action  from occurring (or undo its effect), which is to update the value of the `input` element. This should stop any `change` event listener from being invoked. See https://jsfiddle.net/L1eskzsq/ for expected behavior\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nTested using a build from master, macOS 10.12.2, verified in:\r\n\r\n* Chrome  56.0.2924.87 (64-bit)\r\n* Firefox 51.0.1 (64-bit)\r\n\r\nSafari 10.0.2 calls the `change` event listener in both cases.\r\n",
