  "body": "Just a quick patch to get the discussion started. \r\n\r\nThe warning reads:\r\n\r\n```\r\nReact loaded in DEV mode. See https://fb.me/react-dev-mode for more details\r\n```\r\n\r\n- I'm not sure this is the best place to add this. Other warnings are present in the file, and it's inside  `isomorphic`, so I made the decision based on that\r\n- I decided not to use the built-in `warning` utility because I don't need any conditions. Thoughts?\r\n  - Are we supporting environments where `console.log` should be checked for?\r\n- Jest will output these warnings during tests. I've seen in other parts of the codebase there are checks for it that look like this. I decided not to include it because it's pretty verbose, but please let me know if I should change it\r\n  ```js\r\n  if (\r\n    typeof process !== 'undefined' &&\r\n    process.env &&\r\n    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test'\r\n  ) {\r\n    // â€¦\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n- My suggestion is to create a page / redirection from `https://fb.me/react-dev-mode` to a place where some notes are collected around:\r\n  - How to get rid of the warning\r\n  - What the differences are between dev mode and prod mode\r\n  - Tips for benchmark authors and perhaps an example of what's considered a useful benchmark\r\n    - Perhaps useful links to articles like [this one](https://medium.com/@localvoid/how-to-win-in-web-framework-benchmarks-8bc31af76ce7#.defwxx2re)",
