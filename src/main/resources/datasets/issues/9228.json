  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThe react based product we developed works fine with other browsers. But when it comes to IE most of the times the Apphangb1 error occurs with not responsive page. The page is already loaded but whole page (buttons, text field, etc) is hung.\r\n\r\nThe error occurs more frequently for https connections. For http and direct connections (when connected to local host machine using ip) the error frequency is very low. There is no any error output in the console at this time. However since the browser's dev tool also hangs there is no way to dig deep into the problem.\r\n\r\nIs there any possibility that this kind of a condition can occur due to the way react is implemented? If so is there any workaround to overcome it?",
