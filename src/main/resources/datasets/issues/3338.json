JSX sets this value automatically; see JSX in Depth.\"\n\n`JSX in Depth` is a link to http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#react-composite-components which is seemingly a non-existent anchor on the JSX in Depth page.\n\nIt would be good to have that link to somewhere actually documenting the auto-setting of displayName. I'm not sure where that is, or if it even still exists, which is why I didn't do it myself...\n",
