  "body": "http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html#updating-componentdidupdate is unclear on when it is called with regards to the `render` function.\n\nThe docs state that it's \"Invoked immediately after updating occurs\" but it is unclear what is meant with updating in this case: it can refer to either the component as a whole updating (meaning post-render), or it can refer to setState() having been processed (which might mean pre-render).\n\nIt would be good to explicitly state when this function fires in its documentation (even if somewhere else on the site this is described in text or graphic form already).\n",
