  "body": "At the beginning of an interactive browser event (events that fire as the result of a user interaction, like a click), check for pending updates that were scheduled in a previous interactive event. Flush the pending updates synchronously so that the event handlers are up-to-date before responding to the current event.\r\n\r\nWe now have three classes of events:\r\n\r\n- Controlled events. Updates are always flushed synchronously.\r\n- Interactive events. Updates are async, unless a subsequent event is fired before it can complete, as described above. They are also slightly higher priority than a normal async update.\r\n- Non-interactive events. These are treated as normal, low-priority async updates.",
