  "body": "Looking at the CPU profile for a React app in Chrome, I get 65 layers deep into React without ever reaching my own code:\n<img width=\"818\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-11-12 at 12 31 47 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/98301/11125776/bb823ace-8939-11e5-85a9-f720e571d1d5.png\">\n\nWith every layer, I lose a little bit of performance. These deep call stacks also make it difficult to debug which parts of _my_ code need more work.\n1. Is this expected behavior? While this is a debug build of React, I don't see anything different in the production version. The call stacks are just as deep, only the names of the functions are mangled.\n2. Is it possible to inline some of these function calls for production React?\n\nI can't say whether this is genuinely a performance issue, but it certainly makes debugging performance issues unpleasant.\n\nI'm on React 0.14.0.\n",
