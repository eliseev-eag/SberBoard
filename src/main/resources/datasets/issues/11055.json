Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n[v15.x react-test-renderer/shallow](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/v15.6.1/packages/react-test-renderer/shallow.js) runs happily, [the check and error throw appears to be new in v16.x](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/v16.0.0/packages/react-test-renderer/shallow.js#L3-L5)\r\n\r\nRelated: [7231 comment](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7231#issuecomment-236370277) had a response of \r\n>There should be no difference...between dev and prod versions of React. \r\n\r\nwhich is great news in terms of react üëç  but disallowing prod version of shallow render doesn't cover the prod code path of other libraries/dependencies üôè ",
