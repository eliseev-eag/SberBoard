  "body": "Possible bug, I have created this JS Fiddle:\nhttp://jsbin.com/piqolixixi/edit?html,css,js,output\n\nOn desktop if i click anywhere (on the components or outside of the components) I get the \"Clicked!\" alert - which is expected, as on mount I have registered the click event `onClick` in the `Hello` component.\n\nIf I try the same thing on a ios touch device (im using an ipad mini model A1432, ios 9.3.2)\nThe click events are not triggered when i touch the react components (`Hello` and `HelloOther`).\nBut if I touch outside of the components the alert comes up.\n\nWhats interesting is that if i add `cursor: pointer;` css to the components they will then get triggered.\nLooks like its some sort of regression around this issue:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/2055\n\nI have tried react versions 0.14 to 15.x - same issue\n",
