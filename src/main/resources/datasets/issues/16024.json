  "body": "Builds on top of #16007.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to `tail=\"collapsed\"` except it hides all rows in the tail. The added complexity here is that sometimes we only know that we've hit the tail after we've already rendered this row. So we need undo the effects added by rendering the row.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, by not committing the boundary, there's nothing to retry. So we need to transfer the promise set to the list so that we get a retry if the only thing to ping was in the tail.",
