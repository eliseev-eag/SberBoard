  "body": "Follow up to #9673\r\n\r\nRename ReactServer -> ReactDOMServerStream This file is going to be the replacement for ReactDOMServer.\r\n\r\nI mock ReactDOMServer and user ReactDOMServerStream when we have the fiber flag enabled. I'm now also enabling this as the default for distributions builds (react-dom/server on npm and react-dom-server.production.min.js as umd bundle).\r\n\r\nI'm using traverseStackChildren instead of traverseAllChildren because traverseAllChildren is now only in the isomorphic package and we don't want to build all of that that into the server package.\r\n\r\nI also have to require lower case react for the builds to work.\r\n\r\nI also pulled in two commits from #9580 which fixes ReactDOMServer in Fiber mode, which fixed tests we're no longer testing (the injection) and fixes some assertions in Fiber mode to ensure that we pass a proper amount of tests.\r\n\r\nTest Plan: Tested the SSR fixture.",
