  "body": "Proper implementation of #1512\n\nIt does not get rid of `MUST_USE_PROPERTY` (see #2140, #2202) and `MUST_USE_ATTRIBUTE` because I'm not 100% sure if we might want to use it or not, but I assume there's no need for it.\n\nI also removed a test that I'm not sure what to do about. It relied on really hacky behavior and I don't really see a simple way of keeping it alive (not really familiar with testing), but please shout if you think otherwise.\n\nThis is beneficial for a lot of reasons, one being that we ensure DOM attributes always reflect the intended value. `MUST_USE_PROPERTY` was previously used for some attributes not supported by all browsers/elements, which when updated would just add a custom property to the node object rather than the intended attribute.\n\nHalf-related: #1848 and #1657\n",
