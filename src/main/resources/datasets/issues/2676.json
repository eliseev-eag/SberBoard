  "body": "I'm currently implementing drag-and-drop in a React application where different kinds of data is dragged and dropped. This means I want to check for certain types on the event.dataTransfer object to see if drop should be enabled or not. Basically it looks like this:\n\n``` javascript\nonDragOver: function (event) {\n    if (event.dataTransfer.types.indexOf('application/x-custom-type') > -1) {\n        event.preventDefault();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis works fine in Chrome, but less so in Firefox. It turns out that in Firefox the type of DataTransfer.types is DOMStringList, which does not have an `indexOf` method. According to the latest drafts of the HTML5 specification ([W3C](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/editing.html#the-datatransfer-interface), [WHATWG](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#dom-datatransfer-types)), returning an array like Webkit does is correct. Obviously, the fix is easy on my side (check which one of `indexOf` and `contains` is available and use that one), but I thought it might be useful to fix this in React instead, since it is at least related to the event system.\n\nI could probably take a stab at this, but I wanted to gauge the interest. Perhaps the DataTransfer object is deemed to be out of scope for the synthetic event handler.\n",
