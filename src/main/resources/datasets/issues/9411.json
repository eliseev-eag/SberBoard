  "body": "Now we are moving to React 16, I'm surprised that there are zero change in context(and it remains experimental and possibly break in the future). Libraries like react-redux and  react-router  heavily depends on using context, because it is experimental, shouldCompomentUpdate and pureComponent will not check context at all. That causes some extra work to be done just to make react-router working with react-redux(like you have to wrap every component with withRouter to map context to props). And to me, it is not beautiful.\r\n\r\nCan we formally accept context as the solution and let API take it into consideration or just find a better solution in the next version of React ?\r\n",
