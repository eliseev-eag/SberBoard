  "body": "In [step 4](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/docs/docs/thinking-in-react.md#step-4-identify-where-your-state-should-live) of the Thinking in React example, the `ProductTable` component filters and displays an array of products based on user input.\r\n\r\nI am unsure why the code for filtering the products is in the `ProductTable` component and not the `FilterableProductTable` component. The same question was [previously raised](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8035#issuecomment-269130572)  in issue #8035.\r\n\r\nI think having `FilterableProductTable` be responsible for filtering the products would improve the example for two reasons:\r\n\r\n* Allow `ProductTable` to be used outside of `FilterableProductTable`\r\n* Better separate the concerns of filtering the products from displaying the products\r\n\r\nI [updated the example](https://github.com/danielsbird/react/commit/2869b01314713b53fd39aedefa1693d4042d348c) and I'm happy to submit a PR if this is something that should be changed.",
