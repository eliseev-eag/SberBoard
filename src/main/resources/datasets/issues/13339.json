  "body": "Fixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12481.\r\n\r\nIt's a small behavior change but the old behavior both had a warning (in which case we don't provide strong guarantees) *and* was inconsistent with other similar attributes. The old behavior was also unintuitive.\r\n\r\nParticularly, this relaxes the restriction on `<svg focusable>` to accept booleans. It's an enumerated attribute with `'true'`, `'false'`, and `'auto'` values. This makes it consistent with how we already handle the HTML `draggable` attribute (which also has `'true'`, `'false'`, and `'auto'` values).\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"836\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-08-07 at 10 07 58 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/43766663-fbe1b2de-9a2a-11e8-8583-dca9ae28d1ca.png\">\r\n<img width=\"843\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-08-07 at 10 08 19 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/43766665-fc1ac3b2-9a2a-11e8-9e5f-a5c8817554ee.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"434\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-08-07 at 10 09 06 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/43766677-0207d526-9a2b-11e8-83ed-2d0edb194f26.png\">\r\n<img width=\"452\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-08-07 at 10 08 58 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/43766683-06576e3e-9a2b-11e8-892c-7901c34425af.png\">\r\n\r\nThere's no behavior change for cases that didn't warn.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find other attributes like this except `syncMaster` (which seems very niche?) so I'm not worried about this list growing.",
