  "body": "I want to create a lib that allows a function `strand` to let users create react elements with either of the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstrand('div') // equal to `React.createElement('div', null)`\r\nstrand('div')('child text') // equal to `React.createElement('div', null, 'child text')`\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, I tried the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst strand = tag => Object.assign(\r\n  (...children) => React.createElement(tag, null, ...children),\r\n  React.createElement(tag, null)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis creates a callable element object (or should).\r\n\r\nIf––as you're reading this issue––you're wondering \"this is an obnoxious, costly implementation\", don't worry, it'll get compiled down... this is just a runtime/in-dev version of my project. Very hacky... but I'd still like to get it working.\r\n\r\nHere's the problem I run into:\r\n\r\n`Functions are not valid as a React child. This may happen if you return a Component instead of <Component /> from render. Or maybe you meant to call this function rather than return it.`\r\n\r\n^ I'm guessing that the internals of React are checking to see if it's a function... instead of only checking the $$typeof symbol prop that gets copied over via the `Object.assign` call? Is there any way around this? I'd really like to see this come to life!\r\n\r\nThank you for giving this issue a read, & hopefully there's a solution :)\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nHarry",
