  "body": "@dieppe worked on making `ResponderEventPlugin` work with DOM in #4303 but this was put on hold.\nAfter #6338 brings all the relevant files into React repo, we can start thinking about it again.\n\nIâ€™m creating this issue to keep track of whether we want this to happen or not, and what is our plan regarding this. If there is a consensus, we can look into rebasing #4303.\n\ncc @sebmarkbage @jordwalke \n",
