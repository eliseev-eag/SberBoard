  "body": "Using version 16.8.3.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that this is a bug, but according to http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/ which is linked to from the React docs, it appears that anytime `componentDidUpdate` is called, it only reached that point in the lifecycle by first passing through `shouldComponentUpdate`. This has always been the case for me, as far as I've noticed. But I am debugging a component now where this is not the case and it is very confusing. \r\n\r\nIs this a bug? Surely it must be possible within the React codebase, because it is happening - but under what circumstances should this happen?\r\n",
