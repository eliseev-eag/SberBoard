  "body": "There was already an issue open for this, however, it has been locked: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16500\r\n\r\nI'm only opening a new issue to add some additional information as the current outcome isn't ideal. I work for a very large sports apparel company out of Baltimore with various applications of varying age.\r\n\r\nSome of our newer applications are running react@latest, however, we still have many legacy applications on 0.14.7. While we're working to replace these, the EOL for many is still at least a year out.\r\n\r\nAccording to the [last post](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16500#issuecomment-525022121) by @gaearon, the solution is to install the 3.x version. This is not ideal since we're still also working on react@latest - switching between extension versions is not manageable. \r\n\r\nIdeally, instead of a better error message, React Dev Tools 4.x just wouldn't [throw](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/b438699d3620bff236282b049204e1221b3689e9/packages/react-devtools-shared/src/backend/legacy/renderer.js#L264) at all for 0.14.x. Currently it breaks the application when Dev Tools is open (I use Chrome); I'd rather at least have console and Redux dev tools when I have to work on our legacy apps than nothing at all!\r\n\r\nIt's perfectly understandable that support for 0.14.x was nixed, but should the latest version break legacy React applications? Just because I have Chrome Dev Tools open doesn't mean I intend to use React Dev Tools, but with the latest extension I can't use Chrome Dev Tools at all, so perhaps it makes more sense just to display the error in the React Dev Tools tab?",
