  "body": "In order to support the upcoming [`react-lifecycles-compat` module](https://github.com/reactjs/react-lifecycles-compat) and various edge-cases that are possible when considering eg class inheritance and other React-like libraries, this PR makes the following changes:\r\n* If a component defines `static getDerivedStateFromProps`, React will not invoke any of the following instance methods: `componentWillMount`, `componentWillReceiveProps`, and `componentWillUpdate`.\r\n* If React detects that a component has been polyfilled by `react-lifecycles-compat` (based on the presence of a `__suppressDeprecationWarning` flag) it will suppress both deprecation and unsafe lifecycle warnings. (Those lifecycles won't be executed anyway, and in this case it can be assumed the lifecycles only exist for backwards compatibility purposes.)\r\n\r\nAll affected tests have been updated and some new ones have been added.\r\n\r\nI have left a TODO comment in a few tests to replace an inline approximation of the new polyfill with the _actual_ module once it's been published.",
