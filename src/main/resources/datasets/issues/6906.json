  "body": "Since React 0.14 the tree-diffing and DOM rendering is decoupled, paving the way to projects like https://github.com/Flipboard/react-canvas\n\nIs there a way to give the tree-diffing algorithm clues about which operations are fast and which are slow?\n- Suppose I have fictitious draw-model where just updating a certain property in a node is much more expensive than recreating the entire node. Can I tell react this?\n- Or that I have situation where I switch `A` for `B` but have a really easy way to \"repurpose\" `A` to become `B`.\n",
