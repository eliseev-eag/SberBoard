  "body": "This pull request adds a new `--sync-opensource` command to the rollup build script.\r\n\r\nThis differs from `--sync-fbsource`, because it tries to sync to this path:\r\n\r\n    {PROVIDED PATH}/xplat/js/react-native-github/Libraries/Renderer/\r\n\r\nWhile `--sync-opensource` will sync to:\r\n\r\n    {PROVIDED PATH}/Libraries/Renderer/\r\n\r\nThis will make it easier for OSS users to update the React Native renderer to an alpha version of React for testing/tinkering. (Not recommended to send the RN repo bug reports as a result of doing this, however!)\r\n\r\nUsage is like this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n> yarn build --sync-opensource=/path/to/react-native --type=RN_OSS\r\n```",
