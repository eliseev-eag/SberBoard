  "body": "This fixes #3726\n\nRather than checking for `HTMLUnknownElement`, it checks to see if there's a `React.DOM` factory for that tag. This will throw false negatives for non-standard elements but that seems like it might be preferable to instantiating elements and checking for `HTMLUnknownElement` (possible, but PhantomJS 1.9 doesn't support it, so we wouldn't get a test case). If you disagree, I can change it.\n\nWe might consider renaming `validateDangerousTag` to something like `validateTag`.\n",
