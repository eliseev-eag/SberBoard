  "body": "I've been having issues installing `react` as of today. I've been using:\n- react `0.12.2`\n-  node `0.10.35` \n- switched between using `npm` at version `1.4.28` and `2.1.17`\n- performed an npm cache clear\n\nWhen I try to start my app, I get:\n\n```\njstransform dependency mismatch: esprima-fb from /test_app/node_modules/react/node_modules/envify/node_modules/jstransform/node_modules/esprima-fb (expected: ~7001.0001.0000-dev-harmony-fb, got: 7001.1.0-dev-harmony-fb)\n```\n\nIt seems that the leading 0s on the version numbers are being truncated as when I check the `version` field in the `package.json` of `esprima-fb`, it reads:\n\n`7001.1.0-dev-harmony-fb`\n\nI'm unsure if this is an `npm` registry issue or not, but was wondering if anyone had any insight into how to fix the issue (as I've spent many hours trying to get this to work).\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso tried\n\n``` bash\n$ npm cache clean\n$ npm cache add esprima-fb@7001.0001.0000-dev-harmony-fb\n$ npm cache ls esprima-fb\n~/.npm/esprima-fb/esprima-fb/\n~/.npm/esprima-fb/esprima-fb/7001.1.0-dev-harmony-fb/\n~/.npm/esprima-fb/esprima-fb/7001.1.0-dev-harmony-fb/package/\n~/.npm/esprima-fb/esprima-fb/7001.1.0-dev-harmony-fb/package.tgz\n~/.npm/esprima-fb/esprima-fb/7001.1.0-dev-harmony-fb/package/package.json\n```\n",
