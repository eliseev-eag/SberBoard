  "body": "This disables the RAF scheduler impl in favor of the MessageLoop one, which we've found better utilizes CPU. Unlike https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/16271, this keeps the RAF implementation for now just in case, but it's only in one specially marked test.\r\n\r\nThis matches what we already rolled out in www, except the rAF-specific flags (they're true on www but they're dead code in the rAF path anyway â€” and I didn't want to adjust the test for them).\r\n\r\nMy previous PR includes most of the extra test coverage for ML scheduler which I picked up from Andrew's earlier PR.",
