  "body": "It used to be gated by `__DEV__`.\r\n\r\nWith GCC, a static feature flag set to `__DEV__` for open source bundles is just as good. Internally, this lets us experiment with enabling it in production for a subset of users (at the cost of shipping larger bundles at FB).\r\n\r\nThe diff is best read with `?w=1` because most of this is whitespace:\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11449/files?w=1\r\n\r\nI just converted it to named exports, and put the body of each function into a `ReactFeatureFlags.enableUserTimingAPI` check. Internally this points to a dynamic module that can change at runtime.",
