  "body": "Many people to understand something new are reading docs/articles, but good practice is to explore examples in parallel.\r\n\r\nCurrent examples' issues:\r\n - Depends on Babel 5.8.\r\n - `<script type=\"text/babel\">` - deprecated.\r\n - `setInterval(render, 50)` - to wait dom.\r\n - Outdated libraries (like webcomponentsjs 0.7).\r\n - Generally, you must 'parse' in mind the whole `html` file to understand how small Component works.\r\n\r\nFor me, possible solution could be rewriting examples as separate modules with own `package.json`, README, etc., with simple `npm start`, `npm build` scripts.\r\n\r\nIf it can be useful, I could make a PR in a few days.\r\n",
