  "body": "Jasmine can select single specs to run by using url parameter like `?spec=environment%2F__tests__%2FReactWebWorker-test`.\nNote that it compares the beginning of string, so each spec's file path is most important, later substring doesn't work.\n\nWhen debugging remotely with other browsers this would help too, as the whole test suite takes quite some time to run and there are a lot of logging to go through. Perhaps one could forward the spec param to test/index.html, or even better allow substrings by forwarding some other param from grunt (similarly to debug in https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/4f57515/grunt/config/webdriver-all.js#L35-L37) and conditionally checking for it in \nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/4f57515/test/lib/jasmine-execute.js#L7 so that if param is missing, use that default specFilter, but if param is there, filter manually by returning `spec.getFullName().indexOf(param) != -1`.\n\nTo prevent skipped specs being logged and posted back to server one can filter for `'# SKIP'` around here, for example https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/4f57515/test/lib/reportTestResults.browser.js#L12-L16 \n\n/cc @subtleGradient \n",
