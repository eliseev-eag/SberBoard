  "body": "The strategy of finding the \"current\" through the back pointers turned out to be inefficient. You basically have to scan from the top to find them since the return pointer is active even when a child is in `progressedChild` instead of `child`.\n\nisMounted is pretty easy though since we can just cut off the return pointer when a child gets deleted.\n\nThe key realization to fix findDOMNode is the realization that it doesn't matter which one is current if there is no pending insertion / previous deletion. So we can just check for those to determine if we're looking in the wrong tree.\n\nI'm not too worried about this being understandable unless we have other use cases for \"reflection\" that are less deprecated.\n\nAlso note two new features: findDOMNode in fragment returns first child rather than error/null. Just like element.querySelector. findDOMNode when a component returns a string, finds the host text node. This is the first time you could get access to a text node instance. It's not super great since if the text node merges (due to normalization) then it could actually represent multiple text nodes, but maybe that's fine. Seems useful.\n",
