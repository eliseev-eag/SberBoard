  "body": "This adds:\r\n\r\n* `react-dom/unstable-fire` entry point\r\n* `react-dom/src/fire` folder which is where we'll put the implementation files\r\n* A new host config in `react-dom/src/fire/ReactFireHostConfig`. Currently it just re-exports the old one, but you can verify it works by uncommenting the `console.log` in there.\r\n* A new entry in `bundles.js`, `forks.js`, and a new inlining alias `react-reconciler/inline.fire` for our host config. This also means there's `yarn flow fire` now.\r\n* A new entry point in `react-dom/src/fire/ReactFire`. It is a copy-paste of `ReactDOM` entry point with fixed relative paths. Its main purpose it just to show that the setup works â€” we'll fully replace the actual content later. Importantly, it references `react-reconciler/inline.fire`.\r\n* Running `yarn test-fire` and `yarn test-fire-prod` now stubs `react-dom` with `react-dom/unstable-fire`. You can verify this by commenting out `console.log`s in the Fire host config and in the Fire entry point.\r\n* There's a new fixture now. To get it working you'd need to run `yarn build react/index,fire --type=UMD_DEV`.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR is merged we can rebase @trueadm's initial work on top.\r\n\r\nNote: I decided to go with `ReactFire` rather than `ReactDOMFire` because we already know it's DOM and Dominic feels it's already getting too verbose for his taste. :P ",
