This generally means that you are using server rendering and the markup generated on the server was not what the client was expecting. React injected new markup to compensate which works but you have lost many of the benefits of server rendering. Instead, figure out why the markup being generated is different on the client or server:\r\n (client) ound-position:center;\" data-reactid=\"2\">\r\n (server) ound-position:center\" data-reactid=\"2\"><\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the browser is adding the semicolon or if react is skipping it on the server.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nWe should not get any warning, markup from client and server should match.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n15.4.2\r\nChrome / Linux\r\nFirefox / Linux\r\n",
