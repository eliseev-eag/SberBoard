  "body": "My 1.4.0-beta1 instance of React is an empty object. During installation, I ran into problems with `npm install` because of errors surrounding `\"eslint-plugin-react-internal\": \"file:eslint-rules\"`, as in it doesn't exist in the npm package registry. I deleted it from the package.json and everything ran smoothly from there. But each instance of React now is an empty object. I'm using linux version 14.04. My app's build pipeline includes gulp and commonjs\n",
