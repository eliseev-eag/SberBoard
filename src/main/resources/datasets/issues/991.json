  "body": "Continuation of: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/934\n\nThis is just a proof-of-concept, so the code is far from nice. It generates monotonic IDs prefixed with the `rootID` and store the full representation internally. It's currently a very simple implementation.\n\nIt's possible to get rid of `reactIDtoMountID`. It would also be possible to use the `mountID` as the internal ID as well and only use the concatenated ID where necessary, but even that isn't strictly necessary as the concatenated ID could be replaced with a `mountID` to `parentMountID` map (I believe would work and suffice).\n\nIf I understood @petehunt correctly, this (or with minor changes) should work for server-rendering as well, and uniqueness is guaranteed by the use of the `rootID` prefix (at least to the degree we guarantee it today).\n\nAgain, just a proof-of-concept, but I figure it's easier to get the discussion started this way. :)\n\nI have it compiled and running here: http://dev.cetrez.com/jsx/2/react/\n",
