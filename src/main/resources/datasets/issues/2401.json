  "body": "Apologies in advance if this is the wrong way to start this discussion, but I couldn't find a more suitable forum or ML to discuss this on...\n\nNow that tagged template strings will be part of ES6, is there any reason other than back compat to not deprecate the .jsx language extension and use template strings?\n\nI may be oversimplifying it, but it seems the upgrade path for users would be to replace things of the format:\n\n```\n<text>\n```\n\nwith\n\n```\njsx`<text>`\n```\n\nUnifying jsx with ES6 would help save effort to make tools intended to work with js work with jsx. For example, over in JSHint and JSCS (both are popular static analysis tools), there have been several tickets about jsx support, which we're happy to field. However, IMO, these efforts would be better spent getting tools ready for ES6 instead. I know FB's own `esprima-fb` have been contributing back to the upstream `esprima`, which is awesome, but focusing in on ES6 will help speed up those efforts. \n\nHopefully, React's recent move to get closer to the ES6 class syntax is a sign that this proposal will be seriously and thoughtfully considered. \n",
