  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nBug\n\nLooking at the documentation here: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/multiple-components.html#ownership it describes the difference between a parent/child relationship compared to an owner/ownee relationship. \n\nIn the tutorial here: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html#using-props It talks about the parent/child relationship when it should be an owner/ownee relationship.\n\nIs the owner/ownee terminology commonly used? I feel like most of the time when I read tutorials I only read about parent/child relationships, even if the parent is passing props down to the child (which would be an owner/ownee relationship). \n\nI'm happy to make whatever changes need to be made in the documentation.\n\nTagging @lacker and @gaearon \n",
