Here I'm only fixing the regression in React 16 that made this a problem even when `setState` calls are in different components.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we shouldn't be diffing host components that are outside of `setState` path.\r\n\r\nSome indentation changes are due to tests I tweaked but they're unrelated. The only change there is to consistently add and remove `container` from the document. The real changes are only in the newly added test at the bottom, and in `CompleteWork`.",
