  "body": "Hey,\r\n\r\nI have been using react for sometime now and I never really understood what is meant by 'React is declarative'. \r\nI found an article today by Tyler McGinnis explaining the difference between imperative and declarative programming, and I found it very useful. In the article he also gives an example using React to explain the different approaches.\r\n\r\nI thought this might be useful for others and therefore I created this pull request to add it to the README.md. However, I am not sure this is the right place to link to articles. An alternative place would be on the reactjs.org website.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you feel this is a good idea, and if it would add value for others.\r\n\r\n**Before submitting a pull request,** please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.\r\n2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n5. Run `yarn test-prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) typechecks (`yarn flow`).\r\n10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n**Learn more about contributing:** https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n",
