  "body": "We've found that there's a bunch of edge-cases that require propagation to be immediately stopped for `click`, `keyup` and `contextmenu`, so that events do not traverse to other event handlers. These cases are rare and should probably be addressed with a different product design, but in order to unblock product code, this functionality has been added.\r\n\r\nNote: we will likely remove this functionality at some point in the future.",
