  "body": "Component declaration should contain a whitelist of properties, e.g. it could require that you list the property name under `propTypes` even if it is assigned `null` (that could mean \"any type\", a broader version of `React.PropTypes.node`).\n\nIf a property that is not defined in `propTypes` is passed to a component declaration an error must be raised.\n\nThis would provide several benefits:\n- Would help to catch TYPOs\n- Would promote type declaration\n- Would prevent orphan properties\n## Catching Typos\n\nSuppose a component that generates a different type of input depending on a `type` value. This component has a default `type` value \"text\".\n\n``` js\nvar Input = React.createClass({\n    getDefaultProps: function () {\n        return {\n            type: 'text'\n        }\n    },\n    render: function () {\n        // Different logic defending on the type name.\n        // this.props.type === 'text'\n\n        return <div />;\n    }\n});\n```\n\nIf `Input` instance declaration is defined with a typo in the `type` property, it would not be an obvious error.\n\n``` jsx\n<Input tupe='password' />\n```\n\nRaising an error \"Unknown property 'tupe'.\" would help to catch the error.\n## Promoting Type Declaration\n\nIf property names are required to be listed under `propTypes`, it requires little extra effort to define their types.\n\n``` js\nvar Input = React.createClass({\n    propTypes: {\n        type: React.PropTypes.string,\n        // type: null\n    },\n    render: function () {\n        return <div />;\n    }\n});\n```\n\nFurthermore, we are used to think about _code-length_ in terms of the lines of code. The fact that type declaration at the moment adds extra lines might be discouraging some developers from doing it. This thought is only to boost the importance of the earlier argument.\n## Preventing Orphan Properties\n\nThis is especially relevant when using spread operator inheritance.\n\nSuppose an instance of a simple (`Input`) component is declared using a spread operator.\n\n``` jsx\n<Input {...generalFormProps} name='foo' />\n```\n\n, where `generalFormProps` is an object containing many properties of which just some apply to `Input` component. In this scenario, each `Input` instance would have a copy of those property values (dead weight).\n",
