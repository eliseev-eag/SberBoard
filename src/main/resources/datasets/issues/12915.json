  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nCode for reproducing is [here](https://github.com/alexeyraspopov/react-suspense-sandbox/tree/cb3b60be69523de8f720a474c965face2b521b9b). I've also deployed an example to Zeit Now: https://suspense-fpwoufdzfv.now.sh/.\r\n\r\nThis is a basic example of using React Suspense and Simple Cache Provider. Postponing text rendering and showing loading spinners when it's necessary.\r\n\r\nI can see my use of `<Timeout />` doesn't really care about `ms` I'm passing â€” it always become expired right after the render. You can open a page and the loading bar appears immediately despite `1000ms` delay that it has.\r\n\r\nThere is content that is placed next to an async component (the one that's going to be suspended).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/alexeyraspopov/react-suspense-sandbox/blob/cb3b60be69523de8f720a474c965face2b521b9b/src/index.js#L51-L56\r\n\r\nLooking at React Suspense tests, it is assumed that sibling elements can be rendered in any way.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n`<Timeout />` component only shows placehold when expired, sibling content is shown even if an async component was suspended.\r\n\r\nI built sources for `react`, `react-dom`, and `simple-cache-provider` from the current master, updating `enableSuspense` flag. I also used `<unstable_AsyncMode />` but it didn't seem to make any difference.\r\n\r\nI overall was really satisfied with this feature. I hope I did the code correctly so it shows the real bug. ",
