  "body": "This is a follow up to the handling of event `timeStamp` properties in the experimental event system. After discussion with @necolas, it felt a bit messy to be passing around `delay` values and calculating `timeStamp`s in the responder modules themselves. This PR moves that logic so it can easily be handled by using `context.getTimeStamp()` â€“ the event responder system deals with time stamps instead. For now it works like it did before, using the `nativeEvent`'s `timeStamp` value, but we can easily change this heuristic as it's now an implementation detail in `context`.\r\n\r\nI also took the opportunity to add `timeStamp` to the other event responders and made it a mandatory field (as it should be).",
