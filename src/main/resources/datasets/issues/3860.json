  "body": "In the documentation for [controlled components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html#controlled-components), it says:\n\n```\nForm components allow listening for changes by setting a callback to the onChange prop. The onChange prop works across browsers to fire in response to user interactions when:\n\nThe value of <input> or <textarea> changes.\nThe checked state of <input> changes.\n```\n\nHowever my checkbox's onChange handler is getting called even though its checked state dosen't actually change, because it's controlled.  I think the documentation should be changed to state that onChange is fired in response to user input on the component, even if React leaves the component state as it is.\n",
