  "body": "After staring at the confusing mess that is the synthetic event system today and talking with @sebmarkbage, we're no longer confident that we need the pooling that the system currently uses. GCs have gotten pretty good so we may be experiencing diminishing returns at this point, or maybe losing out on some benefits. We do have to consider that we still support some older browsers who's GCs don't have the benefit of the last several years worth of innovations so it might be premature, but it's probably worth investigating.\n",
