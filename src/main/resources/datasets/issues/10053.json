  "body": "I noticed while working on #10024 that the new server renderer still adds a markup checksum to the root HTML element. However, I'm fairly certain that, given the new DOM walking rehydration strategy, the checksum isn't used on the client side at all.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the markup checksum in `renderToString` and adjusts a few tests that explicitly looked for it to be there. All the other tests of client rendering on top of server markup work untouched.",
