  "body": "In the new Reactjs.org docs, the nav only has different pages. This makes it very difficult to quickly find / jump to a part of the docs you care about.\r\n\r\nIf this change would be accepted, I'll create the PR for it. \r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-09-29 at 3 53 48 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/987092/31038967-aae43ed4-a52e-11e7-89ab-fd6bf561adcd.png)\r\n\r\nFor example - what are the life cycle events in React?\r\nThe closest thing in the nav is \"Quick Start > State and Lifecycle\". After navigating to this page, and reading for a few seconds - it becomes clear this is a tutorial. Is there a list of the lifecycle events? I'm not sure. I scan through the whole page. Doesn't look like it, but maybe I just missed it.\r\n\r\nRepeating this process of scrolling through entire pages is time consuming, so instead I just google \"react 16 lifecycle events\" and end up finding it on someone's independent blog post.\r\n",
