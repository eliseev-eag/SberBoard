I am having an issue to add custom attribute to built-in AMP element. In order to be able to use [amp-bind](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-bind#bindings) we need to be able to output “bindings”, which are special attributes of the form `[attribute]`, eg. `[slide]=\"selectedSlide\"`. \r\n\r\n```\r\n<amp-carousel \r\n    layout={layout}\r\n    height={height}\r\n    width={width}\r\n    [slide]={slide}\r\n>\r\n        ...\r\n</amp-carousel>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is AMP carousel example that work with [amp-bind](https://ampbyexample.com/advanced/image_galleries_with_amp-carousel/#linking-carousels-with-amp-bind).\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n- Parsing error: Unexpected token [ (Fatal) \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n- All\r\n\r\nFor more information, you can read all the discussion in this [PR](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7311#issuecomment-311516763).",
