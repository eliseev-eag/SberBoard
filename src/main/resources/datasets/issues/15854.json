  "body": "This PR does two things:\r\n\r\n- The `removeRootEventTypes` calls in `Press` have been moved around. Previously they always occurred after dispatching an event during `pointerup` (among other events). Instead we now do this during the `click` event. This allows us to use the `stopPropagation` feature to apply to other root events; otherwise we stop short of handling them.\r\n\r\n- `click` has also been made a root event. Given we add root events and remove them conditionally, this should slightly improve runtime performance.",
