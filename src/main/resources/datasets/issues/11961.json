Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n```\r\nsetState(() => null, () => console.log('why did I was called?');\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe setState callback won't be called.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16.0\r\nDidn't try on previous versions",
