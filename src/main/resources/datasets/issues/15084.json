We catch that in the lint rule now when possible (in the same component) and suggest a fix. But it's tricky if you pass something several levels down.\r\n\r\nIf you autofix the `useEffect`, would it also be possible to autofix any functions added by wrapping them in a `useCallback` at the same time?\r\n\r\nThis would greatly improve the user experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
