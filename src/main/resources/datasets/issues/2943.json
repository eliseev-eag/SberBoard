  "body": "I ran into an issue where the `jsx` command-line build tool wouldn't build a folder full of `.jsx` files.\n\n```\n$ jsx --help\n    Usage: jsx [options] <source directory> <output directory> [<module ID> [<module ID> ...]]\n    [...]\n$ ls src\nApp.jsx  Inbox.jsx  Login.jsx\n$ jsx src/ build/js/\n[]\n```\n\nYou get cryptic output (empty array) and nothing happens. This caused me an hour or two of confusion, and I tried checking the docs and eventually just read the source for `jsx`, saw it uses `commoner`, and found out from further digging:\n\nTurns out `jsx` requires the input files to have a `.js` extension (rather than `.jsx`).\n\n**I think it might help people to put a short section in the docs on how to integrate `jsx` into your build.**\n\nIn short, and correct me if I'm wrong:\n- JSX files should be end in .js, not in .jsx\n- Use `jsx src/ dst/` to compile a folder full of JSX files to plain JS\n- The `/** @jsx React.DOM */` comment is no longer required and has no effect\n- If you're using Browserify, you don't have to use `jsx` at all, just use `--reactify`\n\nThoughts?\n",
