  "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes most test failures reported by Jest's new --detectLeaks feature\r\n\r\nNote: I wasn't able to see [any measurable difference](http://dp.hanlon.io/350E3H0z2Z3d) in heap usage using --logHeapUsage so this probably isn't as big of a deal as it would seem, just good to fix if we can\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nNow that detectLeaks works in Jest 22, I ran it on the React repo and found that ~110/130 tests report leaks. That number is approximate because some tests **leak intermittently**\r\n\r\nAfter investigating the leaks, I found that 1 line accounted for ~100 of the leaks. Removing this line reduces the failures from ~110 to ~10. \r\n\r\nIt looks like assigning a function to any window attribute inside setupEnvironment will leak the Window after the test due to the setupEnvironment closure. **I've filed a bug in Jest [here](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/5309)**\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nRunning this command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nyarn test --detectLeaks\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n![](http://dp.hanlon.io/3o163d0P0n2C/Image%202018-01-14%20at%203.56.25%20PM.png)\r\n\r\n### After\r\n![](http://dp.hanlon.io/3g2v1O3r263D/Image%202018-01-14%20at%203.41.38%20PM.png)\r\n\r\nNote: a good file to test this with which will reliably fail on master and work on this branch is `invertObject-test.js`. These test could be in `env=node` yet this like still leaks Window object:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nyarn test --detectLeaks invertObject-test.js\r\n```",
