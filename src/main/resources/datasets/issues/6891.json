  "body": "I thought it might be useful to be able to jump to the source code right from the documentation.\n\nE.g. If [`ReactDOM.render`](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#reactdom.render) section in docs included a link to the [source](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/client/ReactMount.js#L530) in Github.\n\nI believe easier access to the source code will increase familiarity with how things work in the background and perhaps induce community involvement. \n\nI also understand this might add complexity to docs management and it could also be difficult to point to the right source file when e.g. depends on the platform server/client). \n\nMaybe I'm spoiled with how [JSDuck handles it](http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.0/6.0.2-classic/#!/api/Ext.container.Container).\n\nAny ideas are welcome here. \n",
