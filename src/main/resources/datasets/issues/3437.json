  "body": "I'm currently trying to use React's JSX transformer before a Google Closure run, under Advanced optimisations. The problem is, attributes are being renamed by the closure compiler, and are failing at run time.\n\nFor example; `<Route handler={app} path=\"/\" >`\nis being transformed into; `React.createElement(ReactRouter.Route, {handler:app, path:\"/\"})`\nwhich is being compiled into; `React.createElement(ReactRouter.Route, {e:b, path:\"/\"})`\n\nThe preposed solution is to allow the [quoteAttrName](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/0.13-stable/vendor/fbtransform/transforms/jsx.js#L96) to always quote all names in the config param of `createElement`. This would mean the Closure compiler would leave the config object alone.\n\nDoes anybody have thoughts on this?\n\n_Note: in the compiled option, `b` is correct as the compiler renamed the react component._\n",
