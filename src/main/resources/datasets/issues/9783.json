Moreover, `event.nativeEvent` also shows bubbling phase, so probably the reason is not in syntethic event.\r\n\r\nhttps://jsbin.com/xebarapije/2/edit?js,console,output\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n`onClickCapture` calls during capturing phase\r\n`onClick` calls during bubbling phase\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
