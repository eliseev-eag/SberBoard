  "body": "#### Issue\n\nWe run into an animation issue where the _active_ class is added to fast after the child has been added to the ReactCSSTransitionGroup. This happens if the framerate drops below 60 FPS on Chrome Version 49.0.2623.112 (64-bit). \n#### Reason\n\nThe reason is the following timeout in ReactCSSTransitionGroupChild.js (line 110):\n\n```\nthis.timeout = setTimeout(this.flushClassNameQueue, TICK);  // TICK === 17 milliseconds\n```\n\nIf the framerate is low the animated object appears directly in the animation _active_ state because the browser did not have enough time to process the previously added _enter_ class.\n#### Fix\n\nWe fixed this internally by queing the function above with two chained `requestAnimationFrame()` calls instead of the `timeout()`.\n\nHas anybody else encountered this issue? Anybody interested in a pull request?\n\nRegards,\nMirko\n",
