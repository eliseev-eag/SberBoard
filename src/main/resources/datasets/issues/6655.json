  "body": "It's way too much work to do a React release right now. It's mostly muscle memory for me at this point but it should be easy for anybody to do it. Historically I kept certain steps manual because I screwed things up and wanted to be able to pause and double check.\n\nThere are a few things contributing to the difficulty:\n- use of react-bower repo as the first push target\n  - which is a result of fb.me link generation / CDNization needing to happen on internal FB infra\n- manual steps across multiple repos\n- manual version modification\n- assets needing to be in multiple places, copied across branches\n\nA few ideas:\n- we should be able to differentiate between pre- and final releases. It should be a single command to ship a new alpha at any point and they should be lightweight.\n- final releases need a little more since they will get installed by default by people and have additional requirements (eg changelogs, assets in multiple places)\n- `npm run release` which then does all the things. It could be an interactive process\n- start using the GitHub releases APIs to store build assets, cutting out steps\n- set up cdn.reactjs.org and just host our builds there, dropping fb.me entirely (risk, we have to run this foreverâ€¦)\n  - alternatives: work with existing CDNs and make sure we can have versions deployed on command (pull based autoupdating can result in delays, things like jsfiddle, our tutorial need assets available immediately)\n- investigate lerna, could be helpful with the multiple packages we have, though we ideally want to disentangle the releases\n",
