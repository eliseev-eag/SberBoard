I just want to make sure that I'm headed in the right direction for solving https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5939\n\nI'm not certain where the logic for deconstructing SyntheticEvents occurs. My guess is it's an abstraction that utilizes the `EventInterface`.\n\nAlso, what's the proper way to reference `NODE_ENV` for doing this only in development mode.\n\nThank you for helping a newbie to the codebase :-)\n",
