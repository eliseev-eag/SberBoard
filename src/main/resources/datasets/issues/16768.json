  "body": "After speaking to @gaearon today, he mentioned that we can extract the internal interface of `TabFocusController` so that it's exposed as an import rather than as an internal interface on the functional component (thus removing the need to use `useImperativeMethods` hook). This should improve the performance, memory and overall explicitness quite a bit â€“ plus making more sense as a general way of handling tab focus across other scopes.\r\n\r\nI made the module `ReactTabFocus` as this is more like a bucket of methods + component needed for handling browser tab focus.",
