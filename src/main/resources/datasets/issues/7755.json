  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nFeature\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\n`event.type` returns the original all lowercase event type name\n\n**Description**\nAs a library or component author it would be nice to receive the event type as camelCase in the same way React requires the name to be camelCase when passing it through as a prop. This would allow authors to pass through props easier and allow people to still hook into these events.\n\n**Example Usage**\n\n```\n_handleEvent = (e) => {\n    const propEvent = this.props[`on${e.type}`]\n\n    // library/component specific code\n\n    if (typeof propEvent === 'function') {\n      propEvent(e)\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nThis is totally doable right now, but would require a third party add-on or function to keep track of new events added to React. It would be nice if React just provided the camelCase name for us :)\n",
