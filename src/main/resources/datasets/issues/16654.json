  "body": "This PR introduces a few fixes and core changes that are required for having event listeners/responders on scope components:\r\n\r\n- Removes `responderTarget` from the responder event object. Instead `context.getCurrentTarget()` has been introduced that achieves the same purpose, without needing to mutate the event object. Furthermore, this works with scopes, which do not have a direct DOM node (instead the nearest current DOM from the target is picked up).\r\n\r\n- Fixes a bug @necolas found and fixed in another PR, which also came up in this with the responder target changes above, so they were needed here too.\r\n\r\n- Scope components via `React.unstable_createScope` now accept event responders via the `listeners` prop, like host components can. This makes it easier to compose scopes that need to tight control over handling things like keyboard/focus interactions.",
