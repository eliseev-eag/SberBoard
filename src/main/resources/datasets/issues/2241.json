  "body": "Broken behavior discovered/encountered by #1510\n\n**EDIT:** I found a handful more broken edge-cases so I decided to do a large makeover instead, simplifying the logic and removing state entirely.\n\nI've intentionally made it \"reset to default\" if you toggle `multiple` because it simplified the code and I don't think it's a sane transition (browsers don't agree on what should happen either). But I could easily add it back if you disagree, but I figured it wasn't worth the size and complexity cost.\n\nAs far as I'm aware, all edge-cases should be fixed now.\n\n~~Previously, state would only be updated on user interaction or when toggling `multiple`. This meant that any forced `value` update was not remembered when toggling `multiple` or becoming uncontrolled.~~\n\n~~To solve this it has to read value during `componentWillReceiveProps`, which `LinkedValueUtils` couldn't do. So I updated `LinkedValueUtils` to take a `props`-object instead, which seems consistent with the direction of a reactjs-future proposal as well.~~\n- [x] **Test plan:** `grunt test` and cursory manual testing\n- [x] Poach test-case from #2289\n\n```\n   raw     gz Compared to master @ 4f27dc30ad065856c9ed7de9c4dd8366801b9486\n  -215    -85 build/react-with-addons.js\n  -166    -92 build/react-with-addons.min.js\n  -215    -83 build/react.js\n  -166    -97 build/react.min.js\n```\n",
