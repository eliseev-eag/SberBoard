  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nboth?\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen developing a react component as a package, it is common practice to `npm link` your local copy into a project.  For this to work you need a copy of react installed in both directores, otherwise node and browserify (haven't tested with webkit) are not able to find it.  This results in a ton of warnings for \"manually calling a React.PropTypes validation function\".\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI am assuming it means \"you have two copies of react on the page\".  But preferably there should be first class support for developers working in the methodology.  Barring the ability to test for this condition directly, it would be nice to disable warnings in some fashion.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nCurrently testing with react 15.3.2",
