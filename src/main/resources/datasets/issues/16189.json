An exception are all attributes starting with `on` - for obvious security reasons. [(Source)](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/08/dom-attributes-in-react-16.html#changes-in-detail)\r\nHowever, this restriction makes it impossible to write interactive AMP pages in React, since all actions are defined using the `on` attribute. [(Example)](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/examples/standard-actions.amp.html)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt should be possible to use the `on` attribute, so that it is also passed to the DOM.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nAll React Versions",
