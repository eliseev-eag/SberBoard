  "body": "- [x] Support hyphenated DOM components in JSX transform\n- [ ] Usage from within an html import\n- [x] Inserting components into a shadow DOM fragment (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/840)\n- [x] Arbitrary properties on DOM components\n- [ ] Proper event handling\n  - [ ] Events fired inside shadow DOM (https://discuss.atom.io/t/event-handling-with-the-shadow-dom-and-react/14580)\n  - [ ] Custom events (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events)\n- [ ] Component prototype to provide change detection and execute a rerender.  We will want a component to be able to rerender, for instance, when the component's children (effectively treated as a prop in react) changes.  Detecting such changes will require a a default component implementation that does things like initialize a MutationObserver (https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#mutationobserver).\n- [ ] Potentially defer rendering until we're in the dom (as per https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/2398)\n- [x] Remove tagName property (as per https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/2288)\n- [ ] Support complex types as parameters to web components.  React components can take complex types, whereas dom nodes can only take in strings.  To pass a complex type to a web component, we'll need to run code at mount time that passes the additional parameters to the instantiated web component.\n-  [ ] Stateful Imperative Bridge (as per https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1711)\n",
