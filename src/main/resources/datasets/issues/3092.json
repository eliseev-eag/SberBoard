  "body": "There has been discussion about webworkers before, @petehunt made already an implementation and @sebmarkbage has some ideas on how he wants to accomplish it within the current code base. If I remember correctly, React should not just run in a webworker but both in the \"main thread\" and a webworker. \n\nSo, what are we waiting for? @sebmarkbage would be great if you could give a more detailed outline of your ideas so we can get this moving :-).\n",
