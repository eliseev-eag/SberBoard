Instead, it should behave identically to the app mounted with `ReactDOM.render()`.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI'm using Chrome 75.0.3770.142, macOS 10.14.3, and react 16.9.0-alpha-0\r\n\r\nN.B. This issue is pretty much the same as #15900, though that one seemed to have more moving parts. Please merge these if appropriate.",
