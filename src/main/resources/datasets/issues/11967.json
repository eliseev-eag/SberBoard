  "body": "As described in #11092, this PR adds support for passing in externs to GCC to allow it to compile bundles in advanced mode without renaming properties that are part of the public API. Most of the externs were taken from https://github.com/cljsjs/packages/tree/master/react/resources/cljsjs/, although some more needed to be added. I've split them into various files with necessary comments so they should be reasonably easy to follow.\r\n\r\nAt this point, the node bundles do not build correctly (the module.exports part is stripped out), so we can't run tests just yet. So I just tested by pointing the babel-standalone fixture to the built prod files and loading it. The current fixture works successfully, and I was able to create a functional component as well. But when I tried creating a component by extending `React.Component`, I saw `class constructor cannot be invoked without 'new'`, indicating that another property is getting renamed and causing the functional component codepath to execute for non-functional components.\r\n\r\n(This is my first PR to an FB project, so I just submitted the CLA.)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Get all `test-build-prod` tests to pass\r\n- [ ] Don't use fbjs externs for UMD bundles for better minification\r\n- [ ] Clean up externs files to remove old methods that no longer exist\r\n- [ ] Try [Splitting JS into modules](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10395810/how-do-i-split-my-javascript-into-modules-using-googles-closure-compiler/10401030#10401030) to allow minifying react internal properties accessed across bundle boundaries\r\n  ",
