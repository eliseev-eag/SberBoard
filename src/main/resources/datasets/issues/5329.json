  "body": "This is a fix for #5295.\n\n`<input>` and `<textarea>` elements are being updated in the DOM every time that `ReactDOMComponent.updateComponent` is called. This PR makes it so that the elements are only updated in the DOM when their values change. I also added tests to make sure that this is the case.\n\nI am not sure about the `<textarea>` fix - it doesn't seem like the right place to be checking if the value has been updated. However, `ReactDOMTextarea.getNativeProps` sets `props.value` to `undefined`, so it isn't possible to compare the previous and next props after that.\n",
