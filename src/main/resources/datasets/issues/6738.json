  "body": "React Native requires 15.0.3 which is currently published as 15.0.3-alpha.2. Installing this module leads to peerDependency warnings and errors (ex: `npm shrinkwrap` actually fails) because several packages have peerDeps on react@^15.0.0 and 15.0.3-alpha.2 doesn't match.\n\nSeveral people including myself have raised the issue with npm but for the time being could FB publish master as 15.0.3 and use npm's dist-tag feature to tag 15.0.2 as \"latest\" and 15.0.3 as \"next\" or \"at-your-own-risk\"?\n",
