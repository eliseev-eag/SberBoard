  "body": "I know its bikeshedding but the name of this function triggered my OCD a little bit because it sounds (to me) like a name for a boolean variable. Most commonly other functions with similar purpose are named in the codebase with verb as first work, i.e. `isValidElementType`.\r\n\r\nWhile renaming it I've also noticed that this code was duplicated and already out of sync (one having a dev warning, one not having it) so I thought it would be also a good thing to move it to shared directory to keep a single source of truth.\r\n",
