  "body": "As stated in the docs and shown in #4410, the return value of `React.Children.map` is incompatible with the `React.Children.only` function, and will return with the error message:\r\n> Invariant Violation: Invariant Violation: React.Children.only expected to receive a single React element child.\r\n\r\nif used. \r\n\r\nThis incompatibility causes some fairly annoying restrictions, however. From what I understand, this means that you can't edit the properties of a component's children at runtime if they contain any component that requires a single child. (eg. you can't dynamically set the disabled prop of a child `TouchableNativeFeedback` component in the parent).\r\n\r\nI believe this is due to the type differences between the `this.props.children` parameter and the `React.Children.map` return value, the former being a valid element and the latter not (see #4424 and https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/87). \r\n\r\nI'd like to make a request to have the return type of `React.Children.map` be the same as the type of `this.props.children`, which will fix these quirks and be much more intuitive. A separate static function that converts the return type of `React.Children.map` to the same type as `this.props.children` would also solve the issue. It feels like some sort of fix is in order, since it's a broad and strange restriction on the components you can use.",
