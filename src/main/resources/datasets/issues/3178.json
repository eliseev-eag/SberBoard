  "body": "Hey all! So i'm currently looking into different solutions for testing React and exploring `jsdom` with `mocha` does anyone have any good suggestions or repos? I've read quite a few articles and everyone seems to have a different way of doing it. I'm wondering if there is a good solid way that will be compatible with newer releases of React. \n\nThanks!\n",
