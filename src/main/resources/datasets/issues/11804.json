  "body": "The main goal here is to factor the DOM attribute code in the light of how it currently works, instead of how it was conceived five years ago.\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few things in the current code that don't make sense anymore. For example, the \"property\" vs \"attribute\" distinction in method naming doesn't actually correspond to properties vs attributes. Another example: `shouldSetAttribute` doesn't actually determine whether to set an attribute. These were all results of incremental changes where we tried to tweak the behavior with the least amount of code. But they ended up making the overall flow confusing and adding a lot of special cases.\r\n\r\nThis is an attempt to simplify the code without changing what it does. Individual commits tell how I arrived at that. This mostly changes the logic around *setting* attributes/properties and doesn't touch the other parts that are still structured the old way (such as `get*Attribute|Property` pairs used for validating SSR). I think we can get to those a bit later.",
