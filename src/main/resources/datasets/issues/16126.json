  "body": "Sebastian and I have just discussed [my concerns around `React.warn` and `React.error`](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/16017). The quick takeaway is this: I am going to remove `React.warn` and `React.error` for now. We can revisit these methods later as part of a larger discussion around the console logging experience with React (see #15726) but we should not block 16.9 for this.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, I will be adding functionality to React DevTools to intercept calls to `console.error`, `console.warn`, and `console.trace` and auto-append component stacks (in DEV mode). This seems like a nice 80/20 solution that doesn't limit our options for a future API.",
