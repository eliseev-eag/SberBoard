  "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nThis PR is my attempt at updating the tests for `getEventKey.js` to use the public API. I browsed other test examples that were provided in #11299. After reading those and `getEventKey.js` I came up with an approach that uses `Simulate` and `SimulateNative` on the ref node and captures the synthetic event in the `onKeyPressCapture` and `onKeyPressCapture` handlers. It then tests properties on the event that was passed in.\r\n\r\nI had some questions along the way:\r\n- Is this the right approach?\r\n- Am I using `Simulate`/`SimulateNative` correctly?\r\n- Am I generating the component/ref node generated correctly?\r\n\r\nThank you for the contribution opportunity!\r\n\r\nCheers",
