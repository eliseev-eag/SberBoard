  "body": "This PR cleans up the Flow type annotations by leveraging generics instead of importing from the host config, which led to bad Flow types in some places and also breakage of the RN sync (it required a temporary hack to make RN sync work again).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, given that `unstable_createEvent` is now back on the `React` object, rather than the renderer, we can enforce a consistent `EventResponder` structure that all renders use, which makes more sense going forward â€“ as we initially thought that different renderers would use different event responder structures. This also sets us up nicely for using Flare in RN without too many changes.\r\n\r\nThis PR also ensures that `useEvent` defines an empty object props if not passed an object and makes event responder state always an object (if none is defined). This helps reduce the complexity of the responder API contract.",
