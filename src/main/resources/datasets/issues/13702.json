While navigating between the routes, I noticed that the component from the previous route is still present in the memory e.g. If I navigate from route1 to route2, I can see that component corresponding to route1 is still in the memory. Moreover, if I change my route from route1 to route2 then route2 to route3, the component from route1 is cleared out and route2 component is still in the memory while I am at route3. \r\n\r\nAdding heap snapshot for this unexpected behaviour :\r\n![react1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7602070/45832299-28be5c00-bd1f-11e8-937a-37d6c9da4270.JPG)\r\n\r\nCodeSandbox demo for reproducing the same: [Demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/9z7qylm4mo)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIdeally, component corresponding to the previous route must be completely removed from the memory when we navigate to the new route. Or there must be some rule if we are keeping it for some optimizations.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nreact 16.4.2\r\nreact 16.4.2\r\nreact-router-dom 4.3.1\r\n",
