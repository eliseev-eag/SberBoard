  "body": "The next release of React will be v15.2.0. We shipped an RC to npm last week. React Native v0.29 went to RC this week using our RC, but we should ship final before they do so RN is only using final versions. I think we have another week+ before their branch cut but ideally we get out sooner. We haven't heard of any issues so we're going to assume that this is in good shape. I'm planning to ship React 15.2.0 on Monday (June 27).\n\ncc @ide (not sure who is running RN release this time around, but feel free to cc them)\n\nTodo:\n- [x] Pull in other PRs\n  - [ ] #7098\n  - [ ] #7153\n- [x] write changelog (@zpao)\n- [x] actually ship (@zpao/@keyanzhang)\n- [ ] blog post about error codes (@keyanzhang)\n",
