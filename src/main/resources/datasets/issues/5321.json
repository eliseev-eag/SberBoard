  "body": "I'm removing some old and deprecated APIs from jest that should have never made it into any of our open source libraries because these APIs were deprecated from the start and only persisted because we didn't have tools like jscodeshift when jest was originally created.\n\nIn a future version (likely 0.7.0) jest will not support the `mocks` or `mock-modules` modules. This pull request:\n- Updates jest to 0.6.1\n- Updates deprecated API usage through a codemod, see http://astexplorer.net/#/zrybZ6UvRA and https://github.com/cpojer/js-codemod/blob/master/transforms/jest-update.js\n- Created two mock modules because `getMetadata` and `generateFromMetadata` will be fully removed from jest's \"public\" API. They are implicit APIs that only work through the module boundary. The replacement is `genMockFromModule`.\n\nThe last of these changes is probably slightly controversial because it creates two mock files. Across all internal tests at FB `getMetadata` and `generateFromMetadata` is used less than 10 times but those use cases may be valid. I'm considering to add an API like `jest.mockClass(MyClass)`, however currently I'm focused on reducing the surface area of jest to be able to rewrite the module loader and resolver. I'd prefer to move forward with this PR and then move the test components back into the tests when a new API in jest is available iff it proves necessary.\n",
