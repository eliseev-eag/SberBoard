The prior discussion concluded that, because the development and production builds are very different and it's not clear whether the unpkg default should be dev or production, React doesn't include a field at all and leaves it up to the consumers.\r\n\r\nMy bias is: I'm working on [observable](https://beta.observablehq.com/), which uses [d3-require](https://github.com/d3/d3-require) to include modules from `unpkg`. People type `require('d3')` and it resolves to `https://unpkg.com/d3` which then redirects to the d3 web-compatible distribution.\r\n\r\nPeople _can_ type `require('react/umd/react.development.js')`, but it's hard to figure that one out - they have to look at unpkg itself and hunt around for those UMDs. So we're considering:\r\n\r\n- Hardcoding workarounds for react & react-dom, because they're very popular modules and few people are figuring out how to require them.\r\n- Creating a react wrapper that sets an `unpkg` field and re-points to react\r\n- Submitting another PR to react re-proposing a default export\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nReact and ReactDOM would provide - if not a default - some indication of where their `dist` files and what their meanings are.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nAll?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThanks for all y'all's work on React, it's excellent!",
