  "body": "The `ContextTypes`, and `PropTypes` that have to set for validation are a fine concept. But when already using a language like typescript which takes care of the typing, it is extremely redundant and painful to have to keep updating the `ContextTypes` in particular. \n\n`PropTypes`, however are alteast optional, but `ContextTypes` aren't. Please provide an option to make them optional so that when using languages that provide static typing on top js, the pointless redundancy can be eliminated.\n",
