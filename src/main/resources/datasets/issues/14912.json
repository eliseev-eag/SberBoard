  "body": "Related to: react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals#72\r\n\r\nWe want people to call the new top level API for setNativeProps that was added in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/14907. This PR adds deprecation warnings for the current methods. \r\n\r\nI need to think about how I want to handle the migration of core and internal and could use some insight. I could:\r\n\r\n- hold off on landing this and instead update core to the new API before any warnings land\r\n- land this and add a yellow box ignore internally as we are converting core. If this change goes out with 0.60 then we have time. We might want to land this in 0.59 to have the warnings out as soon as possible although that would also mean we'd need to cherry pick the fixes for these warnings in core into 0.59",
