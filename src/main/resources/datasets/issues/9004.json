  "body": "Allows users to check arbitrary objects against React prop types without relying on the implementation details of the prop validators themselves. An example of why this is important: some prop validators may throw, while others return an error object. Calling a prop validator manually requires handling both cases. `checkPropTypes` does this for you.\r\n\r\nThe default behavior is to skip repeated warnings, like normal prop type checking already does. I added an optional parameter to override that and always warn; not sure if we really need that though.",
