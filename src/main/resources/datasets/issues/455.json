  "body": "I was looking for some pointers on how to test applications that are built with React and I couldn't find anything. I think it would really be helpful to have a page in the docs explaining how to test apps built with React (documenting some best practices).\n\nI found some tests in this repository, but to me it looks like they are unit tests for the core library, and not applicable to testing custom components, etc.\n\nSome questions I had:\n- Am I supposed to just test the model and not React components?\n- Am I supposed to use acceptance tests automated by something like Selenium?\n- Is there a nice way to unit test my React components?\n\nAny pointers would be greatly appreciated!\n",
