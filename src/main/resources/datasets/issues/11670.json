  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nfeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nreact-dom SSR performance could be improved using server-side cache, but currently the\r\nReactPartialRenderer is currently not accessible from the `react-dom` package.\r\n\r\n**Desired behavior**\r\nOn the **server** only, it would be nice if _plugins_ could be used to improve render performance. Currently the only way to do this would be to externally maintain a renderer implementation. However, the `ReactPartialRenderer` already contains all the behavior required to support plugins - with a little refactoring. \r\n\r\nI've refactored the `ReactPartialRenderer` and created a **proof of concept** for supporting _plugins_ for react server side rendering. You can see the [ReactPartialPluginRenderer](https://github.com/adam-26/react/commits/pluginRenderer) in this fork, its comprised of 3 different commits:\r\n* [#1](https://github.com/adam-26/react/commit/0b2f7852a19ffabac6b83581f6821f0346434ef0): Strict refactoring of `ReactPartialRenderer`, the only addition is exporting the `ReactPartialRenderer` from the react-dom server package\r\n* [#2](https://github.com/adam-26/react/commit/d30792a8ba42d50188c0dd1fddbc73275b8ff91f): Create the `ReactPartialPluginRenderer` by extending the refactored `ReactPluginRenderer`, and introduce a plugin interface\r\n* [#3](https://github.com/adam-26/react/commit/d4f01973d535c9eb34ba450190b7c8205fe593df): Proof of concept plugin implementations and application example.\r\n\r\nYou can [view instructions for running the example in the repo](https://github.com/adam-26/react/tree/pluginRenderer/fixtures/ssrPlugins).\r\n\r\nI understand that exporting `ReactPartialRenderer` exposes the internal API, which is far from ideal. Is there any scenario in which `ReactPartialRenderer` would be made to be accessible from the `react-dom` package? Or would a plugin implementation similar to above be required to maintain its own forked `ReactPartialRenderer`? Maintaining the plugin renderer in its own repo isn't a problem, but It would be great if plugins could be used without needing to maintain the core server renderer.\r\n\r\nThanks, Adam.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
