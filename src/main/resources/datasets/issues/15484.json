  "body": "From the React.org docs:\r\n> Error boundaries preserve the declarative nature of React, [...] somewhere deep in the tree, **it will still correctly propagate to the closest error boundary.**\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nI am not sure if this is a bug or intended behavior, because it only happens with `ReactDOM.hydrate` when an error is thrown only within `render`.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIf an error is thrown in the `render()` method of any component, the error boundary at any given top-level renders its fallback exactly where that component is, instead of where the error boundary is defined.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/74kmwk3o1j\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nJust like it `ReactDOM.hydrate` behaves if the error happens in `componentDidMount`, the error boundary's fallback should be rendered where the error boundary element is actually declared.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nv16.8.6 on Chrome, haven't tested previous versions, but I think to remember this working correctly when we upgraded to v16 and added our top-level, page boundary.\r\n",
