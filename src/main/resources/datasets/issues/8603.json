We are rendering the feed through our React setup but we are unable to provide the needed attributes on the root `<rss>` tag.\r\n```Unknown prop `xmlns:content` on <rss> tag. Remove this prop from the element. For details, see https://fb.me/react-unknown-prop```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nAttribute `xmlnsContent` (and probably some other rss-familiar attributes) transpiles to `xmlns:content`\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact v. 15.3.2\r\n",
