  "body": "Attempts to fix https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14792. I don't really know this code but this is my guess.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this code doesn't always end up being called from a root work cycle. It can run from the scheduler (indeed, that's the normal case). In that case `isRendering` is true *inside* (so `ReactDOM.render` doesn't do anything) but we don't flush anything before the exit. Now we do.\r\n\r\nThis delays the actual render until the end of calling effects. I think it makes sense as it's consistent with what we do for commit phase effects.",
