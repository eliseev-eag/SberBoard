  "body": "ES6 style of creating components in React is clearly violating the [Uniform access principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_access_principle). It's a general source of confusion (and bugs) to be able to set state in two different ways:\n- You MUST do `this.state = {}` if you're in the constructor\n- You MUST do `this.setState()` everywhere else.\n\nI believe it'd be much better to have just 1 way to set state in general, and it should be universal. If we're already accessing state through `this.state`, and setting state in the constructor with `this.state`, why not do it everywhere else? The behavior of `this.setState` could be easily replicated with [ES6 Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy/handler/set).\n",
