  "body": "We don't really support duplicate keys, but the fact that we don't means you can get totally inconsistent output -- where your component thinks it is rendering one thing but is actually rendering another. The simplest manifestation of this is:\n\n```js\nfunction Foo(props) {\n  if (props.step === 1) {\n    return <>\n      <div key=\"bar\" />\n      <div key=\"bar\" />\n    </>;\n  } else {\n    return <>\n      <div key=\"baz\" />\n    </>;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you render step=1 then step=2, you'll end up with a DOM containing `bar` then `baz` even though that's \"logically impossible\".\n\nPeople who see a dupe key warning in DEV should heed it, but this is still pretty odd behavior (that can be caused by fluke unreliable server data), so maybe we can do better?",
