  "body": "I have two nested elements that can be scrolled but I only want to listen to the parent scroll event.\n\n```\n<div onScroll={handleScroll}>\n\n    <textarea>...</textarea>\n\n</div>\n```\n\nWhen the textarea is scrolled, the event bubbles to the parent onScroll event. Here is a working  example:\n\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/pv0vp44q/\n\nBug, feature? It appears like it ought not bubble [according to the spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-type-scroll). My workaround is to verify the target element when handling the scroll event or maybe preventing the textarea from sending it's scroll events.\n\nTested with React 0.14.3 Chrome/IE11\n",
