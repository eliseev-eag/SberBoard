  "body": "It’s Saturday and I’m supposed to do fun things. But the weather in London is gloomy, I just got a flu jab and feel sleepy, and I’ve already watched more TV than I’d like to admit. So, here goes another fun PR where we reduce the bundle size.\r\n\r\n|bundle |non-gzipped (before) | non-gzipped (after)|non-gzipped (diff)|gzipped (before)|gzipped (after)|gzipped (diff)|\r\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n| react-dom.production.min.js (UMD_PROD)                               | 97.88 KB  | 94.28 KB     | -4 %  | 31.1 KB   | 30.46 KB     | -3 %  |\r\n| react-dom.production.min.js (NODE_PROD)                              | 96.28 KB  | 92.51 KB     | -4 %  | 30.25 KB  | 29.63 KB     | -3 %  |\r\n\r\nPlease review as individual commits, and add `?w=1` to review pages to omit whitespace. The strategy is the same for each commit:\r\n\r\n* Convert file to named exports\r\n* Find all usages of the file\r\n* When convenient, use named imports\r\n* When inconvenient or necessary to keep the whole object, use namespace (star) imports\r\n\r\nOmitting whitespace with `?w=1` during review is important so that you don’t see giant diffs. Most of the changes is just indentation.\r\n\r\nThe size benefit comes from reducing junk at module boundaries, and being able to minify function names.\r\n\r\nEach individual commit is atomic and passes CI.\r\n\r\nThis uncovered one small Flow violation which for now I suppressed (https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/f2750171d9da370f7abc078aeac39423dd7a811c). It already exists in master but Flow didn’t catch it before.\r\n\r\nI verified the packaging fixtures still work.",
