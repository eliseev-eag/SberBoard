  "body": "This adds owner to invalid type invariant for Fiber. It's already there in Stack.\r\nIdeally we'd add component stack later here too, but I want parity for now.\r\n\r\nI changed `ReactDebugCurrentFiber.getCurrentFiberOwnerName()` because it used to only work for host components since I first added it when working on DOM invariants/warnings. The problem is it didn't report the owner name when the owner is the current fiber itself. This is now fixed with an explicit switch on fiber tag.\r\n\r\n@iamdustan Since you're looking at Fiber and warnings would you like to review this?",
