  "body": "The props `key` and `ref` are reserved by React, and used internally.  Component authors may attempt to access these properties (thinking they could read the value, as per https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5740).  We could use `Object.defineProperty` (in dev mode) to warn if `props.key` or `props.ref` is accessed, and point the user to a note/discussion somewhere.  That way, users who actually run into the issue will always get a timely message that sends them directly to the relevant explanation/discussion.\n\nThis would be a good first bug, if we decide we actually want to do it.\n",
