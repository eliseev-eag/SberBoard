  "body": "In React Native, [TouchableHighlight requires its children to forward 'setNativeProps'](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/97).  This is implemented in built-in components, but must be manually implemented for all custom components.\r\n\r\nThis causes big incompatibilities with a library like [Native Base](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase/issues/68), not to mention any custom components that the developer creates, [which is apparently a preferred pattern for theming](http://willowtreeapps.com/blog/react-native-tips-and-tricks-styling-in-js/):\r\n\r\n> For our projects, we create a common directory inside the main js directory. This folder houses commonly-reused components throughout the app. For example, we can declare common Text and Header components...\r\n\r\nIt could be remedied by making available a default ref `root` which points to the root node.  This would allow generic forwarding to be written into a base class, which other components could inherit from:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nsetNativeProps(props) {\r\n  this.refs.root.setNativeProps(props)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would essentially forward the props down the chain until we hit a \"concrete\" built-in component.  Any arguments against making a `root` ref available by default?",
