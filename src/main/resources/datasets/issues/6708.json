  "body": "I searched for this issue earlier and saw a mention of it, but I think this is different. I am using Immutable.js and have an Immutable.List() as my react children on react v15.0.2. This works fine in modern browsers. \n\nInside of IE 11, React will throw an invariant saying that objects are not valid react children. I do have a Symbol.iterator polyfill (using babel-polyfill). \n\nThe current solution is calling .toJS() in the children so that IE doesn't complain, but I am not sure if this is supposed to be happening.\n\nHere is a jsfiddle with what I am doing: https://jsfiddle.net/xehvnmt0/4/\n\nFor some reason, in IE 11 with the example it works. But with babel 6 and babel-polyfill it throws the error: \n\n<img width=\"1682\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-05-05 at 3 36 50 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/449136/15054785/2aa71592-12d7-11e6-93f2-1dc2acc13904.png\">\n\nNot sure why I can't reproduce in the fiddle, but when adding .toJS() onto the end of the list that error goes away on my site.\n",
