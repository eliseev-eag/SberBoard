  "body": "ReactBrowserEventEmitter has some handling for `onBlur` and `onFocus`.\n\nSee:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/94a3b0f8a304202bb7c4cc32286e404ac3cc9464/src/browser/ReactBrowserEventEmitter.js#L262-L293\n\nReact will first check if it can trap `focus` with a capturing event using `addEventListener`. If it can't and the browser supports `focusin` then it will use `focusin`.\n\nHowever there is a problem with this pattern. Internet Explorer implements `relatedTarget` on `focusin` and `focusout` but it does not implement it in `focus` and `blur`. As of IE 9, IE supports addEventListener and trapping capturing events.\n\nThis means that IE 8 and before React will have `relatedTarget` on `onFocus` and `onBlur` handlers. But in IE 9-11 `relatedTarget` will be null in React's `onFocus` and `onBlur` handlers even though IE would support it if `focusin` and `focusout` had been used.\n",
