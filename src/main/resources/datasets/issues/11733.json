  "body": "The goal is to remove the \"injection\" step at initialization. I find it confusing because we always have to look in three places: the configs, the initialization logic, and then the use of those properties. I think this is partly why the logic got so tangled by now.\r\n\r\nI'm starting by removing the `propertyInfo.*` properties one by one, replacing them with function calls. There might be better implementations—happy to revise them. In some cases it may seem like we'd have to repeat an attribute name a few more times than before, but I think it probably gzips well, and in any case I'll make sure the size is smaller or the same before merging.\r\n\r\nNote I'm not changing logic yet. There are a few oddities in how code paths differ based on whether `propertyInfo` exists—which ideally shouldn't be the case. I'll looking at that later.",
