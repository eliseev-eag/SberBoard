  "body": "Hopefully we'll get JSX namespacing soon for accessing components inside objects (https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/760). Then, technically, there is only one thing that JSX cannot do that vanilla JS can, using an object as props `MyComp(myObject)`.\n\nJSX is beautiful that's why I love it, `MyComp(myObject, <Child />)` is not, I would _much_ rather do `<MyComp {myObject}><Child /></MyComp>` or whatever syntax you prefer. To be clear, I'm _specifically and only_ talking about supporting an object, **no additional properties**.\n\nIt's still just sugar, but with this feature JSX is capable enough to do everything JS can, while still looking familiar and being more readable than its JS counterpart.\n\nAs I've mentioned before, I could take it upon me to implement this myself, it should be a relatively simple change.\n",
