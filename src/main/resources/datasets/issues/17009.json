Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nI made a screen recording of the current behavior: \r\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/ceeb458681774a9ebadc82732546ea54\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIt'd be great if the Component's element select tool would bring the undocked devTools into focus when selecting node.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nDevTools version: 4.1.3 (9/30/2019)\r\nBrowser: Chrome Version 77.0.3865.75 \r\nOS: OSX 10.14.5\r\n\r\nI don't recall if this worked in the previous React DevTools.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf this is a desired behavior I'd like to help contribute. If so, besides the contributing guidelines what files/docs would be a good to start tackling this? \r\n",
