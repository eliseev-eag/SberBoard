  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nPossible bug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI am attempting to \"lift state up\", by taking a string from a component and passing it to the parent component. \r\nThis is done by a function fired on the onSubmit event on a form in the child.\r\nThe value gets passed using the child's props to the parent, and then to the parent's state using this.setState().\r\nThe problem is that the state's property that I just updated is initially an array containing the string I pushed, which is OK, but then, on the parent's render() method, when I attempt to get this.state.nameOfTheArray, I get its length instead. I have reproduced the issue on a very minimal JSfiddle which I'll link below. By clicking the button you can view the issue in the console.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/degun/wbcv3zq1/2/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIn the render() method I should get the new array with the passed value.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI am using React 16.8.0. I tested the code on Firefox 65 and Chrome 71.0.3578.98 (Official Build) (64-bit) on a machine using Windows 10 64-bit.\r\n",
