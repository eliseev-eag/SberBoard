  "body": "Given that React can and is being used for server-side rendering, and that in a server context stores and dispatchers really need a context-based registry, and that components need to be able to pull context-based instances, not just a global/static instance, it would be extremely useful to be able to specify a global property of `React` that is a list of properties that are automatically passed from parent to child if not specified.\n\nex:\n\n```\n//app.js - loads app.jsx\nvar React = require('React');\nReact.addInheritingProperty('context');\n\n//app.jsx\nrender: function() {\n    <App context={instance}>\n        <Child>will have context for the instance</Child>\n    </App>\n}\n```\n\nThis would apply to rendering of {children} as well as specified controls rendered within a parent.  Right now, for example, using Yahoo's [fluxible-app](https://github.com/yahoo/fluxible-app) you need to explicitely pass context to all children that will use the router and store mixins for the purpose of using stores and the router components.\n\nBy making such a functionality available, instance registries for stores/dispatchers would be far easier to utilize.  They could simply specify a base property to use (ex `_my_store_registry_`) and simply use that against rendered instances.\n",
