  "body": "**bug report**\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe LICENSE is stated as MIT, but both `react` and `react-dom` have a GPL 2.0 dependency. So I think either the license is the wrong one (should be GPL) or this dependency should be changed.\r\n\r\nTo test it, use my package `legally`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpx legally react\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\n![licenses](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36914428/36888774-55d0ee94-1e3a-11e8-8a28-5f70508f864a.png)\r\n\r\nThe dependency is indirect: `react` => `fbjs` => `ua-parser-js`. Some devs say [your dependencies matter](https://medium.com/@vovabilonenko/licenses-of-npm-dependencies-bacaa00c8c65) and some others say [sarcastically that all code should be GPL then](https://samgentle.com/posts/2015-03-31-illegal-npm-modules). I am not a lawyer and have no lawyer department, so please feel free to close this if it's a non-issue. But I think having a GPL dependency is a no-go for many companies!\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nNo dependency is GPL licensed since that would make your user's code GPL. This GPL code is bundled and distributed with each of React's users' code, so potentially every React project that has included this dependency is GPL.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nCurrent version from the `package.json`.\r\n\r\n**Affects**\r\n\r\nThis also affects `react-dom` and of course `create-react-app` that I know of.\r\n\r\nNote: Feel free to close this and open it in `fbjs` repository, which I could not find. [The linked fbjs repository from npm](https://github.com/facebook/fbjs) is **clearly** not the original one, since npm states the dependencies of `fbjs` as `core-js, isomorphic-fetch, loose-envify, object-assign, promise, setimmediate, ua-parser-js` while [this repository tells a totally different story](https://github.com/facebook/fbjs/blob/master/package.json) (it is even private!). This is very strange [and reminds me to this horror story](https://hackernoon.com/im-harvesting-credit-card-numbers-and-passwords-from-your-site-here-s-how-9a8cb347c5b5), but of course there should be some legit reason for that, right?",
