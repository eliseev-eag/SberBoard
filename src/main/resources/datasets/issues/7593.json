  "body": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nBug\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\nUsing polyfilled ES6 `Map` on browsers without native Map support\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar**\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/t5ht7mmb/1/ â€“ `isNative` returns `true` on IE9\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nUsing objects instead of `Map`. While `isNative` method has been implemented in #7491 it can't detect core-js polyfills. Look at discussion in comments here: https://github.com/lodash/lodash/commit/e156459176c1f35964fc443b39f04c4cb0a96763#diff-001d0647fb00f8336795faccdec19a31R11199\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\n15.3.1\n",
