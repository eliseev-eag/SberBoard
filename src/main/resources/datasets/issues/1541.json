  "body": "Using `ReactCSSTransitionGroup`, if you background a tab and a transition happens, the warning for not actually adding a transition to the group is displayed in the console.\n\n_transition(): tried to perform an animation without an animationend or transitionend event after timeout (5000ms). You should either disable this transition in JS or add a CSS animation/transition._\n\nI've created a reproducible version of this [here](http://jsbin.com/cizupufo/1/).\n\nI believe this is due to a bug in pretty much all modern browsers where the `transitionend` and `animationend` events are not emitted when tabs are backgrounded. That said, I figured it was worth bringing up to see if React could do something about it.\n\nThoughts?\n",
