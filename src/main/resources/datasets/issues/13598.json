There don't appear to be [any call sites for `injectComponentTree` in www either](https://fburl.com/biggrep/a7rpw73t) (FB Internal).\r\n\r\nRNW *is* using `EventPluginHub` through ReactDOM's secret internals, but that was removed in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13539\r\n\r\nThis removes the unused `injectComponentTree` export, refactors the `ResponderEventPlugin` test so it doesn't depend on it, and also adds `EventPluginHub` to the exports to unbreak RNW with 16.5\r\n\r\ncc @necolas \r\n",
