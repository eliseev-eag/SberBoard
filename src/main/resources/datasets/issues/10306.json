  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug / Feature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nUsing new React v16-beta.1 for server-rendering, I'm using the regular `react-dom/server` package and the method `renderToString()`.\r\n\r\nThe HTML / DOM output which is created has a root element with an attribute `data-reactroot=\"\"` and all elements with the attribute `data-reactid=\"\"`. Having this on every single HTML element ends up consuming a lot of bytes on large pages and it seems like it potentially might not be necessary with the new client re-hydration? Or could at least be reduced in size since it appears that they serve no real purpose besides being a binary marker at this point?\r\n\r\nTo quote from the beta release notes:\r\n\r\n> Server rendering does not use markup validation anymore, and instead tries its best to attach to existing DOM, warning about inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nI see there is a new streaming server-renderer under `react-dom/node-stream` as well which I haven't managed to take a look at yet. But I expect these two methods of rendering to have the same output.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nNode.js v8.2.0 - React v16-beta.1\r\n\r\nEDIT: Just to quickly illustrate what I'm talking about better:\r\n\r\n![server-render-reactid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1508863/28668443-1a835630-72d0-11e7-94fb-121a7ab3297a.jpg)\r\n\r\nThat's 16 extra characters in each HTML element rendered by React. Just in this _very_ small example app, that's 16 * 53 = 848 characters.",
