  "body": "When I run react devtools on Chrome on https://www.getmyboat.com, it works just fine, but when I go to the same page with react devtools on Firefox, the icon is greyed out and it says the page doesn't appear to be using React.\r\n\r\nThe site uses a strict CSP policy - i.e. no unsafe-inline or unsafe-eval - so I'm wondering if it's something where Firefox treats extension code as injected code, where Chrome doesn't.\r\n\r\nIs this a known issue? I'm fine if it's a wontfix on account of some behavior of Firefox, but I'd like to know for sure that that's the case.\r\n\r\nEDIT: If it is a wontfix, I'll add something to the devtools docs to that effect.",
