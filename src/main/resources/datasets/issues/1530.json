However I'm not getting a warning in my console (Firefox Nightly) that says sync XHR is deprecated.\n\n> Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/\n\nLet's be preemptive and just build in the minimal work here to switch to async xhr and ensure we still process scripts in order.\n",
