  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nNeither\r\n\r\nThis issue is of great value as far as `react-virtualized` is concerened.\r\n\r\nSince `react-virtualized` causes Components to unmount once they are out of view. That also affects input elements. Meaning if there's a huge list of contacts and user is editing one entry through `HTMLInputElement` in the list itself. The moment, a user scrolls a bit up or down, that `input` gets unmounted and the entire input state (textValue, undo/redo history) is lost. Not very cool.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to trying to put together an \"HOC\" that under the hood uses \"manually\" constructed `HTMLInputElement` that lives on until user actually cancels the editing. When the component is (re)mounted and `componentDidMount` fires, that \"manual\" input then replaces contents of `Component#render` to make things work!\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nEverything works as intended! (but worried about the future)\r\n\r\n1. I'm manually overwriting the `current` property on `React.RefObject` to achieve pseudo-ref-forwarding. (Making the `ref.current` point to an HTMLElement that's \"manually\" injected into DOM)\r\n\r\n2. Replacing the HTMLElement output by Component's render method with an element created \"manually\", and reversing the operation in `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle. For safety, and to avoid confusing React, `shouldComponentUpdate` __always__ returns false.\r\n\r\nBoth of the operations above work nominally as of React `16.*`. **What is the probability that future versions of React will prevent either of those things from happening?**\r\n\r\nHere's how it works: https://codesandbox.io/s/50ryqojnnn\r\n\r\nApologies if this question should belong elsewhere (I really wanted to hear from core team)",
