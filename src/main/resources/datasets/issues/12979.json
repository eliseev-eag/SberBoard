Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nWhen render() executed immediately after being called, it followed a code path through shouldComponentUpdate(), and when it has delayed execution because of non-unique props, it followed a code path through componentWillMount().\r\n\r\nWhen it worked: shouldComponentUpdate() immediately ran after calling ReactDOM.render(childcomponent, parentcomponent);.\r\n\r\nWhen it didn't work: componentWillMount() ran after the current function of the parentcomponent had finished executing.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this is insufficient info.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIn ReactJS, 15.6.2, render() always runs, and runs immediately, whether its props are unique or not.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThis was last working in 15.6.2.  It is not working in 16.4.0.\r\n",
