  "body": "Talked with @spicyj in the chat a while back and we both agreed that something like `shouldComponentUpdate` but for whether the component should simulate `unmount` + `mount` would sometimes be great. A means of resolving confusion when two components of the same type, but with completely different data, would normally be considered the same (say `postid = 1` and `postid = 2`).\n\n@zpao Briefly mentioned that one could wrap the component with and provide a `key`, but that is really quite a hack, as the two components would have to be intricately bound. Any methods put in the outer, the outer possibly reading state from the inner. Also quite tedious.\n### Background\n\nIn my opinion, `key` is a solution to reconciling reordered children, it is **not** synonymous with the identity of the component. `key` could be the index into an array of `user` objects each with their own `userid`s. Thus, when a `user` is replaced in the array, the `user`-component would update (rather than remount), because the `key` is identical even though `userid` is not. It's also something that should decided and handled by the component itself, as opposed to its parent.\n\nSpeaking to @zpao he seemed to agree, but couldn't see much use for it himself. I believe there are definite use-cases like `user`s in an array above, but primarily for third-party integration and reusable components.\n### Alternatives\n\nThis could be simulated using a mixin that simply invokes the full `unmount` + `mount` chain of methods on the component, and `this.replaceState(this.getInitialState())`, but any DOM inputs would incorrectly remain unless you also assign an identity-`key` to the root node, the component itself could also still be dirty. I feel that this is an issue that should be addressed properly by React, and it's a minor change too I believe (although it intersects significantly with `shouldComponentUpdate` so some refactoring may be advisable).\n### Naming\n\n`shouldComponentReceive` is probably a shitty name, I feel like it should remain true to `shouldComponentUpdate` with `return true` meaning `no change` and thus being in the form of \"is this really me?\" rather than \"should I kill myself?\".\n",
