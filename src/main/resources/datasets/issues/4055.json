  "body": "I am currently writing code to traverse through a form with all its inputs - this to collect form data for a PUT. I'm almost there but there is one problem left: children aren't always populated.\n\nI have something like this recursive function in coffee to collect all form children:\n\n``` coffee\n_collectAllChildren: (target) ->\n  children = []\n  React.Children.forEach(target.props.children, (child) =>\n    children.push(child)\n\n    if child.props.children\n      children = children.concat(@_collectAllChildren(child))\n  )\n  children\n```\n\nBut inside one form component, I have nested React elements (using React bootstrap) like this one called `FirstLastNameInput`:\n\n``` cjsx\n  render: ->\n    <Row className = {@props.rowClassName}>\n      <Input\n        hasFeedback\n        required\n        md               = 6\n        type             = 'text'\n        name             = 'firstName'\n        value            = @props.firstName\n      />\n      <Input\n        hasFeedback\n        required\n        md               = 6\n        type             = 'text'\n        name             = 'lastName'\n        value            = @props.lastName\n      />\n    </Row>\n```\n\nand here is the problem. When `_collectAllChildren` tries to collect all children for FirstLastNameInput, then it has no children but I wish `@props.children` would return the properties of these two Inputs anyway.\n\nThis would make things a lot easier and prevents me from doing dirty React hacks.\n",
