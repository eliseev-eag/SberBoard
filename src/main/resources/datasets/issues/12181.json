  "body": "Proposed solution for supporting the `!important` priority for inline styles (#1881). I couldn't write a test for this change; it looks like jsdom doesn't fully support the browser APIs being used. Please let me know if you've got any ideas.\r\n\r\nI used RNW's early-warning [benchmarks](necolas.github.io/react-native-web/benchmarks) to check how this change affects the `inline-styles` timings in Chrome. I couldn't see any difference when styles don't use `!important`. There is a 10-15% increase in time taken when every node in the tree (>600) has at least one style value using `!important` and going through the new code path. Overall it looks like it avoids introducing a performance regression for existing using of `style` while enabling use of `!important` if needed.\r\n\r\n[A micro-optimization](https://github.com/facebook/fbjs/pull/282) PR for `hyphenateStyleName` in `fbjs` helps a little too.\r\n\r\n(This patch is related to #12179, which adds a warning when `!important` is used.)",
