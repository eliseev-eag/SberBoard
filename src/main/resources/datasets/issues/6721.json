  "body": "ReactDOM already has the `unmountComponentAtNode` function. I think it would be useful if there was a similar utility function that simply let you _get_ the component instance at a particular DOM node.\n\nIt would allow you to guard `unmountComponentAtNode` calls, and also help folks who need lots of interop between non-React code and React code. Furthermore, it seems like a good function to have for the sake of ReactDOM API \"completeness\".\n\nPerhaps could be named `getComponentAtNode`? Or `findComponent` (to be similar to `findDOMNode`)?\n\nHappy to start working on a PR for you if y'all like the idea.\n",
