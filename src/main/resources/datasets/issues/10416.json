  "body": "The downside of merging https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10385 is that we don’t know if we have internal callsites that would break because of `toString` once we start passing attributes through. This is not a problem in open source where we’ve had a warning for a long time.\r\n\r\nI propose we add this warning now, and let it live for a few days. Then look at the top callsites, and how many there are (and if they are benign or if calling `toString` could cause issues). ",
