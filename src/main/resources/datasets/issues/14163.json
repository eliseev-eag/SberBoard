Instead, I see DOM nodes for both.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/o2gmd9wk/1/ (watch the output panel)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe DOM should match my React component tree.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nTested on Windows, Chrome 71 and React 16.6.1.",
