  "body": "Hi there âœ‹ \r\n\r\nWe use react-virtualize to render a list.  A sub component of a row carries some state. This state obviously gets reinitialized on every remount. \r\nCan we just store the state on the parent in object, pass this object down the tree by props and then set this object every time we do a state update? \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nprops : {\r\n     stateCache: {\r\n          childState: {} \r\n     }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nconstructor(props) {\r\n      super(props)\r\n      this.state = props.stateCache.childState;\r\n}\r\n...\r\nthis.setState({property: 2}, () => this.props.stateCache.childState = this.state)\r\n```",
