  "body": "Hello React team. With the release of `0.14.0-beta1` and the separation of the rendering logic from React's core, I started scaffolding a custom renderer for the [blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed) library, used to create terminal interfaces. [Here](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/react-blessed) is therefore the WIP but nonetheless working version of `react-blessed`.\n\nThis issue is therefore a way for me to give you some feedback on the creation of custom renderers, to ask you for some advice and to check whether I did things correctly and in a way you would deem to be the right one.\n\nHere are the steps I followed:\n- I created a `ReactBlessedComponent` and `ReactBlessedTextComponent` based respectively upon `ReactDOMComponent` and `ReactDOMTextComponent`.\n- I creared a `ReactBlessedReconcileTransaction` mimicking the behavior of `ReactReconcileTransaction`.\n- I created an injection file that basically does the following:\n\n``` js\nReactInjection.NativeComponent.injectGenericComponentClass(\n  ReactBlessedComponent\n);\n\nReactInjection.NativeComponent.injectTextComponentClass(\n  ReactBlessedTextComponent\n);\n\nReactInjection.Updates.injectReconcileTransaction(\n  ReactBlessedReconcileTransaction\n);\n```\n- I created an endpoint for the renderer exposing a simple function taking a React valid element and a blessed `screen` options based on what `ReactServerRendering` would do.\n- I had to override `ReactComponentEnvironment.processChildrenUpdates` and set it to a noop so my updates can work without the DOM.\n\nSo now I have a working renderer with working state, reconciliation, refs, events etc.\n\nIs there things I would have missed and that would break the renderer at some point?\n",
