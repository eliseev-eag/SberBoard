  "body": "Previously, we had to use the context method `getEventCurrentTarget` to find the current event target. We can optimize this significantly by providing it on the `event` responder object passed to responder method callbacks. This way, we don't need to call `getEventCurrentTarget` and do more work than needed. From this, I noticed that we also didn't guard against `document` elements being the target (rare, granted – but possible). You can't call a bunch of the methods we use on `document` so this would result in JS errors at runtime.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that the RN codepath diverged from the ReactDOM version – so I took this opportunity to align them.",
