  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nbug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIf a DOM element rendered by a React component has focus, and the React component unmounts, the React `onBlur` event does not fire on parent DOM elements.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/134wrzy6q7\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would expect that, just like the browser fires a `focusout` event when removing a DOM node, React would fire an `onBlur` events up to parent nodes when the focused node is removed / unmounted.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact: 16.2\r\nMac OS X: 10.13.2\r\nBrowser: Chrome 67.0.3366.0, Chrome 64.0.3282.186\r\n\r\nNo idea if this worked in earlier versions of React.",
