  "body": "This adds a bunch of new stuff related to the build process for the new server renderer (Fizz).\r\n\r\nIt adds a new package `react-stream`. The name is temporary (but is nicely owned by @aickin).\r\n\r\nThis is equivalent to `react-reconciler` but for server rendering. I considered putting them in the same package but they really shouldn't share anything and splitting them up into folders just make both seem more complicated.\r\n\r\nThis is used to create a two new entry points.\r\n\r\n`react-dom/unstable-fizz` which is a server renderer for DOM. Can run in Node for Node streams or browsers for WHATWG streams.\r\n\r\nThere is also a `react-noop-rendering/server` for tests.\r\n\r\nThe interesting new twist here is that there is not just a HostConfig (Node.js, Service Worker, other). There's also a FormatConfig (DOM, RN, possibly variations of DOM).\r\n\r\nCurrently I just copy pasted all the FiberHostConfig overrides to also account for FizzHostConfig and FizzFormatConfig.\r\n\r\nThe `inlinedHostConfigs.js` model starts breaking down though. Currently the `dom` configuration tests the DOM format config + Node host config. However, that means we wouldn't get coverage on DOM format config + Service Worker host config. Maybe that's fine as long as the Service Worker host config is covered by one of the other configurations?",
