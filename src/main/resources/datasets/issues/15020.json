  "body": "This bug is pretty confusing:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1102659818660102145\r\n\r\nI think it happens because `fn` scheduled by `setInterval(fn, 0)` jumps in front of the `[running]` effect cleanup caused by `setRunning(false)`. So the interval still fires, overwriting `setLapse(0)` that happened during the event with its `setLapse(someValue)`.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of the issue described in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14750#issuecomment-460409609, or at least a part of it:\r\n\r\n>In fact, this problem exists even for regular React keystrokes (and other “discrete” events). The solution to that would be to flush passive effects before we get a discrete event.\r\n\r\nBut here, it seems like this wouldn’t be sufficient because the effect flips *as a result* of the click, not before it. So should `setState` inside a discrete event *also* flush passive effect? Seems like not. (That would defeat the purpose of delaying them.)\r\n\r\nSo this is working as designed, and the fix is just `useLayoutEffect` when the timing matters? Or the rAF solution?",
