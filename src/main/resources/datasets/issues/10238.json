I need to fixup my branch at least.\n\n- Removes onClick logic for radio and checkboxes, believe that was ie8 only\n\n- removes a substantial chunk of of the input polypill. ie9 partially supports onInput already, and we only need to add in the selection change event to handle the cases it doesn’t work on, e.g. deleting text\n\nFor everything else we don’t distinguish between when to use change vs input (such as for select inputs) since we listen to both and dedupe.\n\nI tested against the fixtures on IE9 with positive results!",
