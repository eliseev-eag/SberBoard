  "body": "If you attach a `ref` to an element using a string (`ref='foo'`) and use `ReactTestRenderer` you get the `\"Stateless function components cannot be given refs\"` warning\n\nSee https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7371#issuecomment-237816352\n\nThis is because `getPublicInstance` returns `null` and `attachRef` requires that the instance be non-null in the warning invariant.\n\nI think we can either return a simple instance instead of `null` or use some additional check in `attachRef` to see if we're dealing with `ReactTestRenderer`. The first option seems reasonable, given the comment in the current code: \n\n``` js\nReactTestComponent.prototype.getPublicInstance = function() {\n  // I can't say this makes a ton of sense but it seems better than throwing.\n  // Maybe we'll revise later if someone has a good use case.\n  return null;\n};\n```\n\ncc @spicyj \n",
