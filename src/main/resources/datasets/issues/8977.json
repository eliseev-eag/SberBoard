  "body": "I'm using ARIA role=button on some div elements. They are disabled at times, but the disabled attribute is being ignored by React and the onClick event is being triggered. \r\n\r\nI've created a fiddle illustrating the issue: https://jsfiddle.net/joshbroton/mr7gn5vv/8/\r\n\r\nI'd expect that onClick would not be triggered on elements when disabled={true}, especially if role=\"button\". \r\n\r\nI am using React 15.4.1. JSFiddle is 15.4.2.\r\n",
