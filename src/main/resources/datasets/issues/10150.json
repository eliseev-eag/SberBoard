  "body": "This commit is a follow up to prior work to resolve issues with number inputs in React:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7359#discussion_r108826984\r\n\r\n**More or less**\r\n\r\nA can of worms :). The discussion above concluded that React should not synchronize the value attribute/checked attribute for controlled inputs. This PR makes that change.\r\n\r\n**More info**\r\n\r\nCurrently, inputs keep their value/checked attribute in sync with the value/checked property. This is a React behavior. Traditionally browser DOM manipulation does not rely on keeping the value/checked attribute in sync.\r\n\r\nIt's also very problematic for number inputs and (I believe) a few other obscure input bugs in IE/iOS Safari (this needs to be confirmed). After discussion, it was decided to make a breaking change to no longer sync up the value/checked attribute with it's associated property.\r\n\r\nFor this to work, I made the following changes:\r\n\r\n- The `value`, `defaultValue`, `checked` and `defaultChecked` properties are now maintained within the HTML property config. `defaultValue` maps to the `value` attribute, as does `defaultChecked` to `checked`\r\n- ☝️ required adding a filter to strip out the value property on selects and textareas\r\n- The logic to defer assignment of the value attribute has been removed form ChangeEventPlugin\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## How to test this change\r\n\r\nI've pushed a build of this version of React for our DOM fixtures here:\r\n\r\nhttp://nh-no-input-value-attribute.surge.sh",
