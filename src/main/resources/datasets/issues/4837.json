  "body": "Hi,\n\nI was checking the file of the definition of [forEachAccumulated](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/04e5ee70cc99797a048aeca151b0af595ea48af6/src/shared/utils/forEachAccumulated.js#L21-L27) and I saw that the documentation entry is vague about the case that `arr` is `0`, or `\"\"`, in which it doesn't call `cb`.\n\nAs this function is used basically with events (or queues), probably this is not an expected value, but maybe it would be nice to comment that the function expects objects, and not `items`. What do you think? Would you leave it as it is, change the docs or ensure that the item is an object at the `else if`?\n\nCheers\n",
