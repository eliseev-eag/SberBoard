  "body": "There is a thought that boggles my mind that I'd like to share and see if anyone feels the same.\r\n\r\nHigher order function is a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a third function.\r\n\r\nWhat we call a HOC takes a component and returns a component.\r\n\r\nBut what is a component? It's a function that takes **props** and returns **nodes/elements**. Props in, nodes out, that's the definition. But HOC does not take **props** and does not return **nodes/elements**, so it can be higher-order-_whatever_, but not a _component_.\r\n\r\nWe even define it starting with a lowercase letter (`function withSomething(Component) {}`); we don't name it in PascalCase like we do with actual components, and we don't try to use it as tag names in JSX, so we all are pretty sure **HOC is not a component**. Then why do we call it so?\r\n\r\nMaybe, a \"component factory\" instead of \"HOC\" would be a better name.\r\n\r\nOf course the term HOC is a widely a used name, but it's confusing because the word \"component\" is misused.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",
