  "body": "Simplifies markup generation by only inserting a simple comments between consecutive text nodes.\r\n\r\nI also skip past comments and other nodes while hydrating. This leaves them in place instead of being removed by the hydration mechanism. This is more efficient but will also be needed by hydration validator.\r\n\r\nThere's a special case for empty strings. We probably shouldn't have nodes for those at all. For now I special case it by assuming there won't be one so if we need one, we'll insert an empty text node.\r\n\r\nI also dropped the ID part from the `data-reactid` attribute. We'll remove the whole thing later.",
