  "body": "Duplicate of : #14583\r\n\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIssue loading the js chunk files on IE11 (only). With the latest version of react 16.7.0 our app (which uses Suspense and Lazy) doesn't load all the needed js chunks. You need to navigate around the app to request other js chunks and eventually the app is fully loaded.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nWe have a routes.js file with all the routes of the app. It looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst Organisation = lazy(() => import('./pages/Organisation'));\r\nconst Services = lazy(() => import('./pages/Services'));\r\n// all the other dynamic imports go here\r\n// ...\r\nconst Page404 = lazy(() => import('./pages/Page404'));\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default (\r\n  <ErrorBoundary>\r\n    <Suspense fallback={<span />}>\r\n      <Switch>\r\n        <Redirect exact from=\"/\" to=\"/organisation\" />\r\n        <Route path=\"/organisation\" component={Organisation} />\r\n        <Route path=\"/services\" component={Services} />\r\n              <!-- All the other routes -->\r\n        <Route path=\"*\" component={Page404} />\r\n      </Switch>\r\n    </Suspense>\r\n  </ErrorBoundary>\r\n);\r\n```\r\nThe route \"/\" is redirected to \"/organisation\" which returns the \"Organisation\" component. However, the Organisation component is not rendered, the chunk hasn't been requested on demand. If we navigate to \"/services\" the services chunk is requested on demand and loaded well. Then, if we go back to \"/organisation\" all is fine.\r\n\r\nThere are no shown errors at all. \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe js chunks are requested on demand loaded and the components are rendered when we initially load the app.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThis worked in all previous version of React that we tried since Lazy and Suspense was released in 16.3.0\r\n\r\nReact version: 16.7.0\r\nOS: Win7\r\nBrowser: IE11",
