  "body": "I want to report a bug for the hooks plugin.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThere was no error report after running eslint, but the component failed when running in the browser.\r\nFrom the chrome dev console it reported \"Uncaught Error: Rendered fewer hooks than expected. This may be caused by an accidental early return statement.\" \r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.\r\nHere is a link to the github repo:\r\nhttps://github.com/paboulos/react-hooks-eslint\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nFollowed The Hooks API guide which says React hooks provides a linter plugin to enforce these rules automatically.Therefore it should have reported a usage violation when the eslint hooks plugin is specified. \r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nUsing window 10 OS and Chrome browser.\r\n1. First ran npx create-react-app Hooks\r\n2. Installed react 16.7.0-alpha.2 and react-dom 16.7.0-alpha.2\r\n3. Installed eslint dev dependencies:\r\n \"babel-eslint\": \"9.0.0\",\r\n    \"babel-loader\": \"8.0.4\",\r\n    \"eslint\": \"5.9.0\",\r\n    \"eslint-config-airbnb\": \"17.1.0\",\r\n    \"eslint-loader\": \"2.1.1\",\r\n    \"eslint-plugin-import\": \"2.14.0\",\r\n    \"eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y\": \"6.1.2\",\r\n    \"eslint-plugin-react\": \"7.11.1\",\r\n    \"eslint-plugin-react-hooks\": \"0.0.0\"\r\n4. Created the .eslintrc.json following the instructions from the Hooks API Doc\r\nThen ran package script lint as follows: \"npm run lint\"\r\nno errors reported.\r\nThen ran package script start as follows: \"npm start\"\r\nThe React component CountHooks calls useState incorrectly and reports error in the browser dev console.",
