  "body": "Hi!\n\nI'm getting an initial blink while using ReactCSSTransitionGroup because the added element does not get the -enter class applied when it's attached to the DOM, even if it gets it immediately after.\n\nFor what I can see, the ReactCSSTransitionGroupChild.componentWillEnter is queued and dispatched after the action that adds the element to the DOM, which causes this behavior.\n\nIs this a know issue? Wouldn't it make sense for the element to be added with the -enter class at the moment it's inserted?\n\nThanks!\n",
