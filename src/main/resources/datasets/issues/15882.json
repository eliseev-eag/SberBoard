  "body": "Follow up to #15861.\r\n\r\nTurns out you can't set `!important` using a normal property assignment. You have to use `style.setProperty`.\r\n\r\nMaybe Andrew *should* just learn CSS.\r\n\r\nIE9 doesn't support `style.setProperty` so we'll fall back to setting `display: none` without `important`, like we did before #15861. Our advice for apps that need to support IE9 will be to avoid using `!important`. Which seems like good advice in general, but IANACSSE.\r\n\r\nTested on FB and using our Suspense DOM fixture.",
