  "body": "An app I'm building requires a `select` with a lot of `option`s, and they are all checked by default. There appears to be an issue with React's performance for this situation.\n\n[Here's a JSFiddle.](https://jsfiddle.net/ach1d7x9/) It builds a `select` with 500 options, all selected, and takes over a second to run on my computer. If you remove `defaultValues`, you can see that it runs almost instantly. And if you set it to 5000 options, it takes over 2 minutes to run for me. \n\nThe problem appears to get exponentially worse the more selected options you have. I realize that this is an edge case, but it also seems like a bug to me.\n",
