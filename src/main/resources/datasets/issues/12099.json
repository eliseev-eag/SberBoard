  "body": "Currently we're doing string manipulation outside React (Starring [_classnames_](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames)) and it works perfectly, but after a while writing code, it feels a little verbose:\r\n```jsx\r\n<div className={classnames({ ... })}> ... </div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe prop `className` is a plain string because it's directly mapped to DOM _Element_ property.\r\n\r\nLet's not create a polymorphic Frankenstein here. Keep it as close to pure JS/DOM as possible. My suggestion is not about changing, but adding.\r\n\r\nSince a long time ago (not for Microsoft), DOM _Element_ has the `classList` method. It works greatly for direct manipulation, but it wouldn't fit JSX declarative syntax.\r\n\r\nHow about extending the components with a `classMap` prop, that would work pretty much like _classnames_, mapping class names keys to conditional values.\r\n\r\nUpon rendering that component, React would merge `classNames` and `classMap` into a single string to be passed down the render as the good old plain string `classNames`.\r\n\r\nAngular has something like this for a long time:\r\n- `class` prop is a plain string;\r\n- [`ngClass`](https://angular.io/api/common/NgClass) directive makes the magic.",
