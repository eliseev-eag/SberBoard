Use the latest available v15.* prop-types package from npm instead. For info on usage, compatibility, migration and more, see https://fb.me/prop-types-docs\r\nWarning: Accessing createClass via the main React package is deprecated, and will be removed in React v16.0. Use a plain JavaScript class instead. If you're not yet ready to migrate, create-react-class v15.* is available on npm as a temporary, drop-in replacement. For more info see https://fb.me/react-create-class\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can use this with babel:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from \"react\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works because of synthetic import support in babel, using `__esModule`.\r\n\r\nIf you use TypeScript the above does not work unless you set `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` to true in tsconfig.json.\r\n\r\nMost packages work fine with `* as Module`, but React's deprecated warnings get tripped because babel copies the object with `_interopRequireWildcard`.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from \"react\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above should work without needing to set `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`. This can be done by providing a `default` property.\r\n\r\nPossibly by adding this to `src/isomorphic/ReactEntry.js`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nReact.default = React\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 15.6.1\r\nChrome 59\r\nOS X 10.12.5\r\nNode 8.1.2\r\n\r\nDoes not work in previous versions since deprecation warning was added.",
