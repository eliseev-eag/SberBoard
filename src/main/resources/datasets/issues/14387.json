Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React:**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/qkzl9xjj44\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIn this example, the effect should only be run once, not re-run (and thus cleaned up) upon clicking the button for the first time. The `isActive` state should be returned to false on mouseup. `CLEAN UP!` should not be logged to the console since the ref hasn't been reassigned.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16.7.0-alpha.2 (affects all environments)",
