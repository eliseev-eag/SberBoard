  "body": "Hello! I've been using React and combining it with Browserify. My goal for this was to be able to use Node modules with React, by using this workflow:\n1. Write JSX logic, include require()'s to installed Node modules\n2. Use react-tools to compile the JSX to JS\n3. Browserify said JS, which would then include the Node modules\n\nHowever, the compiled JSX from react-tools changes something like `require('foo')` to `require('./foo')`, and creates a stub file. This very much breaks importing modules. This seems to happens because of `commoner`, which is part of the compiling workflow.\n\nIs there a workaround for this? \n",
