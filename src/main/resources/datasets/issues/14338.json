  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am writing an application that keeps track of a bunch of component instances. For context, each mounted or could-be-mounted component instance requires reserved memory on a server. In the interest of saving memory, I would like know when a component has been unmounted for the last time (i.e. will never be re-mounted). Is it possible to know this from user-land? And does React even know this information?\r\n\r\nIdeally this could be exposed as a \"destructor\" method call, though I understand why that would be discouraged.",
