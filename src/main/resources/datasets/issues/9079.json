But, when I git clone react, I discovered the project is so HUGE lead to much slower when I cloned and forked.\r\n\r\n   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6913898/23400759/0a320174-fde0-11e6-9c4a-e4026ac6946b.png)\r\n\r\n  The docs folder have the 50M size, and the **.git** folder have the 113M because of the docs i think. And I just want the **src** folder which only have the 3.5M.\r\n\r\n  There also are some project like vue, webpack to split the doc from repository itself.",
