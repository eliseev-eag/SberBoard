  "body": "Alternative approach to #10641. Rather than create the entire packaging and bundling script this exposes the React Reconciler as a factory package so all private+global state is unique per reconciler which solves the original concerns raised by @gaearon in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9103#issuecomment-319750290.\r\n\r\nI think it also solves the open question *How should we handle React-specific stuff* pretty well since it doesnâ€™t change the current rollup/build script at this point.\r\n\r\nI added a really cheap `fixtures/reconciler/*` directory that requires some manual `node_modules/react-reconciler/cjs/*.js` modifications to test for now, but did test both versions.\r\n\r\nThis also (rather sloppily) modifies the `scripts/rollup` tasks to special case the `react-reconciler` wrapping.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Generate a `react-reconciler.js.flow` file in the output package so external reconcilers can use flow for writing and maintaining reconcilers.\r\n- [x] Versioning scheme? I would suspect this to have separate versioning from React and ReactDOM (https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10758#discussion_r140011585)\r\n- [x] Change rollup/bundle regex match to a bundle type enum https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10758#discussion_r140012249\r\n- [x] Unbreak the build\r\n\r\ncc @gaearon  @bvaughn ",
