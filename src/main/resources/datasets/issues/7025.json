  "body": "I hope this is the correct place to file this issue, its definitely related to the ReactCSSTransitionGroup but it could be also related to React Router.\n\nIm using React Router with ReactCSSTransitionGroup in order to provide an animation while the user navigates between routes in my app (for instance to provide a nice fancy login animation). I also use a HOC library I wrote ([redux-auth-wrapper](https://github.com/mjrussell/redux-auth-wrapper)) to secure my routes with authentication/authorization checks. The HOC performs redirects by using redux state data about user authentication and dispatching redirects (typically via redux actions but can use the React Router context as well).\n\nIn 15.0.2 the HOC works perfectly and then upon upgrading to 15.1 there are infinite redirection loops. \n\nIts not clear to me if using the transition group in this way is wrong, obviously a concern is that both the pages are briefly rendered and the HOC (which uses componentWillMount/componentWillReceiveProps to trigger the redirect) is forcing another redirection. But it seems like the cWRP is being called as it is trying to be unmounted and is continually causing cWRP to triggered.\n\nI've created a sample repo at https://github.com/mjrussell/react-css-transition. When you use the master branch, everything works as expected (click to the Foo link and type user name and then should the welcome text) then, moving to the the `15_1-upgrade` branch and re-npm install and try to perform the same process will result in an infinite redirect loop (beware of crashing your tab/browser). I typically open a new window, open chrome dev tools and as soon as it loads and starts looping using the pause script button in the console.\n\nI've only tested this in Chrome version `51.0.2704.84`\n\nThanks! Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help\n",
