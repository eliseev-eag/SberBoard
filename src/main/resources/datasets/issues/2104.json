  "body": "Here is an example of how `<ReactCSSTransitionGroup>` is explained in the README:\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/deadlyicon/kb3gN/4984/\n\nIt works. \n\nHere is that same example except I've added a `componentDidMount` method that focuses a button within the component being transitioned:\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/deadlyicon/kb3gN/4985/\n\nNotice how the `enter` transition fails to animate.\n\nThis is possibly a browser bug but I thought I'd let you know anyway. \n\nIt's also worth noting that this bug can be worked around by moving the `transition` out of `.example-enter` and into `.example-enter.example-enter-active` like so:\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/deadlyicon/kb3gN/4986/\n\nHope this helps improve React :D \n",
