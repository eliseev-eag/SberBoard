  "body": "This is a small patch to react-refresh babel plugin to fix a problem we found in [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/issues/1268).\r\n\r\nIn short - refresh babel plugin is using the \"original\" _babel node_ to put a custom hook into `signature`, and `common-js` babel plugin has a logical condition not to transform any node twice. As a result - custom hook reference would not be transformed. @dgreensp did an amazing job finding the root cause.\r\n\r\nSolution - just `clone` node before the use. Look like there is no need for deep clone in this case.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind - __no tests were added__. Unfortunately, this bug is not reproducible with babel 6, and only babel 7 is affected. To be more concrete - I've added tests, but as long as they are not testing anything - they are passing initially - I've removed them.",
