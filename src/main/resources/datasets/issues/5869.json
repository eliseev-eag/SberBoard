  "body": "I know 0.15.0 no longer uses keys in `data-reactids` which is part of my issue however I'd like to bring forward a different way to link the dom for the initial render which is to keep text nodes and regular nodes separate.\n\nI have implemented something like this in my own simple virtual dom here https://github.com/DylanPiercey/tusk/blob/master/lib/virtual/node.js#L80 and here https://github.com/DylanPiercey/tusk/blob/master/lib/virtual/text.js#L37\n\nI am not sure if react works this way at all but essentially it recursively mounts nodes from the top down and splits up text nodes using `splitText` to ensure that the server produced dom matches the virtual structure.\n\nJust curious if something like this is feasible in react since it has allowed me to implement bootstrapping server side code while producing clean html output without checksums or ids.\n",
