  "body": "Does it make sense to use `memo` + `useState`?\r\n```js\r\nconst Dunno = memo(({a}) => {\r\n  const [b, setB] = useState(0);\r\n...\r\n```\r\nIf it doesn't, why the component updates when `setB` is called? ðŸ¤” \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/react-dxosdw\r\nhttps://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo\r\n> If your function component renders the same result **given the same props**, you can wrap it in a call to React.memo for a performance boost in some cases by memoizing the result. This means that React will **skip rendering the component, and reuse the last rendered result**.",
