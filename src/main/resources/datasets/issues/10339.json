  "body": "First attempt at https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10189.\r\n\r\n* Removes `data-reactid` from new SSR.\r\n* We now use presence of `data-reactroot` as heuristic for hydration.\r\n* There is also an explicit `ReactDOM.hydrate()` API that never clears the existing content.\r\n* `ReactDOM.render()` will now print a deprecation message when it tries to reuse markup.\r\n* Downgrade deprecation message to `lowPriorityWarning`.\r\n* A warning if we tried to hydrate but there’s no DOM to hydrate into.\r\n\r\nThis means `ReactDOM.render()` would still attempt to hydrate when there’s an element root, but might not work for new features (like top level strings or fragments). `ReactDOM.hydrate()` would always hydrate.\r\n\r\nI have switched the integration test to use the new hydration API when available, and this let me remove the special case for top level text nodes that I added in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10333.\r\n",
