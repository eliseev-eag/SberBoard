  "body": "We have a 15.0.3-dev branch and a 15.1.0-dev branch (each published as an alpha). React Native is using 15.1.0-alpha in master and soon to be (already cut?) 0.27-rc. Ideally we wouldn't ship 15.1.0 as is and would get more into it, however it's a real risk to RN to churn while they're in RC. While we could say \"that's tough shit, you used an alpha\", that's really not cool, we're all a big happy family and we should work together ♥️ (and we told them to use an alpha).\n\nSo even if I don't think we should do it in an ideal work, pragmatically we should probably just publish what we already have as final. Since we have 15.0.3 with patch fixes and 15.1.0 on top of that, we can ship both easily.\n\n15.0.3 changes: https://github.com/facebook/react/compare/846b5ea252108d104ab1b67f99879459ef591851...d8d6c7a07b6f0b5015286b62fdb0c5b59a243c13\n15.1.0 changes (on top of 15.0.3): https://github.com/facebook/react/compare/d8d6c7a07b6f0b5015286b62fdb0c5b59a243c13...7da88845814fd186e30f657588ea28d20916c6d1\n\nLonger term I don't think shipping and maintaining multiple releases is really tenable for us so it's doubtful we'd ship 15.0.4 (outside of a security release). We will need to properly plan what our cadence is and consider a train-like model. That's tangential to the decision here though so I'll write this down my thoughts on this later and we can discuss wherever that is.\n\nA couple related discussions: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6738 & https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/7385\n",
