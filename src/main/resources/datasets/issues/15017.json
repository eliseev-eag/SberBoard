  "body": "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI want to report an improvement or a missing documented guidance (if there is already a solution to this problem). I couldn't find a solution so far by looking in the docs or other issues. The only related link to this problem might be this one where the solution is a hacky workaround which does not work for dynamic defined arrays: https://dev.to/ajsharp/-an-array-of-react-refs-pnf\r\n\r\n*The actual problem:*\r\nBefore the new `createRef` API it was possible to create a map with the shape `{[id]: ref}`. In my render function I was able to to spawn a list of elements and store their reference in this map. For the new way of defining references I need to generate the \"storage\" for references in advance (in the constructor). Since my elements are defined and changed by props I would need to regenerate this collection of references each time before they are actually rendered. Since \"componentWillUpdate\" is deprecated I don't have a chance to recreate those references and link them in my render functions.\r\n\r\nFor more clarification on my problem here is a short example how this could work right now with componentWillUpdate: https://jsfiddle.net/zqxw6Lg4/3/\r\n\r\nI need those references because I want to scroll specific components in this list afterwards.\r\n\r\nVersions:\r\n- react: \"16.6.3\"\r\n- react-dom: \"16.6.3\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\nThomas\r\n",
