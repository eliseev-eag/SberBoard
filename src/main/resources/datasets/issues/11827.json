Have a React component render a number input: `<input type=\"number\" />`.\r\n2. Attach that React component as part of the ShadowDOM node of a custom element.\r\n3. Enter in some decimal value (e.g., `88.88`) into the input.\r\n4. Slowly backspace in the input. As soon as the decimal point would be the last character, the decimal point is removed and the cursor position jumps to the beginning of the input.\r\n\r\nDemo: https://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/94566/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe ShadowDOM case behaves like the other cases: when backspacing in the input, the cursor does not jump to the beginning of the input and the decimal point is not unexpectedly deleted.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16.2.0 + Chrome 62.0.3202.62 + OSX 10.12.6\r\n",
