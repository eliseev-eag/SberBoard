  "body": "Follow-up to https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13261. We couldn't land this fix internally because we rely on element-like objects (our translation tooling) being stringified inside an `<option>`. That works in other cases (e.g. `textarea` values), and worked in the past for `option` because it used to take the non-`shouldSetTextContent` codepath. But that created [other issues](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11911) which https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13261 solved.\r\n\r\nThis changes `<option>` to actually stringify its children. Should be a tiny bit faster to avoid those checks too, and makes it consistent with `<textarea>`. Note that in practice it already errors on objects. So the only thing that would get stringified are other React elements (e.g. a `<span />` inside of an `<option>`). Or things pretending to be elements.\r\n\r\nThis is not a breaking change because nesting other elements into `<option>` is already unsupported, and we always showed a warning about that.",
