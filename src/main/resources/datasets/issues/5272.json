  "body": "I'm aware of the [Iterable support for children](https://jsfiddle.net/aneo4nhk/), but is there any timetable for supporting [KeyedIterable](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/KeyedIterable) from Immutable.js, specifically for [automatically providing keys to children](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/ac5e5d789f022f0d13107e54653f13a8ede0330b/src/shared/utils/traverseAllChildren.js#L154-L159)?\n\nSample use case:\n\n``` js\nvar myItems = Immutable.Map({ // extends KeyedIterable\n  one: 111,\n  two: 222\n});\nvar renderedItems = (\n  <ul>{myItems.map(item => (\n    <li>{item}</li>\n  ))}</ul>\n);\n```\n\nThat is, the first item would end up the equivalent of `<li key=\"one\">111</li>`.\n\nIf such support isn't on the roadmap, can I somehow avoid having to use `React.cloneElement()` (which will have performance implications) if I write a helper function that does this?\n",
