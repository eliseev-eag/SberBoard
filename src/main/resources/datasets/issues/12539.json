  "body": "Currently we don't do any invariant transformation in www. It has its own pipeline which strips invariant messages completely. But that leaves us worse off because we don't have any codes at all.\r\n\r\nWith this change, prod www bundles will contain the error codes and a special `@preserve-invariant-messages` directive that will prevent stripping their messages (since thereâ€™ll only be one in practice).\r\n\r\nThe downside of this change is that with JS debugging parameter set to true but in PROD mode you'd have to click an extra time to see the error. Maybe that's not too bad if we fix the error dialog to linkify links.",
