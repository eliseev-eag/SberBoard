  "body": "The previous algorithm was pretty ad-hoc which resulted in edge cases like when it suggested `[props, props.onChange]` when `[props]` alone would suffice. This is a rewrite of it that instead maintains a data structure representing property chains. We mark the nodes that are *required* (i.e. used in the code), and then mark the nodes that are *satisfied* (i.e. specified in the dependency list).\r\n\r\nThat lets us precisely calculate the minimal necessary deps. (However, for effects we still allow extraneous deps when theyâ€™re already specified.) It should also open the door to making the rule smarter in the future (e.g. we should be able to extend this logic to suggest a parent object if we use >5 its properties or similar).\r\n\r\nSee inline comments and new tests.",
