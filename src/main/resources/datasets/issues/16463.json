  "body": "I have a particular pattern that I struggle with when navigating deep trees in devtools: I want to see all siblings of a node together.\r\n\r\nSay I'm in the middle of something and I wonder what are all nodes on the same level. It's super hard to actually get to that state. I wonder if we could tweak \"left\" button to do that as an intermediate state.\r\n\r\n* first press: collapse the current node\r\n* second press: collapse all siblings (new)\r\n* third press: move to the parent\r\n\r\nMaybe this is too crazy :-) Or maybe there's another mechanic that can achieve the same effect. The goal here is to be able to make sense of the tree structure by going _upwards_. Currently implementation details of children prevent me from seeing it. (At least, with the \"expand\" mode on â€” which is now on by default.)\r\n\r\n---\r\nOriginally reported by @gaearon via https://github.com/bvaughn/react-devtools-experimental/issues/384",
