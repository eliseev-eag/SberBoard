  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nCalling `this.isMounted()` in `componentWillUnmount` in prior versions would return `true`. Now it returns `false`.\r\n\r\nI believe this was untested behavior before, but the new tests that were added may check the wrong value: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/isomorphic/classic/class/__tests__/create-react-class-integration-test.js#L417 Changing this line to test for `true` will exhibit the behavior.\r\n\r\nThe fix would be to defer setting the  `__isMounted` flag to `false` until after all mixins and the `componentWillUnmount` method were called on the component.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n15.5.x and anything using `create-react-class` is broken. Working correctly in 15.4.x with `React.createClass`.\r\n",
