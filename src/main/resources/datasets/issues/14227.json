  "body": "I get this:\r\n\r\n> Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function.\r\n    in Camera (created by App)\r\n\r\nThe `useEffect` doesn't have subscriptions in itself.\r\nBut, it calls `startRaf()` from `useRaf` which creates a subscription. However, it comes with a cleanup function!\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n1. Visit https://codesandbox.io/s/81m4jm616j\r\n2. Click the \"Open In New Window\" icon (next to the address bar). This will allow you to enable the camera.\r\n3. Open the console.\r\n4. Click the \"Stop\" button.\r\n\r\nYou should see the warning above in the console.\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong in my hooks?\r\n\r\n",
