  "body": "It was introduced in #5713 but I disabled it in d138b286db4fcb7137f9267a30ec64b657d3cfb4 because we consistently got test failures on master. They appear to be caused by processes running out of memory due to coverage instrumentation overhead.\n\nWe should figure out a way to add the coverage reporting back. I’ve heard from @cpojer there are potential optimizations to be made in Jest to help mitigate this overhead. We can look into helping Jest deal with this.\n\nIf there is a way to increase memory cap for React tests on Travis maybe we could do that too.\n\nOne thing I wasn’t sure about is removing `set -e` in d138b286db4fcb7137f9267a30ec64b657d3cfb4. It was only present in `if` branch that used to handle the master so I removed it to be consistent with the `else` branch that handles the PRs. However I’m not sure why it was there in the first place, and maybe we should add it back. I’d love to learn more about this.\n\nLet’s keep this issue open until we have a specific plan to integrate coverage again without being red all the time.\n",
