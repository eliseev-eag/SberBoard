Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n[createContext issue](https://codesandbox.io/s/4j3m6l2l3w)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nContextProvider only affect the children node.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact 16.3.0-alpha.0",
