  "body": "Hi.\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nFeature request (I guess?).\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nCurrently `defaultProps` of component are resolved super early - when `React.createElement` is called. This makes shallow rendering for purposes of snapshot tests (with `enzyme` and `enzyme-to-json` - see  https://github.com/adriantoine/enzyme-to-json/issues/55) problematic: If component `A` has some `defaultProps`, they will appear in snapshots of all components that use this component. This makes testing very fragile - every change of `defaultProps` should affect only tests of component `A`, but currently it will affect many other tests.\r\n\r\nFor example if some component uses `A` without any props, this is what I would expect in snapshot:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div>\r\n  <A />\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut I am getting:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div>\r\n  <A someProps=\"some value from defaultProps\" />\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nResolve defaultProps at later stage, when they are actually needed, so that in snapshots appear only actually passed props.\r\n\r\nWill appreciate feedback, thoughts, workarounds and possible alternative solutions.\r\n\r\nHave a great day everyone! ;)\r\n\r\n",
