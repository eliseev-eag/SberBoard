  "body": "Good morning! I came across [this blog post](http://react-etc.net/entry/your-license-to-use-react-js-can-be-revoked-if-you-compete-with-facebook) which says that the BSD license of React is terminated if a React user competes with Facebook, as per the patent clause addition. There seems to be a lot of confusion around what the clause _actually_ means, so I was wondering if you might consider adding a tl;dr summarizing the clause and it's motivation in the readme. This would clear a lot of confusion up and let everyone focus more on building cool stuff. Thanks!\n\n---\n\n> ## Update from Maintainers\n> \n> We worked with our legal team to post a [FAQ](http://code.facebook.com/license-faq) addressing the most common misconceptions.\n",
