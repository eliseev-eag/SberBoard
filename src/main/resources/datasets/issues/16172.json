  "body": "This PR fixes an interesting bug that we encountered internally using the `Press` responder. When using mouse events (via pointer events or mouse events), we have a guarantee that the event target will be that of the one we're moving/releasing from (unlike touch events, which can have the same target as when the press was initiated). This mechanic for mouse events lets us bypass the `getBoundingClientRect` logic, which is:\r\n\r\n- expensive as it requires a layout reflow\r\n- can be incorrect in cases where children of the `responderTarget` are absolutely positioned\r\n- can sometimes report `width` and/or `height` as `0` when some CSS styles are applied\r\n\r\nThis behaviour already existed in the current Press implementation. But there were two bugs:\r\n\r\n- `isTargetWithinNode` wasn't taking into account the `alternate` fiber\r\n- we weren't setting `isPressWithinResponderRegion` to `true` if we knew the mouse event target was in the responder region (by using the targets).\r\n\r\nThis fixes both cases, which also fixes the internal bug we were seeing.",
