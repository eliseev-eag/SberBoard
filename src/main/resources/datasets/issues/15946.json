  "body": "This is the first Suspense feature that isn't actually dependent on IO.\r\n\r\nThe thinking here is that it's normal for a SuspenseList to show loading states, and it'll be designed to handle it one at a time.\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes there are lists with really big items that take a long time to CPU render. Since data can become available as we do that, it is likely that we have all the data and become CPU bound.\r\n\r\nIn that case, the list would naively just render until the end and then display all items at once. I think that's actually what you want for fast lists. However, for slow ones (like News Feed), you're better off showing a few rows at a time.\r\n\r\nIt's not necessarily one at a time because if you can do many in a short period of time and fit them all on the screen, then it's better to do them all at once than pop them in one at a time very quickly.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I use a heuristic of trying to render as many rows as I can in 500ms before giving up. I originally thought of making it configurable or having a special revealOrder mode for this but I have sense that this is not something people should have to think about too much and there are other possible heuristics we can add here later (such as if it will be below the fold or not). It seems like this would mostly just carry over to most cases.\r\n\r\nThis timer starts before the first row of the tail and we only check it after. This ensures that we always make a little progress each attempt. An alternative approach could be to start the time before doing the head of the list but we don't want that being slow prevent us from making further progress.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I disable this optimization at Never priority because there's nothing intermediate that becomes visible anyway.\r\n",
