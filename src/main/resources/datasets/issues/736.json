Looks like there are a few other minor differences because uglifyjs isn't quite idempotent but they appear to be harmless.\n\nFeels silly but I don't think there's another way. (We need to run uglify after as well so that require, module, exports are minified)\n\n```\n   raw     gz Compared to master @ f877c6224fbf217d639a0ef2d7abf28c4cfbafa4\n     =      = build/JSXTransformer.js\n     =      = build/react-test.js\n     =      = build/react-with-addons.js\n  -406   -129 build/react-with-addons.min.js\n     =      = build/react.js\n  -406   -108 build/react.min.js\n```\n",
