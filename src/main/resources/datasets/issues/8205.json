  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nFeature\r\n\r\nI would like a version of `React.cloneElement` that gives precedence to the props already on the component being cloned that were PASSED in but ignoring the ones that were provided by default.\r\n\r\nOrder of precedence\r\n1) Props provided to the Child component\r\n2) Props provided to the parent used to override the child component ones\r\n3) Default props on the Child component (i.e. prop was not provided to parent or child)\r\n\r\nHere is an example use case\r\n\r\n```\r\n<Button.Group color=\"blue\">\r\n  <Button color=\"red\" />\r\n  <Button />\r\n  <Button />\r\n</Button.Group>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe behavior I would like to achieve here is for Button1 to be red and button 2 & 3 to be blue.  The idea is that you can provide a single prop to the parent as the sort of default, but that individual components can override that default if they choose.\r\n\r\nI tried manually merging the props, but because the default value have already been supplied, there isn't really a reliable way to do this. \r\n\r\nThank you.",
