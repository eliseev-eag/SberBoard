  "body": "By internal react properties I mean `ref` and `key`. The current API design forces users to mix those two  into a single object. This is unfortunate in the case that the user wants to have props with the same name.\n\nThe `ReactElement` solves that problem nicely because it takes the `key`, `ref` and `props` as separate arguments. I understand that the current API is designed around a single props object, and the rest is treated as children. But I believe making explicit distinction between user supplied props and those used for internal purposes will lead to less confusion.\n",
