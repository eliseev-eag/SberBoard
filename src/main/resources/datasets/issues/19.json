  "body": "This PR just adds a submit button to the tutorial's comment form.\nA form has to either contain a submit button or an `action` attribute to be 'submittable' by pressing enter. IMO, the only other way to achieve this is to manually listen for keyboard events, which was implied by the tutorial but not included in the example source code.\n",
