  "body": "Due to the fact that HTML tables can't have children other than table rows, you cannot create parts of a table in a React element.\n\nHowever, tables are a very useful way to represent tabular data, especially since you can do colspan and rowspan.\n\nSo in the case of a table comprising of many sections, you have to resort to calling functions instead of elements, meaning you don't get the benefits of props, state and rendering short-circuiting, plus your code looks different and is therefore more error-prone.\n\nHow can this be improved? Can React support a virtual dom node that doesn't render an actual dom node but can have children?\n\nAlternatively, are there datagrid components that allow rendering like a table, with colspan and rowspan?\n",
