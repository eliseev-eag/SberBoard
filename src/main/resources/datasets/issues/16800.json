  "body": "Covers an edge case where an error is thrown inside the complete phase of a component that is in the return path of a component that suspends. The second error should also be handled (i.e. able to be captured by an error boundary.\r\n\r\nThe test is currently failing because there's a call to `completeUnitOfWork` inside the main render phase `catch` block. That call is not itself wrapped in try-catch, so anything that throws is treated as a fatal/unhandled error.\r\n\r\nI believe this bug is only observable if something in the host config throws; and, only in legacy mode, because in concurrent/batched mode, `completeUnitOfWork` on fiber that throws follows the \"unwind\" path only, not the \"complete\" path, and the \"unwind\" path does not call any host config methods.\r\n\r\nI have a fix, but it overlaps with a refactoring PR that I'm also working on, so I'm going to stack it on top of that.",
