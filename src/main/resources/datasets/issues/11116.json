However when using `setState` to save the call result, I get a pretty interesting error as you can see:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"418\" alt=\"screenshot of the code leading to the error\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8975443/31232986-b3805930-a9eb-11e7-80ce-63a15ba3d24c.png\">\r\n\r\nðŸ‘‡ gives you ðŸ‘‡ \r\n\r\n<img width=\"418\" alt=\"screenshot of the error\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8975443/31233024-cafc2d6e-a9eb-11e7-8a3e-63cbc9516e3d.png\">\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template for React 16: https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/, template for React 15: https://jsfiddle.net/hmbg7e9w/).**\r\n\r\nI tried to remove all the business logic and reproduce the error from my React Native app. Here is a CodeSandbox which fully reproduce it: https://codesandbox.io/s/pmo6okkz1x. \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI expected not to have this error.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nFrom what I know: this error occurs on any React renderer (got it on React Native in the first place), and started the project with React 15.5.\r\n\r\n**Related issues**\r\nMight be related to: #11081, #11086.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nPing: @gaearon ",
