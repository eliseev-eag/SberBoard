  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIn the text input, I can see leading zeros when I pass digit value.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/ebsrpraL/).**\r\nFor some reason, I can't reproduce this bug on jsfiddle or codepen. Moreover, react works fine there.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\n1. Create controlled text input and add `onChange` listener, which saves input value to `state` as an integer.\r\n2. Pass value from `state` to input.\r\n3. Write `0000001` to input. Value in `state` is equal to `1`, but value of input is `0000001`\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nA value in the input is the same as in the state â€” `1`. Without leading zeros.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nCRA, React 15.5.4\r\nChrome, IE 11/Edge, Firefox\r\n\r\nI understand that this is the very low amount of information, so I will be happy to provide more. Just need to know what else would be useful.\r\n",
