  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen using rollup in a project that imports the latest React `16.0.0-alpha7`, the bundle ends up containing both `react-development.js` and `react-production.min.js`, and the file size is unnecessarily large. \r\n\r\nMy guess - This happening because the entry point of react was changed recently to \r\n```js\r\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {\r\n  module.exports = require('./cjs/react.production.min.js');\r\n} else {\r\n  module.exports = require('./cjs/react.development.js');\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand rollup apparently[ cannot eliminate exports in dead branches](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/208) even when replacing `process.env.NODE_ENV` with production. \r\n\r\nUglify also cannot remove the dead code, because rollup seems to hoist `require`d stuff to the top level.\r\n**Online Demo**: Try building `react@next` using [this tool](https://cost-of-modules.herokuapp.com) that uses rollup to report package sizes. Compare that to searching for just `react`.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.**\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1) Import react in any project that uses rollup to bundle.\r\n2) Use [rollup-plugin-replace] (https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-replace) to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` with production.\r\n3) Use `rollup-plugin-node-resolve`,  `rollup-plugin-commonjs` and `uglifyjs` plugins  so that rollup understands commonjs exports and minifies stuff.\r\n4) Check the bundle size, it is 47.5kB. \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nSize should be much smaller.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nThe size is fine when using `15.4.2` because the entry point reads as\r\n```js\r\n'use strict';\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = require('./lib/React');\r\n```",
