  "body": "I just updated some code that was using React 0.11, and one of the errors I made was passing in class constructors:\n\n```\nReact.renderComponent(className(), document.body)\n```\n\nThe error this gave was `TypeError: this is undefined at react.js:5045`, which gave me no clue as to what was wrong. The problem, of course, is that `React.createElement(className)` needed to be passed in instead. I think this might be an easy error to catch and warn about to help out noobs like me :).\n",
