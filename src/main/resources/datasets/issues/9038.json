  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nSetting the value to `\"\"` on a `<select>` with `size` > 3 does not deselect the currently selected option.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\r\nJSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/rpbiwer/55jzq7dq/2/\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nAfter rendering a `<select>` with the value set to an empty string, I expect there to be no selection in the rendered select box. Mainly this expectation comes from this React warning when I use `null` instead of `\"\"`:\r\n```\r\nWarning: `value` prop on `select` should not be null. Consider using the empty string to clear the component or `undefined` for uncontrolled components.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the fiddle, if I change this line:\r\n```javascript\r\nlet newSelection = nowHidden ? \"\" : this.state.selected;\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```javascript\r\nlet newSelection = nowHidden ? undefined : this.state.selected;\r\n```\r\nI get the behavior I expect.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nI've gotten this with React 15.3.0 and whichever version is used in the fiddle. I don't know if it worked in previous versions.\r\nThis was tested using Chrome 56 on OS X.",
