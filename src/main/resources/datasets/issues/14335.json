  "body": "Hi React community,\r\n\r\nI'm here to report a bug about the onselect event and its triggering use case. This is my first issue here, hope i've done it right.\r\n\r\nUsing this code :\r\n```javascript\r\nclass App extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return(\r\n      <React.Fragment>\r\n        <input name={\"testhtmlinput\"}\r\n                    onSelect={event => {\r\n                        console.log(\"input onSelect is triggered\");\r\n                    }}\r\n                />\r\n      </React.Fragment>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(\r\n  <App />, \r\n  document.getElementById('app')\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFound behavior :\r\nWe observe onSelect event is triggered on focus, on click, on any text keydown and on left and right keydown.\r\n\r\nReact version and browsers :\r\nThis example has been written using a react 16.6.3 codepen. This issue has been found using react 16.4.2. I've seen this bug on firefox 60 and chromium 70.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior :\r\nonSelect event should be triggered only when one or more characters are selected within the input.\r\n\r\nSee this html and js example :\r\n```javascript\r\n<input name={\"testhtmlinput\"}\r\n                    onselect=\"myFunction()\"\r\n                />\r\n\r\nfunction myFunction() {\r\n\t\tconsole.log(\"input onSelect is triggered\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is what w3schools says about :\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Definition and Usage\r\n> \r\n> The onselect attribute fires after some text has been selected in an element.\r\n[w3schools : HTML onselect Event Attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ev_onselect.asp)\r\n\r\nWhat is the problem with this issue ? :\r\nonSelect should be used for a specific behaviour but with your implementation it's fired in too many cases, then it's pretty much impossible to isolate the native behaviour and make it works fine.",
