  "body": "At now, for sync mode, we will call `flushSyncCallbackQueue` after `scheduleCallbackForRoot`, but seems all works been done in `flushSyncCallbackQueue`, `scheduleCallbackForRoot` just to push callback in syncQueue. The question here is, `scheduleCallbackForRoot` will trigger rAF + postmessage(only use postmessage a few days ago), so here the rAF/message callback(`performWorkUntilDeadline`) is Unnecessary, you will find that it just execute meaningless code(go to flushWork and return because the work has been done in `flushSyncCallbackQueue`). So, could we avoid this or I miss something, please let me know, thanks!",
