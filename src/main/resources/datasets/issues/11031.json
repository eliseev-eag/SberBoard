  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nI'd like to request documentation. :-)\r\n\r\nWhen you pass `null` as `value` of an input, you get the following warning:\r\n\r\n> warning.js:33 Warning: `value` prop on `select` should not be null. Consider using the empty string to clear the component or `undefined` for uncontrolled components.\r\n\r\nThis warning very clearly states what to do. My problem is, it fails to mention *why* I'm not supposed to pass `null`. Nor could I find any explanation online:\r\n\r\n* I found a link to <http://facebook.github.io/react/tips/controlled-input-null-value.html>. The URL (...controlled-input-null-value...) sounds as if this page should explain exactly what I'm looking for. But it merely redirects to <https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html>, which doesn't mention `null`.\r\n* The issue [\"Warn when input's value is null\"](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5013) states that this warning should be added, but doesn't say why.\r\n* The (open) pull request [\"Document that `value={undefined}` is not controlled component\"](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9849/files) adds the following documentation: \"Similarly to not setting the `value` attribute at all, setting it to `null` or `undefined` will make React assume the component is not controlled and may produce a warning.\" But again, there is no explanation as to *why* React behaves this way.\r\n\r\nNaively, I'd expect `null` to be a perfectly valid value, e.g. for a numeric input that is empty. Passing an empty string to indicate the absence of a numeric value seems odd to me. So I'd really like some more information in the documentation!",
