Use the latest available v15.* prop-types package from npm instead. For info on usage, compatibility, migration and more, see https://fb.me/prop-types-docs\r\nWarning: Accessing createClass via the main React package is deprecated, and will be removed in React v16.0. Use a plain JavaScript class instead. If you're not yet ready to migrate, create-react-class v15.* is available on npm as a temporary, drop-in replacement. For more info see https://fb.me/react-create-class\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI expect these deprecation warnings not to throw. The `import * as React` syntax is now [recommended in FlowType](https://flow.org/en/docs/react/components/) and this is causing issues for end users in several libraries I author. See e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/mzabriskie/react-draggable/issues/276).\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThis is in React 15.6.1.\r\n",
