  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nI don't want to call it a bug, but more of a suggestion and open to discussion!\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI was debugging an issue on a webapp today where if you typed a character into an input element within a modal, the element would immediately lose focus and further keypresses won't go into the input (not the best UX!)\r\n\r\nAfter looking at keyboard event handlers, focus, blur, etc. and not finding answers, I eventually drilled it down to this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport * as React from 'react'\r\nimport * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\r\nimport { useRef, useEffect } from 'react'\r\n\r\nconst portalRootEl = document.getElementById('#top')!\r\n\r\nexport const Portal = ({ children }) => {\r\n  const containerElement = useRef(document.createElement('div'))\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    const el = containerElement.current\r\n    portalRootEl.appendChild(el)\r\n\r\n    return () => {\r\n      portalRootEl.removeChild(el)\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  return ReactDOM.createPortal(children, containerElement.current)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue was useEffect's 2nd parameter should've been an empty list (i.e. `[]`) to prevent the portal being destroyed and recreated every single time.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI know this can be attributed to developer error, but perhaps encouraging engineers to specify the 2nd argument can help prevent very hard to detect and pernicious bugs like this.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.8 but anything with hooks really",
