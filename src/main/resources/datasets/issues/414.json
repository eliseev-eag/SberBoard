  "body": ":exclamation: **Don't Merge Me** :exclamation: \n\nI'll keep updating this as new authors come in right up until we release 0.5, but I wanted to open this up to give everybody a chance to specify the name they want to show up in the `AUTHORS` file. It looks like some people had names set up in their `.gitconfig` (or were internal authors), but for others it seems your github username was used. So if your name is on this list, let me know what you'd like to see listed!\n- [x] @SanderSpies\n- [x] @Samangan\n",
