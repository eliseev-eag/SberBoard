  "body": "I want to report a bug(or at least that's what I think it is)\r\n\r\nI assigned the value of a state(say X) to a local variable in a method. Making any change in that variable and calling setState() to change the value of any other state(say Y) changes the value of X as well. Exactly the same change that I did in the local variable. \r\nI am not using setState to change the value of X. I am using it to change the value of Y. Yet X changes as well in exactly the same way as I changed the local variable which was earlier initialised using X.\r\n\r\nHere is the demo of the problem: https://jsfiddle.net/jainabhishek2604/vkms2acq/2/\r\n\r\nClicking on the button changes the numbers which are rendered using the state \"test\". Clicking the button invokes a method where the value of X is stored in a variable \"arr\" whose first indexed is then spliced. setState is them called passing an object changing the value of the state \"temp\". But the \"test\" is updated as well with the value of \"arr\".\r\n\r\nI am using react version 15.6.1 on chromium running on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.",
