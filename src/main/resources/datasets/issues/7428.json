  "body": "I've been working a lot with the `ReactDOMInput` wrapper to fix IE and Chrome bugs and I've noticed that a good portion of the code exists to prevent attributes from being assigned in the wrong order, and for inserting them in a specific way.\n\nSo that got me curious about benefits centralized, ordered, property assignment might yield. I'm interested in:\n1. Eliminating special attribute assigning ordering cases. Like assigning `type` and `step` before `value`.\n2. Eliminate _most_ special `value`, `defaultValue`, `checked`, and `defaultChecked` assignment order code.\n\nI've been investigating that by reimplementing my Chrome backspace fix  https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7359 with more logic moved to `DOMProperty`. Code from `ReactDOMInput` can be eliminated because of guarantees in property assignment order. I'm very curious if it could be eliminated from the other wrappers and other DOM utilities.\n\nThis work is here: https://github.com/facebook/react/compare/master...nhunzaker:nh-ordered-props. I sort of hesitate to share, but I'm curious if this the type of thing you would accept as a contribution, and is it safe to do this work in parallel with the React Fiber feature?\n\nIf so, I was going to start reproducing all of the edge cases fixed by the wrappers, and start working towards reducing the amount of \"rule breaking\" they require to get properties to assign as expected. Otherwise, I guess I have a much better understanding of how property assignment works :).\n",
