  "body": "_**feature** request_\r\n\r\nNowadays we migrate much of our use-cases from complexes of high order redux actions+ HO selectors + HO reducers (I call it HOXes) to react hooks. Hooks allow us easier to incapsulate blocks of functionality rather it was possible with redux infrastructure, when we had to use our complex complexes to avoid much of copy-paste.\r\n\r\nOne drawback is lack of history of changes and more poor devtools at all. We creates many `useDebugValue` helpers, loggers and so one now.\r\n\r\n**expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n- show history of hook state changes with dom and js stack traces, diffs and maybe even history traversing\r\n- allow more precisely editing of values in devtools. Currently I cannot choose number or string or bool or object when I edit prop or state value\r\n- allow copying the state name in devtools (remove css no-action pls)\r\n- add something like $r.state back\r\n- preview complex values brifely like chrome devtools does it for arrays, sets, maps, objects,,,\r\n\r\nI [wrote related twit](https://twitter.com/mxtnr/status/1178271362890240001) recently with one my DebugValue helper\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nall are latest\r\n\r\n",
