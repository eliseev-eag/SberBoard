  "body": "This is the old issue with \"Invariant Violation: findAllInRenderedTree(...): instance must be a composite component\". I know this was brought up before and it was somehow declared ok, but it keeps causing trouble in my tests, so I thought I'd give this one more shot.\n\nThe problem: You cannot search for a custom component within a DOM node. I made a [sample](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/pgXGbe) to illustrate the problem.\n\nThe sample is a simplified version of a real problem I'm facing - I have a DataGrid component that renders a bunch of Row components, which in turn render a bunch of Cell components. Each Cell can either render some readonly text, or some custom component passed via props (custom editor). \nI want to turn the Cell into a functional stateless component for better performance. \n\nNow I have a problem in my tests  - for a given Row, how can I find the custom editor in Cell with given index? Previously (React v <=0.13 I think) it was possible to find the div rendered by given Cell and within this div, find the custom editor. That is no longer possible. Also, since Cell is a stateless functional component, you cannot locate it using the Test API at all.\n\nI really believe that the testing API is incomplete right now, is there any change you guys could take another look at this?\n",
