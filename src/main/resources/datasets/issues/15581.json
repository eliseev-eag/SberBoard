  "body": "https://github.com/chase-moskal/webp-hero is an IMG element webp polyfill solution with a simple straightforward demo that executes `<script>` tag after loading DOM IMG elements  \r\n\r\nThis has proven to be less simple for React with console messages like \"document object does not exist.\" being reported in safari for the execution steps from the demo/sample code.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/chase-moskal/webp-hero/issues/18  seems to be moving towards this resolution but there is a timewise and skill-wise deficit to date among the onlookers and participants.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to update my understandings of React and I'm able to use safari and [Firefox 63](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/63.0) to test the lack of webp support from the perspective of supporting a serverside role and having pulled the trigger on a webp format conversion for a large repo of icons and images to refactor a legacy collection of mixed image formats.  The contractors for this effort have provided a React codebase and the webp-polyfill demo was good enough assurance up until this integration glitch.\r\n\r\nReact appears to be rendering in a web worker where the chosen webp polyfill is searching for a DOM entrypoint to execute a function.  \r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly  [this polyfill](https://github.com/ai/offscreen-canvas)   ensures a uniform interface for offline canvas being present.  \r\n\r\nthe author of the webp plugin states that this polyfill provides a good enough contract to proceed with a webworker solution iiuc \r\n\r\nThat is all I know at the time of this post.  any assistance in knowing where to look and what needs to happen for img tag rendering is greatly appreciated.",
