  "body": "A few weeks ago when teaching my friend, she got stuck on `this.state.value` vs. `event.target.value`. As the documentation talked a lot about \"values\", and the term \"value\" could mean three different things (values in general, the `value` prop / DOM value of the `<input>` component and the `value` in state/props), it was not weird that she got a bit confused.\r\n\r\nI asked about this already from @gaearon in Twitter here: https://twitter.com/valscion/status/833776451442843649",
