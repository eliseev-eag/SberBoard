  "body": "If set an inline style attribute for a component, such as `backgroundColor: 'yellow'`, and then update the state with a bad value to make the inline style like this `backgroundColor: 'non-exist-color'`. This currently takes no effect on the component, and the backgroundColor will remain yellow. (live example: https://jsfiddle.net/d6me6fca/ )\n\nI suppose this is not the correct behavior, the old value should be override by new value, even the value is non-standard, so it can fallback to use the parent style just like plain HTML. If leave the previous style as is, the behavior of component will lose connection with component state, the style will become chaotic and unpredictable.\n",
