  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nFeature. I would like the ability to see props in the component tree, like in React DevTools version 3, not just in the sidebar.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nAs of React DevTools 4.0.5, the component tree does not show a component's props:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110000/63395824-d98f0a00-c379-11e9-94a5-7d7ada53238f.png)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would like the ability to toggle an interface more similar to React 3.6.0, where the props were shown in the tree. Please excuse the annotations on the following photo, I'm reusing it from https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/issues/1361.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110000/63395853-f4fa1500-c379-11e9-8f84-580bf2803f5b.png)\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nAs described in https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/issues/1361, the problem with showing props in the sidebar, but not in the tree, is that it's common for me to scroll upward through the tree to try to find where an event handler is registered. If I have to click a component to get it to show a function prop like `onSelectValue`, that makes my search for the handler more difficult.\r\n\r\nNote that the previous implementation showing props in the tree appeared to be broken in part, as described by https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/issues/1361.",
