  "body": "Right now, the NPM package just distributes files that are good to be used with Node.js. You must precompile them with some build system before you can use them.\n\nWould be really nice to have the same files of the [Bower package](https://github.com/reactjs/react-bower) distributed in a `dist` directory (both react.js and react-dom.js) or something like that, as NPM is now also being used for client-side package management.\n",
