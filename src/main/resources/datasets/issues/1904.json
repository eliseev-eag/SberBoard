  "body": "When using Lodash's _.uniqueId() function as a key property's value I was experiencing a bug that would re-render the entire DOM. I had a scrollable window with checkboxes, on checkbox change the entire DOM would re-render causing the window to scroll to the top. I was using the PureRenderMixin and treated the state of all components immutably.\n\nWhen I changed the key property to use the same value and/or removed the key property completely this bug no longer persisted.\n",
