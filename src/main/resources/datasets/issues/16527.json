  "body": "Hi, long time user, first time issuer.\r\n\r\nI think I found a bug with the Profiler component. When I click on the `Save profile...` button at the top nothing happens and there appears to be no new files in my Downloads folder. I think it might be silently failing and that's why I am not getting any response.  Has anyone else ran into this issue?\r\n\r\nAnother thing I would like to mention is that I haven't looked through all of the documentation material about the new Profiler. I only read [this introductory blog post](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html), so if this issue is addressed elsewhere I apologize and also request the source to that solution.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!\r\n\r\n**Versions:**\r\n * `React DevTools 4.0.5`\r\n * `Firefox: 68.0.2(64-bit)`\r\n * `Ubuntu: 18.04`\r\n",
