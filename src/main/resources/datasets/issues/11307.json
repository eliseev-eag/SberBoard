  "body": "The concept of Task priority was originally added as a way to avoid reentrancy. Sync priority is for work that flushes synchronously, and Task is for work that flushes at the end of the event loop.\r\n\r\nBut it turns out that in most cases, it's simpler to model Task and Sync as the same priority level. For example, it's never correct to flush Sync work from the update queue without flushing Task. Doing so can lead to infinite update loops.\r\n\r\nAnd using a separate priority level is not necessary to avoid reentrancy. We already track when work is being rendered, and exit before entering the render cycle again. That alone is sufficient.\r\n\r\nThis commit removes Task priority from the codebase. Now we use the same level for both truly synchronous work and work that is deferred until the end of the event loop.\r\n\r\nThis also enables us to remove DOM-specific legacy cases from the  reconciler and lift them to the renderer.",
