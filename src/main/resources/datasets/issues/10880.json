  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nA bug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThe first challenge at the end of the tutorial says `Display the move locations in the format \"(1, 3)\" instead of \"6\".`\r\n\r\n* It suggests that we are already displaying the locations of the moves, but we are not!\r\n* It doesn't specify where the move locations should be displayed either.\r\n\r\nThis makes the challenge unclear.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI'd change the text of the challenge to `Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in each history link`, or something similar.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nv16",
