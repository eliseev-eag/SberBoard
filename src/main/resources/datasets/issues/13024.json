  "body": "We need a different \"component tree\" thingy for Fabric.\r\n\r\nA lot of this doesn't really make much sense in a persistent world but\r\ncurrently we can't dispatch events to memoizedProps on a Fiber since\r\nthey're pooled. Also, it's unclear what the semantics should be when we\r\ndispatch an event that happened when the old props were in effect but now\r\nwe have new props already.\r\n\r\nThis implementation tries to use the last committed props but also fails\r\nat that because we don't have a commit hook in the persistent mode.\r\n\r\nHowever, at least it doesn't crash when dispatching. :)\r\n\r\n",
