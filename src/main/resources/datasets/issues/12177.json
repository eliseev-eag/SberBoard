  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIf you remove the ref from a mounted HostComponent on an update, it calls the original ref with null. If you remove the ref from a mounted ClassComponent on an update, it does *not* call the original ref with null.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/q8k7776pz9 Note that it doesn't call ref1 (passed to FooInner as ref) with null\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/849538y8m8 Note that it **does** call ref1 (passed to div as ref) with null\r\n\r\nIf you *modify* the ref from either a HostComponent or a ClassComponent (change from `ref={this.ref1}` to `ref={this.ref2}`), the original ref (ref1) is called with null and the new ref (ref2) is called with the instance.\r\n\r\n(take the sandboxes above and change the second `<Foo>` to `ref={this.ref2}`\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nHonestly not sure but it should be consistent. The reason this is different is because for HostComponents, [we decide to schedule a Ref effect on completeWork](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/87ae211ccd8d61796cfdef138d1e12fb7a74f85d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberCompleteWork.js#L464-L466) as long as `current.ref !== workInProgress.ref`. For ClassComponents, [this decision is made on beginWork ](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/87ae211ccd8d61796cfdef138d1e12fb7a74f85d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L184-L188) as long as `workInProgress.ref && (!current || current.ref !== workInProgress.ref)` -- which means if workInProgress.ref is null, the behavior is different (hence this issue). \r\n\r\nWe should probably pick one and make it consistent. \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nUnsure - it for sure is an issue in latest/Fiber, but I haven't dug deep enough to see what happened in <16.",
