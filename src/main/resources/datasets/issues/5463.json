  "body": "Context: Drag and Drop on a tree of components\n\nhttp://codepen.io/anon/pen/Qjzabb\n\nDragging between siblings items (c1-8 for example) works fine. for avoiding some bugs [1] I need to access the dragged item dimensions (offsetWidth/Height), it works only if he's mounted, but it works fine with 2 items in the same parent. \n\nBut when dragging an item (c1-8, d1-8) from one container list to the other one, the element gets successively removed from its list and added to the root component, then added to the other list. I even see componentDidMount being fired in console, but its .isMounted() returns false when continuing to drag over the other list, that's what's strange, the switching still works but only with [1b] so less user-friendly. When releasing the drag and dragging inside that list it will work well again, .isMounted() will be true\n\nOther point onDragEnd is not fired, when the parent of drag changes\n\nIn the code, I do nothing particular in `onDrop` or `onDragEnd` that could explain why it sudddenly works after releasing the button, `onDragStart` simply sets the dragged component in a global state, everything happens in `onDragOver`, \n\n[1]:  (when dragging an element over one with smaller or equal dimensions [a] I switch them instantly, else [b] I wait until I cross the half to avoid infinite switchings)\n",
