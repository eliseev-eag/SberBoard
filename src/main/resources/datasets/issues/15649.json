  "body": "Currently there are several default behaviors that should have associated aria attributes, for example alt text for `<img>` and `<svg>` or components with certain navigation or mouse event behaviors.\r\n\r\nIt would be really cool if those conditions that would be pointed out by tools like Lighthouse/WAVE/axe could issue `console.warn` statements on render, where reasonable for non-production builds.  This could guide developers towards at least taking care of a lot of the low hanging fruit in this regard.\r\n\r\nPossibly done in conjunction with an `ariaset` property as mentioned in #1259.",
