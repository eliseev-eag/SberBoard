(But `undefined` values don't seem to be passed, generally).\r\n\r\n  ```js\r\nconst GoodComponent = () => <div hullaBallo={undefined}>Should not warn</div>;\r\n```\r\n...produces...\r\n\r\n> Warning: React does not recognize the `hullaBalloo` prop on a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as lowercase `hullaballoo` instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent component, remove it from the DOM element.\r\n\r\nDemo: https://codepen.io/pixelbandito/pen/mYWWby?editors=1111\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n1. If a component puts a mixed-case prop with a value of `undefined` on a DOM element, it doesn't throw a warning.` values don't seem to be passed down anyway).\r\n  ```js\r\nconst GoodComponent = () => <div hullaBallo={undefined}>Should not warn</div>;\r\n```\r\n2. If a component puts a mixed-case prop with a value on a DOM element, throw a warning.\r\n  ```js\r\nconst BadComponent = () => <div hullaBallo=\"foo\"}>Should warn</div>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior would help me write terse wrappers that pass props down to their children. In my actual use case, I have a `inNewTab` prop that uses [prop-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) to set a default of undefined. I'd like to pass props down to children in most cases without worrying about whether the `children` prop will be a component or a bare DOM element.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI tested with React 16.8.6, because that was the current version listed in npm\r\n",
