There's a bunch of things that will break in advanced mode but we're gradually moving closer to being able to do this. \r\n\r\n<s>I think https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9955 is a prerequisite since otherwise we can never be sure we're still being correct.</s> Landed!\r\n\r\nOpen question is if we can still keep DevTools working. I wonder if Fiber could be an array with fixed indexes and then we wouldn't need any \"sourcemapping\".",
