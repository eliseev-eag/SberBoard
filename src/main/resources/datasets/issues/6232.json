  "body": "I've built a task execution pipeline utilizing React v14 and I've begun testing it against React v15 and have noticed that all of a sudden I'm getting an invariant error: _React DOM tree root should always have a node reference_.\n\nWhen I comment the line that is causing this error (https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/3b96650e39ddda5ba49245713ef16dbc52d25e9e/src/renderers/dom/client/ReactDOMComponentTree.js#L171) everything works as it did with v14, and all of my unit tests pass. I assume this check is important to the new internal updates that have been made since v14.\n\nI was able to make it work with a hacky bit of code that adds properties to the instance, `_flags` and `_nativeNode`, you can see this here: https://github.com/mbrio/react-pipeline/blob/react-15/src/startTasks.js#L8-L9.\n\nI believe the issue is that with v14 I was able to use the server rendering code but in v15 I can no longer call `forceUpdate` or `setState` without errors occurring. Is there a way of bypassing the above error using the client renderer, or a way of calling `setState`/`forceUpdate` with the server renderer?\n",
