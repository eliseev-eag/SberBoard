  "body": "Our \"getting started\" experience is pretty rough.  A user comes to our site wanting to learn about React, and we start telling them about es6, npm, babel, webpack, gulp, and a whole ton of other infrastructure-related stuff.  This is all super important and does belong in our documentation, but it's a bit much for a new user who just wants to get a \"Hello World\" example working.\n\nThis is the first step toward solving https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5679.  It gives us a page where we can talk about configuring es6/npm/babel/webpack/gulp/bower with React.  We can freely add stuff to this page without worrying about complicating our getting-started-with-React experience.\n\ncc @zpao \n",
