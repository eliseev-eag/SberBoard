  "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBUG\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen setting up an `onPaste` handler, react provides two choices: `onPaste`, or `onPasteCapture`. In both cases, the DOM event.currentTarget is the #document (which is reasonable given how react's delegate behavior works), but the `eventPhase` is `3` (aka bubbling) in BOTH cases.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar \r\nhttp://jsbin.com/dacolavipe/edit?js,console,output\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nExpected is that `onPasteCapture` fires when the DOM event is in the capture phase. This is needed to be able to manipulate the paste handler properly when playing focus games on Edge\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nLatest version of React, affects at least Chrome and Edge, but I suspect it is browser/OS independent.\r\n",
