Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.2.0\r\n\r\nI'm not certain if this is the behavior prior to React 16 (pre-Fiber), but Fiber supports and encourages the use of fragments (i.e., arrays of elements); as such, this issue is much more likely to be encountered in React 16 onward.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the above code just reads like something is wrong.\r\n\r\n_How many children do I have?_ **1.**\r\n_May I have the only child?_ **No, I expected you to only have one child.**\r\n_Um, okay._",
