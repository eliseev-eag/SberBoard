  "body": "If a tree is marked as needing a remount, there is no use traversing it to schedule more work inside it. It will be thrown away in either case.\r\n\r\nThis PR restructures the code a little bit to implement this optimization. It also adds a test that verifies we always batch hot reload updates. This was already the case, but the test makes me feel more confident that we won't accidentally remove batching. Batching is important because otherwise we'll have a deep cascading update that will be super slow.",
