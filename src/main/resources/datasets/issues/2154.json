  "body": "We should create a new benchmark suite for patterns that are relevant to React.\n\nWe should write test for four different target audiences:\n- JS Engine (Low-level micro-benchmarks of important language features like Object.assign)\n- DOM Engine (Low-level micro-benchmarks of document.createElement, innerHTML, cloneNode, updating and setting the .style property etc.)\n- React Core Engine (Low-level and real worlds tests of the React algorithm before the DOM layer.)\n- Integration Benchmarks (Real world DOM tests that benchmarks the whole thing.)\n\nWe need to figure out what format to use for all these benchmarks and how easy they are to incorporate into the engines' benchmark suites.\n\nWe should also set up a more stable CI environment to track regressions. The one we have now is too noisy.\n",
