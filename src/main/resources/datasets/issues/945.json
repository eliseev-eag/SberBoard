  "body": "This is closely related to #455, but not entirely the same.\n\nI'm curious how one'd go around to testing browserified backbone + react apps. It appears that [react doesn't play well with phantomjs](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/347), so I'm looking for alternatives. [Jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) is next on the list, and I'm looking for suggestions how to properly handle this.\n\nAn issue that arises when using `browserify` and not loading the app through an html template is that you're not actually testing against the DOM and can't do things such as `<script src='vendor/react.js'></script>` to load packages into the global scope.\n\nDo you have any ideas, theorems or suggestions on how to approach unit testing without phantomjs?\n",
