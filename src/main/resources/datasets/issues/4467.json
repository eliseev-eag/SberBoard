  "body": "Let's say I'm including the React prod build from a CDN with a script tag.\n\nIf I want `import React from 'react'` to get this version, what's the ideal webpack config to do that?  Of course I could do:\n\n```\nalias: {\n  react$: './getWindowReact'\n}\n```\n\nWith `getWindowReact.js`:\n\n```\nexport default window.React;\n```\n\nBut I'm thinking there has to be a better way.  I've seen surprisingly few articles talk about how to use the production build.  Most just cover the dev case.\n",
