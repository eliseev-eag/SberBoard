  "body": "It seems that `props.children` are undefined if a component does not have children defined up front but instead are defined during parent component rendering.  I request that, once a component has been mounted, `props.children` should always contain the valid representation of the component children.\n\nThe use case for this is to allow deep iteration of child components (without having to worry about if some components have defined children).  A specific example would be to  find all nested components (input fields) that set data on a Backbone Model.\n\nnote:\nI realize that you might say that these components should set model values when the input fields are changed (and no need for deep traversal) but ideally, I don't want to actually update model data until the form is completely filled out.\n",
