  "body": "This PR is a complete replacement for the work suggested and originally started in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15261.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims add doing the following:\r\n\r\n- Support ReactDOM rendering `<TouchHitTarget>` elements. These elements can have optional numerical and nullable `top`, `left`, `right` and `bottom` props.\r\n- Support server-side rendering of these the hit targets along with their hit slop properties.\r\n- Support hydration from server-side rendered content for these hit targets.\r\n- Host configs now get additional methods: `getEventTargetChildElement` and `commitEventTarget`.\r\n- Tests mainly covering ReactDOM/ReactDOMServer support.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I found that we can't actually test the hit slop logic in JSDOM because it doesn't support a bunch of the DOM APIs that `<TouchHitTarget>` and respective event responders use. We'll need to come up with a different strategy for that, maybe @necolas has some ideas.\r\n\r\nRef #15257",
