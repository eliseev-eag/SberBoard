  "body": "Facebook is a signatory to [_'We Are Still In'_](https://www.wearestillin.com/signatories) which pledges corporate support for the Paris Climate Agreement.  Would it be against the principles of the React project to acknowledge this on the `README` with a badge?\r\n\r\n[![Climate rating](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paris%20Climate%20Agreement%3A%20Facebook-%E2%9C%93-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://www.wearestillin.com/signatories)\r\n\r\nClimate change is an immense and time sensitive issue which affects us all.  Acknowledging Paris on the repo would provide reassurance to contributors and users that as the host/guardian of React, FB is committed to a positive future for the planet.  The badge links to [wearestillin.com](https://wearestillin.com/) - the declaration which Facebook signed acknowledging their commitment to the Paris Agreement.\r\n\r\nI understand this isn't your typical PR and is my first contribution to React.  But every bit of awareness about climate change makes an impact and this is a pretty positive diff from just a few ASCII characters üôåüåç\r\n",
