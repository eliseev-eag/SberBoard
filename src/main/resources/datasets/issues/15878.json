  "body": "This PR is a follow up of https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15871. I intended to break this all down into smaller PRs, but was unable to do it without breaking the tests. Everything is quite coupled. I was however, able to extract out the changes we wanted from #1571 without changing how everything fundamentally works. This PR does not drop using Pointer Events and switching to touch events like the other PR and works like everything does today â€“ so this is far less risky.\r\n\r\nNotably, the changes and fixes are as follows:\r\n\r\n- We now check the `target` correctly from touch events using `document.elementFromPoint`, fixing several iOS issues.\r\n- We now ensure both pointer and touch events match their ID. This allows for multiple touches to occur without causing them to conflict with one-another (this also applies to pointer events).\r\n- There was a regression with `contextmenu` blocking long press on touch devices. This fixes that.\r\n- We now expose `pointerId` and `pointerType` on the responder `event` object. This is far cleaner and faster than how we did this before, plus it's less code! For cases where we don't have a `pointerId`, the default is `null`.\r\n- I cleaned up some parts of the code that duplicated conditions and tried to unify them into hoisted declarations with nice names.\r\n- I pulled in the tests from #15871 (they have much better touch input mocking) and manually inlined `elementFromPoint` into the Jest tests because JSDOM doesn't have support for it.\r\n\r\nExample URL: https://codesandbox.io/s/experimental-event-api-v2-2rqnr",
