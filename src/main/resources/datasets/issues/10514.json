  "body": "The keypress synthetic event guards against non-printable keys sent from firefox. It makes an exception for the Enter key since it can be printable.\r\n\r\nWhen the ctrl key is pressed, the charCode for Enter is 13 in firefox but 10 in other browsers.\r\n\r\nThis fix enables ctrl + Enter keypress on other browsers. It doesn't modify the event itself, just returns 13 when charCode === 10\r\n\r\nreferenced in issue #10515 ",
