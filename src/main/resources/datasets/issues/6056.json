  "body": "Is there a preferred method or performance benefit to hiding a node in the dom via css vs mounting and unmounting it?\n\nFor example, I have a render function with the following code:\n\n``` javascript\nconst {map} = this.context;\nlet selectedFeature;\nlet content;\n\n//- Infer the selected feature from the info window\nif (map.infoWindow && map.infoWindow.getSelectedFeature()) {\n  selectedFeature = map.infoWindow.getSelectedFeature();\n}\n\nif (selectedFeature !== undefined) {\n  content = [<Analysis selectedFeature={selectedFeature} />];\n} else {\n  content = [<Instructions />, <Tools />];\n}\n\nreturn (\n  <div className='analysis-panel custom-scroll'>\n    {content}\n  </div>\n);\n```\n\nand I am wondering is this is preferred over something like this:\n\n``` javascript\nreturn (\n  <div className='analysis-panel custom-scroll'>\n    <div className={`${selectedFeature === undefined : 'hidden' : ''}`}>\n        <Analysis selectedFeature={selectedFeature} />\n    </div>\n    <div className={`${selectedFeature === undefined : '' : 'hidden'}`}>\n        <Instructions />\n        <Tools />\n    </div>\n  </div>\n);\n```\n\nThe first snippet mounts and unmounts the node, and I feel this is cleaner in the Analysis component since I know selectedFeature will always be defined and I don't need any conditional code in this snippet or the Analysis component.  But this can change very frequently in the application so I was wondering if one method is preferred or more performant over the other? (If performance is the same I will probably go with the first snippet as it feels cleaner to me and Im guaranteed to have a value for selectedFeature)\n",
