  "body": "The test renderer has its own mock implementation of the Scheduler interface, with the ability to partially render work in tests. Now that this functionality has been lifted into a proper mock Scheduler build, we can use that instead.\r\n\r\nThe changes to the test are mostly a straightforward find-and-replace. There were a few that relied on dynamic injection to override the `now` HostConfig method. I updated those tests to use Jest module mocking instead.",
