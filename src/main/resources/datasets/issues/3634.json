  "body": "**Note:** I'm not sure if this is the correct place to issue a PR for JSXTransformer, because I was unable to find any associated tests. I'm thinking that JSXTransformer is more of an internal Facebook product, and you simply include it into this repository &ndash; hence it residing in the `vendor` directory. C'est la vie!\n\nI've modified JSXTransformer to allow it to transpile JSX documents when they're loaded via HTML imports. Currently `runScripts` is invoked once on `DOMContentLoaded` and then garbage collected, since the implementation has been abstracted away. This will keep it alive for any top-level HTML imports &ndash; but will not wait for HTML imports of those HTML imports, unless `JSXTransformer.js` is included again :+1: \n",
