  "body": "While I was debugging a problem reusing server-rendered markup, I was thrown off the track for a while because React was telling me there were differences in various entity encodings and attribute representations between the server- and client-rendered markup. For instance, the server markup would contain `&nbsp;` while the client would contain a literal `\\u00a0` character. Also, empty attributes on the client would be rendered as `attribute` whereas the server markup would show `attribute=\"\"`. After finally realizing that the real problem was in fact a different string being rendered on server vs client, I came up with this method to present more useful information when this situation arises.\n",
