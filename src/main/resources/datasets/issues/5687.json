  "body": "Addresses the core of #554. ping @jimfb @spicyj \n\nThis plugin is getting large...personally I'd break it out into smaller modules but I didn't want to presume that here, so its all together. The other thing I didn't do was make the obvious DRY changes. There is a common pattern of tracking the active input used by three code branches that could be refactored into something a bit more concise. I have that change locally if ya'll feel like its appropriate for this PR otherwise I can leave the repetition.\n\nThere is also a larger question of whether it makes sense to just run all (or more than just ranges) inputs through this branch, which would also address annoyances similar to #3377 and #3484. That's a sweeping change though and, again, didn't want to presume.\n\nI need to actually test this on old IE (Edge fires input events) but I don't have the vm set up at the moment.\n",
