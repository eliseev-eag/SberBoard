And I have to add a class to that stack and remove tha class when disks leave.\n\nStacks need to know that state, disks need a reference to that state so they can change it when dragging is finished(onDragEnd). Which means I have to put it where both components can find it.\nAt last I put the state in my model, which holds my three stacks. `from` refers to the stack that dragging event started, and `dropping` refers to the stack the dragging disk is hovering.\n\n``` coffee\nstore =\n  a: [1..12]\n  b: []\n  c: []\n  from: null\n  dropping: null\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/jiyinyiyong/react-hanoi/blob/master/coffee/model.coffee#L5\n\nBut it's still bad idea to put state in my model. Is there a better solution for such case?\n",
