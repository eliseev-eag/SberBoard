Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt should testing my jest tests.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nI am running this on mac on the command line.  Using npm run test which defaults to running jest in package.json.  I am using babel 7.0.0 version.  Any guidance on how I might debug this further would be great.  Happy to debug but would need some pointers on where to look for the issue.  I searched for typeof4 in @babel but there is no string.  \r\nVery superficially, (and I could be wrong) I suspect that babel is transpiling the regenerator runtime and when it does it ends up on this problem.\r\nThanks for any help that will unblock me.\r\n\r\n",
