  "body": "### Note: This proposal has been discussed in https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/64.\r\n\r\nRemoves support in master for using arbitrary promises as the type of a React element. Instead, promises must be wrapped in `React.lazy`. This gives us flexibility later if we need to change the protocol.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that promises do not provide a way to call their constructor multiple times. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst promiseForA = new Promise(resolve => {\r\n  fetchA(a => resolve(a));\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven a reference to `promiseForA`, there's no way to call `fetchA` again. Calling `then` on the promise doesn't run the constructor again; it only attaches another listener.\r\n\r\nIn the future we will likely introduce an API like `React.eager` that is similar to `lazy` but eagerly calls the constructor. That gives us the ability to call the constructor multiple times. E.g. to increase the priority, or to retry if the first operation failed.",
